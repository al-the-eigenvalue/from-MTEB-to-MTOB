“‘Here you will stay” he told me.’ STE/VC
Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

" Transitive clauses have two arguments, a subject (A) and an object
(O). The basic constituent order in Moseten is A V O.251 This word
order can easily be varied, with different pragmatic effects.

"A maximum of two arguments, subject and object, can be referred to
by the verbal cross-reference ending. In this way, three-argument
ditransitive clauses formally have two core arguments. The word order
in intransitive clauses is usually S V. In transitive clauses, the basic
constituent order is A V O. This order can be changed due to pragmatic
status. Identifiable referents are often pro-dropped, i.e. they are
exclusively referred to by the verbal cross-reference ending and do not
occur as a pronoun or as a full noun phrase.

The basic constituent order in transitive clauses changes when an
argument is represented as a personal pronoun. Primarily subject
participants are represented as personal pronouns, whereas personal
pronouns in object position are extremely rare. Therefore, I will
consider only two types of clauses with personal pronouns here: 1. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP object and 2. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a pro-dropped object.
",3.0,SVO,[409],5,5,0.8445269490396529,1
" When several participants are identified in the context, subject
participants are often realized as personal pronouns and can also occur
in subject position. In this case, the pronoun disambiguates which
identified participant the speaker is talking about.252 In clauses with a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP in object position,
word order is (as a tendency) generally V A O, instead of A V O:
(12:15) M e’-katyi’ ji-yiw'i-i-’mi ’phen.
 so-EH pass-VY.M.S beat-VI-3F.O 3M.SG woman
‘So he went on beating his wife.’ STE/EC
This word order is also predominant with 1st and 2nd personal pronouns,
which cannot appear as a full NP:
 Verbal clauses 377
(12:16) Rai’s-e-’ ja e ’ma vae oi phe-ya-k-dye’
want-VI-3F.O DM 1SG DE.F talk-VY-MI-NO
dyaba-si’.
peanut-L.F
‘I w ould like (to hear) the story about the peanut.’ COE/JH
Still, other constituent orders are found with pronominal subjects. When
the object of the clause is pro-dropped, the predominant order is A V:
(12:17) M e’-ki-ki j a e ’ma m i’ mis-e-’.
so-CO-RD DM3M.SG talk-VI-3F.O
‘So (change in referent) he talked to her.’ STE/EC
Apart from appearing independently in the clause, personal pronouns
can also be cliticized to the verb (see also section 5.1.). Primarily 1st and
2nd person pronouns in subject position appear as clitics:
(12:18) Khin ’-ra ’ kaw-e- ’-mi!
now-IR see-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Now you will see!’ WTE/JH
3rd person pronouns usually only appear as clitics in constructions with
the quotative verb yi- ‘say’:
(12:19) ... ye-’-md ’ yij
 say-3F.O-3F.SG footprint
‘...she said to (the) footprint.’ STE/EC
As opposed to independent personal pronouns in transitive clauses,
these clitics can, in very few cases, also cover object functions in the
clause. They exclusively appear with 1st and 2nd person:253
(12:20) “I-ya’-ra ’ mi bae’-i!”yi-n-yae.
",3.0,SVO,"[409, 410]",5,6,0.8802617926316133,1
"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.
",3.0,SVO,[425],5,7,0.9084315859943712,1
"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:
Verbal clauses 375

",1.0,,"[407, 408]",1,8,0.8641487744166266,0
" When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",2.2,,"[425, 426]",3,9,0.8572647810868068,0
"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:
(13:54) M e’-ki ja e ’ma menbae’-e-dye’ aj-win m o’-tyaka ’
so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",2.2,,"[435, 436]",3,14,0.8259137730489693,0
" The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form

forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

" Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

"3F.SG housebig
‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",2.2,,[430],3,27,0.8636417520693477,0
" Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’
3F.SG-FO-CO one-F frog 3F-ADwait-VI-AN-F.S
 yo-dye’-si’-tom-ra’ phi-ki.
",2.2,,[458],3,28,0.8788792730032389,0
" With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",2.2,,"[459, 460]",3,29,0.8937522914211912,0
" Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

"The nominal morphology is rather simple, and most nominal
 modification is carried out by clitics. The same is the case with
 adjectives, adverbs and particles. Exceptional in nominal and adjectival
14Introduction
morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.
",1.0,,"[46, 47]",1,32,0.8959016049208713,0
"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

" As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

" When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

"The antipassive marker -ti- can furthermore appear with the verb yi-
‘say’, expressing that a quotation is a request. In this way, the
antipassive is similar to the imperative (8.1.5.) is used in direct speech
to express requests. In the following example, a man asks another
person to do something, which is expressed by the imperative in the
quoted speech. The verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive marker
-ti- in order to express that the preceding quotation is a request:

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses

Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

" Wayne Gill belongs to the North American protestant New Tribes
Mission and has been a missionary with the Chimane people since the
early 1980s. Interested in languages, he learned Chimane and created a
writing system for the language. He printed a Chimane-Spanish and
Spanish-Chimane dictionary, published school books and religious
booklets (all under the name of Mision Nuevas Tribus). Furthermore, he
translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament. For new
missionaries, starting at the mission with the Chimane, he wrote a
“teach-yourself-Chimane” manuscript, consisting of grammatical
information, religious phrases and everyday speech. The grammatical
information is very good and reliable. He is continuously collecting
words for a manuscript dictionary of Chimane-English, which in 1999
consisted of more than 5000 words and derivations of words, - and
example clauses for most entries.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.

" Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

combination of ‘take from another person’ and ‘for a reason’:

‘We have bought a cow from someone (we know what to do
with it) in order to sell meat.’ ele /AT, lm
In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

" In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:

‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

" Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

"144 Adjectives and adverbs
 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’
IP buy-VI.M.S DE.M canoe.E DE.F-B-L.M girl

three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
