"Section 9 shows that the origin of some verb prefixes can be traced one
stage further back, in that several postpositions can be seen to have originated
from nouns or demonstrative locative words. Section 10 attempts to suggest
the possible future course of the process of prefixation, and mentions its
relevance to other types of verb prefixes.
2. General overview of some features of Nadtb
The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information
about Nadeb grammar to facilitate an understanding of the hypothesis
presented in this paper. For a fuller description of several aspects of the
grammar, see Weir (1984).
2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure
The structures of the sentence and of the verb, postpositional, and noun
phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified
expansions:
S4 (NP) NP VP(PP)
 I IPP \NP
 1bdv f
VP --tIncV
PP -+NPP
NP 4 N
 S Det
 I S
In the expansion S + (NP) NP VP (PP), the first NP functions as direct
object and the second as subject, i.e. Nadeb has a basic constituent order OSV,
3 Prefixes are usually associated more with VO than with OV languages.",3.0,OSV,[5],5,1,1.0,1
"Several unusual features, some very peripheral to the present topic of study,
have been noted in passing. These include basic word order, prefix ordering
rule, restricted choice of relative clause head, and the whole area of incorpora-
tion into the verb phrase. These, and other areas of Nadeb, will be the subject
of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

"In the expansionof the VP, V representsthe verbroot(s) and suffix(es),
while Inc represents the prefix(es) and incorporated element(s). Note that this
use of the term ‘verb phrase’ differs from that of various linguists, for whom
this term refers to the verb plus its complement(direct object). In NadEb, since
the direct object is separated from the verb in the basic order, it would not be
very meaningful to speak of such a ‘verb phrase’.

assumption that these reflect an older VO order (for which, in fact, there seems
to be little evidence; word order is mentioned in section 2.1, and discussed in
more detail in Weir (1980, 1984: 270-284)).3 It also predicts the possible
future appearance of further prefixes, and the extension of certain subclasses
of prefixes (relational, subordination, and derivational).
",2.3,"No dominant order, SOV, OVS, OSV, VSO",[5],4,4,0.85765460333638,1
"The expansion NP --f S Det describes the structure of relative clauses, where
Det represents the head of the relative clause, and is realized by one of two
determiners;doo, indicating specific reference, and peh, indicating non-specific
(including hypothetical)reference. The expansionNP + S describes the
structure of headless relative clauses. In NadEb, headless relative clauses and
other relative clauses represent two different relativizationstrategies, and a
headless relative clause cannot be considered merely as a relative clause whose
head has been deleted. Headless relative clauses allow wider possibilitiesfor
the constituents which can be relativized,and generallyoccur in contexts
different from those of other relative clauses.5
2.2. Classification, form, and ordering of verb prefixes
Nadeb verb prefixes are classifiedin six types, as summarized below.
(i) The formative prefix, a-, which generally accompaniesa main verb root
in the absence of other prefixes, elements incorporated into the VP, or
proclitic pronouns; i.e. the prefix a- is inserted in an empty Inc in the
surface structure, in the absence of a proclitic pronoun which would be
attached to the verb.
(ii) The multi-function aspect prefix, i-, which occurs obligatorily in all
 contexts with some verbs and only in certain contexts with others.
4 Argumentsin support of the statement that Nadeb basic constituent order is OSV include
intuition, both that of the linguist in question and that of native speakers; the pattern of nominal
incorporation (head of intransitive subject or head of transitive object) relative to the verb stem
(incorporated elements always precede the verb stem); alternativeword orders (acceptableand
unacceptable), and statistical predominance.",3.0,OSV,[6],5,5,0.9012545936293016,1
" 308E. M. H. Weir 1 Nad2b verb prefixes: diachronic development
 8.2. In relation to relative clauses
 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),
 respectively(examples(6e), (8d), and (10~)).

‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
(8d)etmi-soom doo
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(10~) et- ba-gk doo
‘the one in which my father is’
In each case the function of the prefix is to advance the modifier NP in a PP to
direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",0.0,,[18],0,6,0.8175954836306293,0
"The present behaviourof these postpositionsand verb prefixes and the
different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in
a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

"Certain thematic prefixes, however, clearly have a
different origin, for example, in onomapotoeias(as with the verb pa-Muah
‘break in pieces’) or in loan words (as with the verb mu-xikh ‘say mass’, which
is a loan word from Lingua Geral, an old Brazilian contact language still
spoken in some areas).

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",0.0,,[23],0,10,0.6518256357249584,0
" The aspect prefix, i-, when present, occurs in position nearest to the main
verb root. The basic form of all derivational, thematic, relational, and
subordination prefixes is Ca-, but the prefix nearest to the aspect prefix, when
this exists, combines with it, resulting in the form CL. When more than one
prefix occurs with the same verb root, their relative order is determinedby
surface form, rather than by types or meanings.",1.0,,[7],1,11,0.647647588329173,0

"Weir / Nadtib verb prefixes: diachronic development305
which my father shoots’.8 In this headless relative clause, the prefix ma-
indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).
(10a) ee a-gti tabb6
 father formative-be = in = hammock house ablative
 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",0.0,,[15],0,13,0.6357903400250219,0
" For example, the prefixes ya-, da-, ta- and la- follow na- and precede ha-; ya- precedes
da-; but the available data does not reveal the relative order of ya-, ta- and la-, nor of da-, ta- and
la-. The presenceof two na- prefixes in the table is due to the fact that the derivational negative
prefix na- may co-occur with another na- prefix (derivational or thematic).",1.0,,[7],1,14,0.6401604038469383,0
"In the correspondingnegative relative clauses, the presence of the negative
prefix na- does not exclude any of these three prefixes, in accordance with their
interpretation as relational, rather than subordination, prefixes (examples (6g),
(8g), and (1Of)).
(6g)tt ga-na-hingdoo
father inside-negative-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father does not go downriver’
(8g)te ma-ni-soom doo
‘the one with which my father does not shoot’
(1 Of) et ba-na-gti doo
‘the one in which my father is not’
8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

 house ablative father RA-be = in = hammock
 ‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
 (10e) tabbQte a-gti
 house ablative father formative-be = in = hammock
 ‘In the house my father is.’
 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with
any adverbial in pre-verbal position, except PPs of means and those which
contain an object of comparison. With the former the prefix ma- (discussed in
the previous section) is used, while the latter do not occur in cleft sentences.
This is illustrated with a temporal adverb, yiti ‘tomorrow’ in (1 la); with an
adverb of manner, kayah ‘slowly’ in (12); with an indirect object, kalaptt hG
‘to the child’ in (13), and with another PP, hx66h g6 ‘in a canoe’ in (6f). All
these forms are interpreted as cleft sentences, and the prefix ba- indicates in
each case that the subject is a headless relative clause in which the relativized
constituent is an adverbial.

8. Comparison of the behaviour of the verb prefixes ga-, ma-, and ba-
 It is now possible to compare the behaviour of the three prefixes ga- ‘inside’,
ma- ‘by means of’, and ba- ‘ablative’, starting with the intransitive clauses (6a),
@a), and (10a).

" Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

for verb prefixes.

2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP

it affects an increasing proportion of relevant lexical items. These features - change affecting a

relevant items and eventually replacing the older - are also seen in the process of syntactic change

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart

 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.

" A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon

 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

 The inspirationfor the title of this paper comes from two sources. The first

 languages, viz. that ‘previous changes in any language inevitably leave their
 footprints behind them’ (1981: 105). The second source is Given’s paraphrase
of an early analect, ‘Today’s morphologyis yesterday’s syntax’ (1971: 413).

8.5. Summary
In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

 This non-cooccurrenceof the prefix ba- with the negative na- is in contrastto
 their cooccurrencein (lOf), which confirms that here ba- functionsas a
 subordination prefix, while in (1Of) it functions as a relational prefix.
8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).

" 6) The postposition y6 ‘on top of’.’ There is, for some verbs only, along
with the incorporated postposition form a verb prefix variant identical
in meaning. The incorporated and prefixed forms cannot occur in the
same sentence with a PP which contains the corresponding postposition
(section 3).
 (ii) The-postposition hC ‘dative’. The verb prefix variant exists for all verbs
along with the incorporated postposition form, but with a strong
preference for the prefixed form (section 4).
 (iii) The postposition g6 ‘inside’. Only the prefixed form, and not the
incorporated postposition form, is acceptable. In main clauses, for a
few verbs, there is a semantic change in the prefixed form, as opposed
to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).
 (iv)The postposition me ‘by means of’. The semantic change in the
prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-
tains a headless relative clause (section 6).
 (v) The postposition bti ‘ablative’. The prefixed form does not occur in
 main clauses, but only in relative and headless relative clauses. Such a

" Lightfoot points out some of the deficienciesof,
among other things, one of the fairly generally accepted basic assumptions of
internal reconstruction, viz. that ‘morphologicalpatterns will partially recapi-
 tulate the syntax of an earlier stage of the language in a consistent way’ (1979:
 160). He shows that morphology is not only ‘very slow to adapt to syntactic
changes, but also it mirrors earlier syntax only in a selective way’, concluding
 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax
because, while each of the individual forms reconstructed may be accurate,
 there is no reason to suppose that they each reflect the same earlier stage,
whether they reflect the syntax of 500, 1000 or 2000 years ago’ (1979: 161).
This last point is also made by Chafe (1959: 481). In the light of its
limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely
as a prelude to the comparative method.

" In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).

‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing

 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
