"My typological survey of constituent orders in 130 languages (Tsunoda 1991:
266–290) looks at the surface level, and not at any underlying level. Among these
languages, only Slavey (North America) has exactly the same orders (at the sur­
face level) as in Warrongo (at the ‘compounding’ level), i.e. noun-adjective, noun-
numeral, SVi, and AOVt. The following ten languages, too, have these orders, but
they allow some other order(s) in addition to SVi and AOVt: Mizo (India), Diyari
(Australia), Omaha-Ponca, Hualapai, Navajo, Eastern Pomo, Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Dakhota, and Yuchi (all North America). That is, roughly speaking, about 10% of
the languages surveyed have noun-adjective, noun-numeral, SVi, and AOVt (and
some other order(s)), at the surface level. That is, the discrepancy in Warrongo
noted above – between noun phrases and clauses at the ‘compounding level’ – is
crosslinguistically not uncommon at the surface level.
4.6.2. Constituent order in phrases
The order of constituents in phrases was already discussed: noun phrases in 4.5.2,
adverb phrases in 4.5.3, and verb phrases in 4.5.4. In NPs, the numeral follows the
noun proper more frequently than it precedes. This tendency conforms to the order
of the noun proper and the numeral in a compound noun: (a-1) in 4.6.1. However,
the adjective-like noun precedes the noun proper more frequently (as do the geni­
tive and the demonstrative). This tendency does not conform to the order of the
noun proper and the adjective in compound nouns: again (a-1). That is, the relative
order of the noun proper and the adjective-like noun in a compound noun does not
match the more frequent order of these two constituents at the surface level.

As noted above, among the six logically possible orders, (b) (AOVt) is the most
frequent. In elicitation, too, AOVt is the usual order. For transitive clauses, AOVt
may be considered the unmarked order. Also, this is the order that is observed in
the compound noun of (a-4) (AOVt), discussed in 4.6.1. Here again, the order in the
compound noun matches the most frequent order (among the six logically possible
orders).
[3] Discussion
(a) Non-configurationality at the clause level
As seen above, the relative order of the S and Vi, and also that of the A, O and Vt
are not fixed. (The same applies to the relative orders that include other arguments
and adjuncts, although they were not discussed above.) Furthermore, as seen in
4.5.2 (noun phrases), 4.5.3 (adverb phrases) and 4.5.4 (verb phrases), the constitu­
ents of a given phrase may be discontiguous (except for a small number of phrases
that are configurational). That is, Warrongo is non-configurational at the clause
level.
(b) Conditioning factors for the order of the constituents
It has proved extremely difficult to determine factors that may condition the relative
order of the constituents – of independent clauses and main clauses that are used
as affirmative declarative sentences. For example, an examination of their order in
terms of the following factors has not produced any significant result: (i) given-vs.-
new, (ii) topic-vs.-comment, and (iii) focus. Nonetheless, there is at least one factor
that seems to influence their relative order, namely, repetition of the verb.
",3.0,SOV,"[406, 407]",5,2,1.0,1
" Word order is fairly free, but there are a small number of restrictions or ten­
 dencies. For example, interrogative words and the question marker wayi tend to
 occur sentence-initially. Also, word order is fixed in a few types of noun phrases
 and probably in a few types of verb phrases, and Warrongo is configurational re­
 garding these phrases, although it is in the main non-configurational. Warrongo
 discourse is often highly elliptical.
1.2. Names of the language and people
In Aboriginal Australia the name of a language is often used to refer to the people
in question as well (cf. Dixon 1980: 41).

" The examples cited above start with the A or the O. There are a small number
 of instances which start with the Vt (more specifically the order is VtAO) and in
which the verb is repeated. That is, the sentence has the form ‘VtAOVtVt(Vt…)’,
 e.g. (164), (4-165). Again, the verb involved is often, though not always, jaynyja-L
‘copulate with’: (4-164).

 Consider Table 4-11, which concerns intransitive clauses that occur in the texts
 of Tape 72/31. Table 4-11 shows the following. When the order is SVi (167 examples
380Syntax
in all; 100%), the verb is not repeated in 147 examples (i.e. 88%), and repeated
in 20 examples (i.e. 12%). In contrast, when the order is ViS (26 examples in all;
100%), the Vi is not repeated in 15 examples (58%), but it is repeated very fre­
quently, namely in 11 examples (42%). That is, there is a fairly close association
between the ViS order and the repetition of the Vi.

The situation is different with transitive verbs. First, as noted above, the repeti­
tion of a transitive verb is less frequent than is the case with intransitive verbs.
Second, on the basis of the small number of examples, there appears to be no asso­
ciation between the VtA order and the repetition of the Vt. Thus, among the seven
examples (100%) of VtAO, it is only in one example (14%) in which the verb is
repeated; see (4-122). The figure is 42% for the intransitive counterparts; see Table
4-11. Generally the A precedes Vt irrespective of whether the verb is repeated or not.
4.6.3.3. Constituent order in those independent clauses and main clauses which
are used as imperative sentences
As seen in 4.2.1.1, imperative sentences do not always contain a verb. Where a
verb is contained, it is not always in an imperative form. The following discussion
will be concerned with the most common imperative sentences, i.e. those which
contain a verb in a general imperative form. The situation is different between
intransitive and transitive imperatives. (The texts in Tape 72/31 were examined for
the statistical information given below.) As noted in 3.10.8-[2]-(h), the S/A of general
imperatives is overtly expressed far more frequently than elliptical.
[1] Intransitive imperatives
Their word order tendency is much the same as that of declarative intransitive sen­
tences (4.6.3.2-[1]). That is, the SiV order is the usual one. Examples (not necessarily
from Tape 72/31) include the following. (i) SVi: (3-139), (3-186), (3-265), (3-288-A),
(ii) ViS: (3-54), (3-261), (3-262-B), (3-266-A), (iii) Vi: (3-100), (3-111).
[2] Transitive imperatives
As seen above, where an intransitive verb is involved, the SVi order is more fre­
quent than the ViS order in each of declaratives and imperatives. However, the
 Order of constituents381
situation is slightly different where a transitive verb is involved. The number of
general imperatives involving a transitive verb is small, but the tendency is as fol­
lows. In the main, the relative frequency of the six logically possible orders is the
same as in declarative transitives; see 4.6.3.2-[2]. For example, (i) OVtA and (k)
VtOA are the least frequent, and they are not attested in the texts of Tape 72/31. But
they are attested elsewhere in the texts.

" Clauses that are used as negative sentences generally involve an adverb for
 negation, such as nyawa ‘negation’, ngalnga ‘prohibition’ or some other adverb
which has some kind of negative sense (4.2.2.). Unlike wayi ‘question’, the position
 of these adverbs is difficult to generalize about. Examples are given in 4.24-[2],
-[3], -[10], -[11].
4.6.3.2. Constituent order in those independent clauses and main clauses which
 are used as affirmative declarative sentences
As stated in 1.1 and 4.1, word order in Warrongo is fairly free, and it is very dif­
ficult to generalize about. Nonetheless, we shall look at the order of the A NP, the
 O NP, and the S NP in clauses that contain a verb. This is partly in view of the at­
 tention that has been paid to the order of these constituents in typological studies
 (cf. Greenberg 1978). We shall exclude other arguments and also adjuncts (cf. 4.4)
from the following discussion.

"Now, if we are to set up an underlying level for Warrongo at which the com­
pounding rule applies, then this language will have the orders shown in (a-1)
through (a-5) at this putative level. (Compound verbs are excluded.)

 Vt                A, O(a-4), (a-5)
According to the widely accepted head-vs.-dependent dichotomy (see Nichols
1986: 57), the noun is the head, while the adjective and numeral are dependents.
The verb (Vi or Vt) is the head, while the A, O, and S are dependents. See Table
374 Syntax
4-10. Then, at the putative level where compounding applies, Warrongo will have
the following orders.
(a) ‘Head-first’ order in (a-1), i.e. in noun phrases.
(b) ‘Head-last’ order in (a-2) through (a-5), i.e. in clauses. (The verb is compound-
 final.)
That is, there is a discrepancy between these NPs and clauses in terms of the order
of head and dependent, as far as this putative level is concerned.

"Stress in reduplicated words was discussed in 2.7-[3].
 3.7.3. Compounding
Compounding involves two different roots, i.e. ‘XY’. They are of the following
types. The first member is always a noun. (‘Noun’ refers to a ‘noun proper’,
‘Adjective’ to an ‘adjective-like noun’ (3.1.1), and ‘Numeral’ to a numeral (a type of
noun) (3.1.2-[3]).)
 242Word classes and morphology
 [1] No verb is involved: Noun-Noun, Noun-Adjective, Noun-Numeral, Numeral-
 Numeral, Noun-Adverb.
 [2] The second member is a verb: Noun-Verb.
 Noun-Noun and Noun-Adjective are the most common, and also there are a fair
 number of examples of Noun-Verb. The relative order of the members within a
 compound noun may be taken to reflect the ‘underlying’ word order. See 4.6.1.

To sum up, adverbs of direction/destination are almost always contiguous with
a verb, and in terms of contiguity, such an adverb and a verb are configurational.
Furthermore, (in the examples available) gani ‘far, away’ and a verb are always
contiguous and their relative order is fixed. They are configurational in terms of
both contiguity and fixed order. They constitute a phrase in a rigid sense. Also,
golmi ‘back’ and the verb, too, are almost always configurational in terms of both
contiguity and fixed order, constituting a phrase in a rigid sense, except for (4-151).
4.6. Order of constituents
The order of constituents (cf. Greenberg 1978) can be discussed in terms of words
(4.6.1), phrases (4.6.2), clauses (4.6.3), and sentences (4.6.4). (The following discus­
sion is largely repeated from Tsunoda 1990.)
4.6.1. Constituent order in words

the following order.

 ation.) Between (a) (SVi) and (c) (ViS), (a) is by far the more frequent, and (a) may
 be considered unmarked. In elicitation, too, (a) is the usual order. Examples of (a),
 (b) and (c) in Text 2 (Tape 72/28) follow. (a): Lines 1, 2, 6, (b): Line 8, and (c): Line

 excerpt from Tape 72/28.)
 As noted in 4.6.1, compound nouns that consist of a noun in the nominative (the
 S) and an intransitive verb have the order of SVi. This order matches the unmarked
 order of (a) (SVi).

 are as follows.

 is attested elsewhere in the texts. Among these six orders, (b) (AOVt) is the most

 alize about it. This is in sharp contrast, say, with English, where their relative order
 is fixed, e.g. these three big books of mine. In this respect, Warrongo deviates from
 Greenberg’s (1978: 111) Universal 20: ‘When any or all of the items – demonstra­

The absence of the purposive-1 (-lgo) in the jussive and the complementation uses

 purposive-1 is unacceptable in these uses, in contrast with the purposive-2 (-yal).

As stated in 4.6.4-(a-2) and 4.8.2, the purposive clause almost always follows the

‘In expressions of volition and purpose, a subordinate verbal form always follows
 the main verb as the normal order except in those languages in which the nominal
 object always precedes the verb’.) However, there are just a few exceptions, in which

"There are, however, a small number of exceptions. In some of the noun phrases
(4.5.2.2.2 and 4.5.2.2.6) and some of the verb phrases (4.5.4.2-[2]), the constituents
are contiguous with each other and they are rigidly ordered. Consequently, they
may be considered as phrases in a rigid sense. Warrongo is configurational as far
as these noun phrases and verb phrases are concerned. But it is non-configura­
tional elsewhere, i.e. in terms of other phrases and also at the clause level and the
sentence level.
4.5.2. Noun phrases
Noun phrases (‘NPs’) can be divided into two types: (i) non-configurational NPs
(4.5.2.1), and (ii) configurational NPs (4.5.2.2). The former do not constitute NPs
in a rigid sense, while the latter do (to varying degrees). The former are common,
 342 Syntax
while the latter are exceptional. The modifier in the latter is generally a personal
 pronoun in the genitive. (Warrongo differs from languages such as English and
Japanese in that non-configurational NPs, rather than configurational NPs, are the
 norm or common.)

"Specifically, in (4-119), (4-121) to (4-123), only the last member of the NP (the
modifier) is case-marked. In (4-120), only the first member is case-marked. Here
possibly we are dealing with enclitics, and not suffixes. (In languages such as
Nganhcara of Cape York Peninsular (Smith and Johnson 2000: 421) and Warlpiri
of Central Australia (Hale 1967) it seems common for the last constituent only of an
NP to be case-marked. Gooniyandi of Western Australia (McGregor 1990: 173–174)
has twelve postpositions that mark case, e.g. the ergative. They are ‘typically occur
one per phrase’, being ‘attached to any word in the phrase’.)
[2] Configurationality
In terms of the two criteria for identifying configurationality proposed in 4.5.1
((b-1) contiguity and (b-2) fixed relative order) the NPs discussed above are con­
figurational to varying degrees:
(a) 4.5.2.2.2, 4.5.2.2.6: configurational in terms of both (b-1) and (b-2).
(b) 4.5.2.2.3, 4.5.2.2.4, 4.5.2.2.5: configurational in terms of (b-1) only.

"Order of constituents375
We shall exclude subordinate clauses from the following discussion. The reasons
for this are as follows. As mentioned in 1.1 and 4.1, Warrongo discourse is highly
 elliptical. Furthermore, an NP in subordinate clauses is often deleted under core­
ferentiality with an NP of the main clause; see 4.8.4, in particular. Consequently,
 subordinate clauses consist of even fewer constituents than independent clauses
 and main clauses, and this makes it extremely difficult to investigate the order of
 their constituents.

"Complex sentences of the type (a-1) are configurational in terms of both of the
criteria set up in 4.5.1: (b-1) contiguity and (b-2) fixed relative order. The main
clause and the subordinate clause are contiguous, and their relative order is fixed.
That is, they are strictly configurational. Complex sentences of the other types are
not.
4.7. Verb formation: -bi-L ‘INTR’, -nga-L ‘TR’, and -(m)ba-L ‘TR’
Most of the verb-stem-forming suffixes were discussed in 3.11.1. However, the
transitive-stem-forming suffixes -nga-L (4.7.2) and -(m)ba-L (4.7.3) are most con­
veniently discussed in the chapter on syntax (i.e. Chapter 4), as will become clear
in the relevant sections. Verbs formed with -nga-L often exhibit behaviour parallel
to that of verbs formed with the intransitive-stem-forming -bi-L (4.7.1), and -bi-L,
too, is most conveniently discussed in the chapter on syntax.

"The NPs that have been discussed so far are non-configurational, for they fail
to meet either of the criterion (b-1) ‘contiguity of the constituents’ and (b-2) ‘fixed
relative order of the constituents’ (see 4.5.1).
4.5.2.2. Configurational NPs
There are four types of configurational NPs. The modifier is generally a personal
pronoun in the genitive, and it is first necessary to describe the behaviour of the
genitive in NPs.

 4.5.1. Introductory notes
The following types of phrases may be conveniently set up for Warrongo: noun
 phrases (4.5.2), adverb phrases (4.5.3), and verb phrases (4.5.4). However, in the
 main, what are labelled ‘phrases’ below do not constitute a phrase in a rigid sense.
The reason for this is given below. In this connection, a discussion of configura­
Types of phrases341
tionality (cf. Hale 1983) is in order. Configurationality may be classified as follows,
although authors such as Hale (1983) do not seem to make this distinction.
(a-1) Phrasal configurationality, or, configurationality at the phrase level, which
 concerns the constituents of a phrase, i.e. words.
(a-2) Clausal configurationality, or, configurationality at the clause level, which
 concerns the constituents of a clause, i.e. phrases.
(a-3) Sentential configurationality, or, configurationality at the sentence level,
 which concerns the constituent of a sentence, i.e. clauses.

" These verb phrases are configurational (in terms of both contiguity and fixed
 order) and they constitute phrases in a rigid sense, except for (3-149).
 [2] Verb phrases consisting of a verb and an adverb
 (a) Wonaja wona-Y ‘camp out’. The adverb wonaja ‘camping out’ and the intran­
 sitive wona-Y ‘lie’ seem to be configurational (in terms of contiguity and fixed
 order), constituting a phrase in a rigid sense. See (3-16).
 (b) Crosslinguistically, ‘directionals’ seem often (or generally?) to occur next to the
verb (cf. Foley and Van Valin 1984: 212). In Warrongo, too, adverbs of ­direction/
 destination are almost always contiguous with the verb, e.g. (3-291) (goyay-ngal
‘across-to’ immediately follows the verb), (4-177) (ngarra ‘up’ immediately fol­
 lows the verb), and Text 1, Line 16 (gola ‘upstream’ immediately follows the verb).
Among adverbs of direction/destination, golmi ‘back’ and gani ‘far, away’ need to
 be commented on separately.

 posive-1’ and -y-ng-ga ‘apprehensional’. This is in order to show their formation.
 However, in sentential examples, they are each shown as one single unit, e.g. -lgo
 and -yngga.

"Restrictions (?) on the use of instrumental verbs
Here, we shall look at possible restrictions on the use of instrumental verbs. The
restrictions that apply to both locative verbs and instrumental verbs are mentioned
in 4.14.4.
4.14.3.5.1. Inflectional suffixes
As noted in 4.14.3.1, instrumental verbs almost always occur with the purposive-1
(-lgo). Comments on the nonfuture-1 and the apprehensional are in order.

" Intransitive clauses contain a NOM NP for the ‘intransitive subject’ (‘S’). (They
may contain some other words.)
 Some of the verbless clauses ((a-2)) may be considered elliptical, with the verb
understood. For example, in (4-1) and (4-2), yani-ya ‘go-IMP’ may be considered
understood, and yani-n ‘go-NF’ in (4-9). However, for some other verbless clauses
it is difficult to supply a verb, e.g. (4-3), (4-4), (4-11), (4-12), and they will have
to be considered genuinely verbless. Unlike some Australian languages such as
Djaru (Tsunoda 1981a: 122–123), Warrongo does not have a verb which functions
as a copula verb.

"The most outstanding feature of Warrongo syntax is syntactic ergativity, which
is largely created by the use of the antipassive construction (4.9). Word order is
fairly free, and Warrongo syntax is largely non-configurational (cf. Hale 1983).
But it is configurational to a very limited degree; see 4.5.2.2. Also, it is entirely
dependent-marking (cf. Nichols 1986). Warrongo discourse is highly elliptical.

"In all the examples at hand, the S of the -njirra clause and the S/A of the main
 clause are different. That is, it is possible, though by no means certain, that -njirra
functions as a ‘different subject’ marker. (This does not seem to apply to -nyo
 or -nji. Thus, -nyo has examples of the ‘same subject’ ((4-679) (S=[S]), (4-685)
 ([S]=S), and (4-688) (S=[A]), although the ‘subjects’ (S/A) are different in the other
 examples. The same is true of -nji. In (4-695) (S=[S]) and (4-697) (A=[A]), the
‘subjects’ are the same, although they are different in the other examples.)
Regarding (4-704) to (4-706), it is not relevant to determine whether they fit
 ergativity or not. They each contain no coreferential NPs.

(b-1) Contiguity of the constituents of a given construction.
