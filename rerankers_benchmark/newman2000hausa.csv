"8. WORD ORDER
The basic word order in sentences with i.o.’s is V + i.o.+ (d.o.),i.e., verb followedimmediately by the
sh. indirect object followed by the direct object (if present). This word order is the same whether the i.0.is a
noun or a pronoun, e.g.,
ura v3amigrate
Misa ya kawo [wa tsohuwa];9, ruwaMusa brought the old woman water.
",1.0,,[321],1,1,0.25,0
" ADN: In the Bauchi dialect, spoken in the far southeastern extent of the Hausa-speaking area, noun
 indirect objects (marked by wa or ma) occur after the d.o. (Gital 1987), e.g., Zainab ta kai abinci
 sequences. In many
 wa/ma Misa ‘Zainab took food to Musa’; Bala ya aika wasiKa wa/ma Ladi ‘Bala sent a letter to
 been a grade shift or
 Ladi’; Gambo ya yi tslwa wa/ma sarki ‘Gambo was rude to the emir.’ (Pronoun indirect objects
 interpretation of the
 occur immediately after the verb and before the direct object as in all other dialects.) This word order
 ive of the meaningis undoubtedly an innovation due to interference from Chadic languages in the region, where noun
 1.0. phrases typically occur after the d.o. (see Newman 1982). It is very unlikely that this represents
 a retention of an old Chadic word-order pattern.

[fara]y cé It’s white. (referring to some feminine object)
tsdgaggé]y néIt’s cracked . (referring to some masculine object)
3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

the
Some verbs allow double direct objects, e.g., Ex.
Gafba ya dauki Tankd mahaukaciGarba considers Tanko a fool.
 bai
Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

 The numeral d'aya ‘one’ can occur before the head noun (plus definite article), in which case it indicates
 ‘the other’, e.g.,
juantifiers even when
 daya yaron the other boy, cf. yaré dayaone boy; daya yarinyafthe other girl

to use the plural with
certain derived nounsWith prenominal adjectives, the word order is adj N + num, e.g.,

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

"Finally, I cannot begin to express the extent of my obligation to Dr. Philip Jaggar of the 
Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam
thank you and I indeed owe you one. Allah ya saka da alheri!
