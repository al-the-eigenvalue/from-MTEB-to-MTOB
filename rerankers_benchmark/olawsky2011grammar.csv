 18 Constituent order
Urarina constituent order represents a typological rarity that is found in very
few other languages. According to Tomlin (1986; cf. (934)), only five out of
402 selected languages exhibit the constituent order ""OVS"". However, in some
 languages, the order is split with respect to transitive vs. intransitive clauses.
For instance, subject-final order may only apply under certain conditions. I will
therefore adopt a terminology that describes Urarina as having OVA/VS order,
where A is the subject of a transitive clause and S the subject of an intransitive
clause.

Even for some languages listed as ""OVS"", this order is not entirely consistent.
Several Carib languages such as Bacairi (Wheatley 1973; DeAbreu 1895; von
den Steinen 1892), Apalai (Koehn 1974), or Arekuna (Armellada 1943; Koch-
Gruenberg 1924/1928; Edwards 1977) are subject to conflicting sources. Some
authors describe them as ""OVS"", but others as ""SOV"", which is partly related to
the Ergative system of these languages. Two other Carib languages that can be
convincingly characterised as OVA/VS are Hixkaryana (Derbyshire 1985) and
Trio (Carlin 2004). Interestingly, all of these languages belong to the Carib
family. For Urarina, the constituent order is consistently OVA/VS, with specific
deviations that are entirely predictable. This order applies to dependent and
independent clauses. In the independent (or ""main"") clause, constituents can be
focused. In this case they are shifted to the front and followed by a focus
marker. This is discussed in greater detail in §19. Furthermore, the structure of
all clauses is characterised by the following features:
- Subject and object are frequently omitted and understood by the context.
",3.0,OVS,"[671, 672]",5,1,1.0,1
" Most other modifiers have variable order.
- Adjectival or noun-like modifiers typically follow the head noun.
- Other modifiers can occur in prenominal or postnominal position, especially
 quantifiers.
- The typical or preferred order may be described as [DEM] - [POSSR] -
 [NUM] - [N] - [ADJ],
- Urarina does not have relative clauses, but these are substituted by various
 kinds of nominalisation that may occur with modifying function before or
 after the nominal head. Thus, grammatical categories such as tense and
 aspect are not expressed by these substitutes.
The constituent order within the dependent clause is largely identical to the
independent clause. Naturally, full NPs are even rarer in dependent clause, as
the referent of subject and object is usually mentioned in the main clause (if it is
mentioned at all). In the case of participle constructions and infinitives, the
subject is only expressed on the main verb. In subordinate clauses, the subjects
of dependent and independent clauses may be different (but they do not need to
be overtly expressed).
18.1 Transitive clause
From a typological point of view, there are six logically possible orders of
subject, verb, and object in a clause: AVO, AOV, VAO, VOA, OVA, and OAV.
Cross-linguistically, the first four types are relatively well attested, whereas the
last two types are hardly accounted for. Urarina represents one of these rare
types, since the unmarked word order is OVA. It has to be noted that, in a
language with extensive omission of overt NPs, the presence of arguments
realised as core NPs is not very frequent. However, OVA is the formally and
functionally unmarked constituent order, as is illustrated by the examples in
(936). A formal marking would involve a frontshift of the subject to the front, in
which case a focus enclitic must be attached to it. The examples are functionally
unmarked as they do not exhibit any pragmatic peculiarities in the context they
occur in. Note that in dependent clause, the presence of full NPs for both A an
Ο is rarer than it is in main clauses, which could be due to the fact that
dependent clauses mainly provide information that supplements information
given in the main clause, i.e. the participants are usually mentioned in the main

As was made clear through the table in (935), the omission of arguments is very
c o m m o n . In fact, subject and object are only present in 19% of all examples (S
in intransitive clauses; both A and Ο in transitive clauses), whereas in all other

known from the context. While it is not uncommon for S arguments to surface
as an NP in an independent clause, examples for the structure VA in
 independent clause (such as in (938b)) are rare. Pragmatically, this is a plausible
consequence of the fact that the subject is usually expressed in the main clause
or already known from the context. In (938c), strictly speaking, the verb of the
 independent clause (naa 'say (so)') is intransitive in terms of its morphological
features (cf. §9.5); however, it has a special status since it functions as a
quotative verb that is always preceded by direct speech in narratives (cf.
 §20.2.4.2).

In (939), the verb is represented by a copula with a copula complement. This
construction is similar to a transitive clause in that the copula complement
occurs in object position, i.e. in the same position as the Ο argument of a
transitive clause.

4.7.4Focus constructions
The basic constituent order of Urarina is OVA/VS, as the examples discussed so
far have illustrated. This order can be modified through the use of a focus
marker (=te, =ne, or =na), depending on the person of the subject (cf. §19). The
verb is obligatorily inflected with suffixes from the Ε-inflection type (discussed
in §11). While a wide range of different words or phrases can be shifted to the
front in this construction, I will discuss only noun fronting here. For this context
(207a), the following tonal patterns were observed:
- In examples with intransitive verbs, all nouns (here in clause-initial position,
 and followed by the focus marker) are L-toned.
- The focus marker (an enclitic attached to the end of the phrase that is in
 focus) receives a Η tone.
- The verb bears a final Η tone.
Note that in examples (207a,b,d), a subject is fronted, whereas the example in
(207c) exhibits an object followed by the focus marker. Thus, the tonal pattern
observed in these examples is not limited to subject fronting, but occurs with
any noun to which the focus marker is attached.

 In addition to the three most common types of tonal patterns on verbs, some
affixes can have specific effects on the tonal structure of verbs. One example for
this are the derivational suffix -hiohwa (and allomorphs, cf. §10.2.2), which
 itself carries a Η tone on the syllable /hi/ (or variant [si]), as shown in (199a).
Another is the intransitivising prefix ne-, which assigns a Η tone to the
penultimate syllable of most verbs, such as illustrated in (199b). When a long
vowel represents the final syllable, it is realised as a falling (HL) tone.
(199) Tone patterns resulting from derivational affixes
a) Medium degree suffix -hiohioa:
so.ma.hi.o.hwaa 'be almost white'
be.rau.e.si.o.hwaa'be green(ish)'
b) Intransitiviser ne-:
ne.hve.ra.ja'care for oneself
ne.rau.tää'get healthy'
ne.be.ta.kää'relax'
An aspect that needs further investigation regards the tonal structure of Type D
nouns when following a verb from Types 2 or 3. In this case, the pattern on the
noun changes, as exemplified in (200), where the Η tone on the noun is on the
penultimate syllable followed by a falling (HL) tone on the long final syllable.

4.7.2 VS and Ο VA constructions
As already indicated in the previous section, the tonal distribution ""One Η per
constituent"" is largely retained within a clause. This also applies to simple
sentences with the regular subject-final constituent order (VS or OVA; cf. §18),
where full nouns are present as arguments. In (201b), the object of the verb is a
Type A noun; thus, the verb gets its Η tone on the first syllable. Otherwise, the
Verb Phrase (VP) does not have other Η tones. Another Η tone is only found on

the subject 'man', which constitutes a separate syntactic phrase. As a general
principle, a subject NP always carries a Η tone on its own.

'Bartolome will not come.'
b) OVA order:
enejtguhoara-akatga
[monkey see-3ps/A] [man]
[VP][NP]
'The man saw the monkey.'
A different tonal structure applies when object and subject are syntactically
more complex than the examples above. In (202), the object consists of a
possessive construction with an adjective ('my small bag') and the subject is
composed of a noun and an adjective. In this case, the object NP as well as the
verb receive a Η tone. The subject NP bears a Η tone by rule, as predicted
above.

[lsgbagsmall][steaI-3ps/A] [manbad]

'The bad man stole my little bag.'
An interesting alternation is observed with possessive constructions that
function as an object in a transitive clause: recall that disyllabic nouns that
function as possessum receive a Η tone on their first syllable, as in kanu bihi
'my hand' (cf. §4.6.1). When this type of NP is followed by a transitive verb,
the Η tone shifts to the second syllable, while the verb remains toneless, as
illustrated in (203a). However, the shift only applies to possessed nouns that
have a light (V or CV) first syllable, whereas the possessive tone pattern
remains stable on possessed nouns with a heavy (VV or CVV) first syllable (cf.
(203b). For all other nouns in this position, no tonal changes from the
possessive pattern apply.

"A summary of their functions was given in (214). In addition, there are a few
subtypes of nouns that will be discussed in other sections of this chapter. These
include nouns with adjectival properties, personal pronouns, and demonstratives
(cf. §5.4 to §5.6).27 Note that interrogatives are not listed here as there is only
one underived interrogative (cf. §5.9). As stated in §7, nearly all noun types can
function as the head of a possessive NP (cf. (500)).
5.2 Verbs
Verbs can be subject to a large number of inflections. These include, person and
number, polarity, tense, aspect, mood and various kinds of modality/Aktionsart.
Valency-changing suffixes such as for passive and causative can be attached to
some verbs. Generally, verbs have three different forms of inflection for
person/number/polarity, depending on the clause type and/or the constituent
order (cf. §11). Another set of suffixes is used to cross-reference objects and
intransitive subjects under certain conditions. All grammatical categories are
realised as suffixes on the verb; the only productive prefix is the intransitiviser
ne- (cf. (240); §16.2).

 Reflex ivity 385
9.3Reflexivity
Urarina has no intrinsically reflexive verbs, but uses alternative strategies to
express reflexivity. Most importantly, there is a form that functions as a general
 intransitiviser. The prefix ne- is productively attached to transitive verbs in
order to create an intransitive verb. For instance, the transitive verb for 'lose' is
transformed into an intransitive verb 'get lost' by prefixation of ne-. The same
prefix is also used to mark reflexivity. A detailed discussion follows in §16.2.1
on valency changing mechanisms.
9.4Ambitransitivity
It is difficult to detect the existence of ambitransitive verbs in Urarina, as 3 rd
person objects are unmarked, i.e. if a transitive verb occurs without an overt
object, it automatically implies an (unmarked) 3 rd person object like 'it', 'him',
or 'them', which is only understandable through the context. One clue in order
to detect whether a verb is transitive or intransitive is the constituent order when
overt arguments such as subject or object are present. For instance, the verb
muhia 'burn' may occur with one or two overt arguments, as depicted in (569).
For both examples, the translation is unambiguous, but this is partly due to
pragmatic/semantic factors: it is obvious that the tree in (569b) does not play an
active role in the burning process. Therefore, with this ambitransitive verb,
there is an S/O relation in terms of argument structure.
(569)Verb tnukua 'burn'
a) Transitive use:
enua muku-anu
treeburn-lsg/A
Ί burned the tree.'
b) Intransitive use:
muku-a enua
burn-3ps/A tree
'The tree burned.'
Apart from the verb mukiia, no other ambitransitive verbs are known.

 670 Constituent order
 Given the special meaning and its rare occurrence in other texts, the 'turn into'
 construction with the copula can be regarded as idiomatic. As stated before,
variation of the basic constituent order such as illustrated in (956), which occurs
without formal or contextual marking, is extremely rare. In fact, only very few
examples of this type (including (956b)) are attested in the 799 clauses listed in
(940). Another rare example is displayed in (975a) further below, which
represents a syntactically rather complex sentence. It should also be noted that
there are no instances of order variation for the object of a transitive verb: It
always precedes the verb.

'If there was a topa tree in their field, they were sad ... [because they could not remove
it].'
In summary, the order of core arguments in dependent clauses does not differ
from that in independent clauses. However, there is a preference regarding the
position of non-core arguments in dependent clauses, as will become evident in
§18.4.
18.3Deviating order types
There are several conditions that can have an impact on the unmarked word
order: focus or emphasis, negative marking, and the involvement of the 'must'
construction. The most important factor is focus (also cf. §19): any constituent
of a clause can be focused; in this case, it is followed by a focus marker and
shifted to the front. Most commonly, non-core constituents such as adverbs or
discourse-related expressions (e.g. mi hau (lit. 'that+'because') to mean
'therefore') are marked for focus. A change in the basic constituent order only
applies when the subject of a transitive or intransitive clause is focused. Typical
contexts for focus involving deviating constituent order are content questions
and the frontshifting of subjects. As illustrated in (945a), the latter results in the
order AOV, since all other constituents remain unchanged. However, the scope
of focus sometimes involves more than a single constituent: In (945b), the
subject plus the adverbial expression nianatii 'even' are focused to mean 'even
the people from the other side of the Maranon River'.

Regarding the ""order"" of tone assignment in this context, the rules applying
to noun-adjective constructions are neutralised in favour of the possessive
construction.
4.7Sentences: More than one tone
In the previous sections it has been illustrated that on the basis of tonal classes
for nouns, syntactic phrases which involve a noun have a largely predictable
tonal structure. Most typically, there is one Η tone per constituent and its
position depends on the tonal class of the noun which precedes a verb,
adjective, or postposition. The verbs involved in verbal phrases analysed so far
were transitive. In §4.7.1, I will discuss different tonal types for verbs.
Comparable to the tonal structure of Type D nouns, there are some verbs that
appear to be lexically prespecified for tone, i.e. they deviate from the final-H
pattern. In §4.7.2, it will be shown that a clause with an overt noun subject
contains more than one tone. I then analyse the tonal peculiarities in a few
selected constructions such as clauses that involve adverbs (§4.7.3), focus
constructions (§4.7.4) and serial verbs (§4.7.5). There is a range of further
contexts that also exhibit special tone patterns, such as infinitive constructions,
subordinate clauses, participles, nominalisations, and sentences with introducer.
These involve a set of complex peculiarities, which will not be discussed here.
It should also be noted that, while certain principles can be identified, the
generalisations made here are tentative at the present stage.
4.7.1 Tonal patterns on verbs
Nearly all transitive verbs have a final Η tone when they are in isolation or
when they are followed by a subject noun. Note that a 3ps object of a clause is
usually not marked, i.e. a zero object is automatically understood as 3ps
pronominal referent. The examples in (196) show two transitive verbs with zero
objects; both are realised with a final Η tone, as is the subject. The tonal class of
the noun that functions as a subject does not play a role, since the tone
assignment rules apply from left to right, as observed in previous sections.

 Parallel to the examples given with the expression for 'also' and 'even', the
 fronted position of the subject in 'must'-constructions implies focus or
 emphasis, whereas the regular position does not imply this. Thus, nearly all
 instances of constituent order that deviate from the basic OVA/VS pattern can
 be explained by focus or emphasis, which is either formally marked or
 associated with particular constructions. However, there are a few isolated
 examples that exhibit subject-initial order without any formal marking and
without involving any of the expressions or constructions discussed above. Two
of these are given in (956). Example (956a) was later described as ""ugly but
 understandable"" by other speakers; the example in (956b) resembles a
construction that involves a copula complement, as is illustrated in (957).

going [i.e. they turned into water animals].'
 In order to account for the irregular order in (956b), one could assume that the
copula form ne-7, as found with the surrounding sentences in this context was
omitted for some reason: there is a special copula construction having the
meaning 'turn into'/'become', with intransitive function. As illustrated in (957),
the copula complement, (which occurs in the same position as the Ο argument
of a transitive verb), is followed by a participle form of the copula and a motion
verb for ' g o ' or 'walk' that bear the inflection. Literally, this combination could
be translated as 'it went being a (e.g. turtle)'. All examples occur in the same
context, where the speaker lists all the household items that turned into animals
during the flood. Interestingly, in four of the clauses (all listed in enumeration),
the subject appears in initial position, followed by the object, but both preceding
the verb. This is exceptional as similar structures are not found otherwise.
Another exceptional aspect of this construction is that it occurs without any
focus marker, which would normally appear when a subject is shifted to the
front.

Regarding the constituent order in sentences where many NPs surface, there
appears to be only one preference: an Ε argument or a recipient typically is in
the periphery, i.e. it does not commonly occur between verb and object or verb
and subject (for exceptions see §18.4). There is no restriction as to whether a
peripheral argument occurs before or after the verb. In (886), the Ε argument is
found in initial position, as it is marked with a focus marker. The focus marker
is not obligatory in order to have Ε in this position, as is shown by (882b) and
(883a), among others. Alternatively, the ke-phrase can also occur in postverbal
position (cf. (882a).

"In defining the typical properties of adjectives, several tests are commonly
used in order to distinguish an adjective class from other word classes. The
main point of distinction then is whether they are ""verb-like"" or ""noun-like"".
The following criteria help to identify them for one of the two groups. In order
to compare a potential adjective with a noun, the following checkpoints (listed
here as based on cross-linguistic tendencies) should be involved:
 1) Can the word function as a nominal head? - While this is obviously a typical
 property of a noun, it is not one of adjectives.
2) Can it function as a noun modifier? - This is a typical characteristic of an
 adjective, and in some languages also a feature of nouns. In Urarina, only a
 very limited group of nouns can function as such.
3) Can it function as a copula complement? Even though this is a property also
 associated with nouns, adjectives typically appear in this function.
4) Can the word take a noun plural? - This is another property that applies to
 nouns. In number agreement (which Urarina has only in part and as an
 optional feature within the NP) one may expect an adjective to be marked for
 number. In any case this would help to distinguish between noun-like and
 verb-like adjectives.
Properties that are typically assigned to verbs help to recognize whether a word
is verb-like or is an actual verb:
5) Can it take verbal suffixes?
6) Can the word be modified by an intensifier? 30
30
 The intensifier hatal is typically used with verbs but, as seen in the previous section,
it can also modify a noun in some cases. Therefore, this test is not ideal for the
 distinction between nouns and verbs.

The other nominalising suffix, -i, refers to the subject of an intransitive verb or
to the object of a transitive verb (cf. (229)). Again, the position of the
nominalised verb varies.
(229) Nominalised verbs with -i as noun modifier

In example (229c), -i refers to a verb object 'what (I) create(d)'. Note that
another nominalising suffix, -era, refers to an A argument and the verb will take
an object as in mi lenorie te-era ('that' 'food' 'give'-AG) 'the one who has given
that food'. In (230), a verb nominalised with -era functions as a modifier. It can
occur before or after the nominal head.

In addition to noun modification achieved through derivation, as discussed
above, there are some nouns that can modify another noun, but their use is
restricted and there are only a few (also see §6.5.4). In detail, only nouns that
specify membership in a specific group can function as modifiers. In particular,
this regards professions, or nouns whose semantic content coincides with

categories typically assigned to adjectives (but note that these concepts are not
expressed by adjectives in Urarina, cf. §5.4). There are only few nouns that can
function as a modifier of another noun and these cannot be freely combined
with any noun, as the following examples show: the noun enamanaa 'young
(man)' can modify the noun kat$a for 'man/person', but its use with ' w o m a n '
or 'peccary' is not possible. Note that enamanaa typically occurs by itself. The
order of such modifiers as enamanaa is not fixed, as it can occur in prenominal

It should be noted that these constructions are elicited and not very productive.
For instance, eene batiri 'a woman who is a priest' is not an acceptable
combination (though this may be based on semantic restrictions). Similarly the
modification of a noun through a noun that specifies tribal affiliation is
restricted: it is not possible with the tribal name for 'Cocama' (a neighbouring
group), while 'Urarina' is used as a modifier. Also the general term for 'Indio'
can function as a modifier.

A different type of noun that can modify another noun are nouns that specify
the category of a proper noun, such as place names. The order in these cases is
fixed for each modifier: with the modifier beetle, the proper noun occurs in first
position (cf. (234a)), but in the examples (234b,c), the proper noun is preceded
by the modifier.

Another noun that can be used as a modifier is the word for ' c h i e f (which is
also used for 'male'). In (235), it precedes the proper noun. According to
information gathered in elicitation, the order could also be reversed, but the
example would be ambiguous then: huliä kuraanaa could be understood as
'chief Julian' or as a possessive construction 'Julian's c h i e f .

With verbs that contain the habitual aspect marker -reheto (cf. §12.2.6), an
optional double occurrence of -uru is attested with a number of examples,
which is shown in (538). (Note that the 3pl/E form -kure is actually composed
of -uru and the person suffix -e, but written jointly for convenience.)
Alternatively, plural can be marked only once, in either position (before or after
the habitual suffix): ne-rehete-kure=lu or ne-ure-rehete=lu (cf. §12.2.12)

8.3Plural objects
Urarina has a suffix that marks plurality for the object of a transitive verb.
However, its use is restricted to certain conditions. A verb is obligatorily
marked with the suffix -naha under the following circumstances:
1. When the object is human and refers to 3pl, and
2. When the object does not surface as a noun or pronoun in the clause.
As shown in (539b), the plural suffixes for subject and object can occur in the
same verb.
",1.0,,"[379, 380]",1,14,0.7958020862324077,0
"Thus, it can be concluded that Urarina has a basic constituent order
OVA/VS, which can be subject to variation in nearly entirely predictable
environments, related to focus and emphasis.
18.4 Adjuncts
18.4.1 Position ofpostpositional phrases (PPs)
In §9.5 it was stated that there is no formal distinction between adjuncts and
arguments in addition to A/S and O. As was argued there, ""additional
arguments"" accompanied by ÄE, e.g. as a result of valency increase, may exhibit
minor semantic differences to adjuncts (also cf. §16.5). A similar situation is
implied for the postposition raj, which may indicate a recipient or beneficiary of
verbs of saying or giving. What all postpositional phrases (PPs) have in
common is that they are optional and entirely omittable, (which is the main
argument for suggesting the absence of ditransitive verbs in Urarina, cf. §9.5).
Another feature that is shared by all PPs is their position in a clause, which is
most typically in the periphery of the core clause. The most typical position for
any PP is before the main verb. In transitive clause with an overt Ο argument,
the PP occurs before O. There are almost no attested natural examples for their
occurrence between Ο and the verb. One is cited in (958), where the
postposition raj 'for' is cliticised with a possessive proclitic; the demonstrative
which functions as the object, in turn, is realised as a proclitic attached to itg,ej
'for you'. Due to the clitic status of the elements involved, it is questionable
whether this can be characterised as a PP-insertion between Ο and V. Since this
example is marginal at any rate, one could conclude that generally, PPs do not
occur in this position.

In the same way, the subject of an intransitive clause can be shifted to clause-

focus of a subject pronoun. In dependent clauses, focus markers do not occur.

frontshift of the subject (if required to indicate focus) occurs without a focus

 Accordingly, in a transitive clause, the constituent order can be AOV as a result
of negation, which is illustrated in (948). Again, the copula construction can be
compared to a transitive clause: in (948b), the copula occurs with a copula
complement and the subject is shifted to the front.

marker would do (also cf. §21). The difference is illustrated by the (elicited)

 Focus marking and clause types709
19.2.3Focus and dependent clauses
As mentioned in §18.3, focus in dependent clauses is not formally marked, but
indicated by constituent order only, i.e. a constituent may be fronted without the
attachment of a focus marker. Such behaviour, however, is extremely rare, as
the figures in table (942) (§18.1) indicate: only in 12 out of 354 dependent
clauses (equalling just over 3%), the subject was fronted - which is plausible
for two reasons. Firstly, there is a strong tendency for focus to be marked only
once per sentence. (Exceptions from this are discussed in §19.5.) Secondly, the
information given in a dependent clause usually is peripheral as compared to the
information given by the main clause. Prototypically, a dependent clause
comments on the action or event described in the main clause. It is common to
mark the entire dependent clause for focus, in order to convey the relevance of
the information for the main event. However, since the dependent clause is
treated like a single constituent in this case, it would be counterintuitive to
emphasise single elements within the dependent clause. The examples in (998)
illustrate the rare occurrence of SV constituent order in dependent clauses. For
(998a), it must be noted that focus is also marked through the presence of
-netomj 'also' - which is one of the exceptional expressions to predict order
variation (cf. §18.3). Note that in this example, the focused subject refers to the
main clause, as overt subjects with participle clauses are untypical. In (998b),
there is no overt marking for focus in the dependent clause. The quotation 'let
us see and do it' is embedded in the dependent clause for 'as one again said'.

 19.2.4Negative clauses
A further context in which focus markers do not occur is in negative clauses. As
mentioned in §18.3, focus is achieved by shifting the relevant constituent to
clause-initial position without using the focus marker. In (999), the subject is in
front position, but no focus marker is present. However, note that the verb is
obligatorily marked with the Ε-form, which otherwise co-occurs with the focus
marker.

'The young people from nowadays do not know it.' [About traditional naming]
The pragmatic functions related to the front position of the subject in this case
again are ambiguous, since both focus and topic functions are implied here. On
the one hand, the enclitic could refer to topic, since 'the young people' have not
been previously mentioned in this text and it is plausible that the speaker now
turns to their situation. On the other hand, 'the young people' are in contrast to
'the old people', whose customs were discussed in previous sentences.
Therefore, contrastive focus is also implied.

" All verb-like ""adjectives"" are derived; their behaviour is quite similar to that
of Stative verbs. Again, the main difference lies in their function as a modifier.
5.4.5 Sequences of noun modifiers
It is possible to combine several modifiers in a phrase, but this seems to be quite
rare in natural speech. All examples for such sequences are taken from the NT.
In addition, no particular pattern can be recognised that would postulate a
prescribed order of the different modifiers. The examples given below each
contain two adjectives, which are distributed around the noun in prenominal and
postnominal position, or both occur after the noun. It must also be noted that the
attested examples all involve deverbal adjectives, without any involvement of
adjectival nouns, which are not attested as sequences of modifiers. The first
example in (301) shows a sequence of stative verbs nominalised with /-i/. The
literal translation 'blackish red' is meant to describe a dark purple colour. The
second example illustrates the prenominal use of the nominalised form of 'be
white', followed by the noun, which in turn is followed by kanatga in
modifying function.

More frequent than a sequence of nominalised verbs is the chaining of verbs that
carry a participle suffix, i.e. these function as adverbials. This is not surprising, as
sequences of several participle constructions (representing clauses with different
types of transitivity) are very common in Urarina (cf. §20.3). In a similar way,

nominalised modifiers co-occur with participle forms, as example (302b) illustrates.
The order of nominalised verbs followed by a participle is not systematic, as other a
different order than the one observed below can occur with other examples.

Since sequences of modifiers do not seem to be common in the language, one
would not expect specific strategies for their ordering to be employed in the
translation of given sentences.
5.4.6 Comparison
As mentioned in the beginning of §5.4, Urarina does not have a morphological
comparative. However, there are a number of alternative strategies that allow a
comparison of qualities. Comparisons that imply superiority or inferiority
scarcely occur in the text database; thus, the majority of the examples given for
these is elicited. Comparisons that refer to equality are much more frequent,
which might imply that this concept is more significant than other types of
comparison, in terms of cultural values. Any kind of comparison is made
through derived forms of verbs such as 'exceed', 'be less', or 'be like'. The
table in (303) given an overview of the various comparative strategies. This
includes the reference to the type of parameter, i.e. the quality or content with
respect to which a comparison is drawn. While it is common from a cross-
linguistic perspective that the parameter is expressed by words referring to
quality (e.g. adjectives), this is not the case in Urarina. In most cases, the
parameter of comparison is expressed by a clause.

The words eku and atajbipaae are Chambira dialect variants of the Espejo
forms ku and tajbipaee.

Complement clauses generally precede the main clause, apart from very few
exceptions (cf. §23.3). Apart from that, constituent order is largely unaffected
by other clause types. The main difference is that content questions involve a
focused interrogative pronoun. Otherwise, questions have the same syntactic
structure as declaratives (cf. §21). Similarly, imperatives do not exhibit
syntactic peculiarities (cf. §15). Focus is discussed in greater detail in §19
In summary, Urarina has a constituent order that can be characterised as
pervasively OVA/VS, which is manifested both qualitatively and statistically as
the unmarked order in transitive and intransitive clauses, both as independent
and dependent, with affirmative as well as with negated verbs. The few cases in
which an alternative (AOV/SV) order is possible are confined to pragmatically
dependent contexts that involve focus or emphasis with subsequent fronting of
the subject. Adjuncts such as PPs and adverbs predominantly occur before the
verb, mostly in the periphery of the clause.

Passive 597
The examples in (860) have illustrated the use of the passive form in
combination with the auxiliary, through which the complex of verbal stem,
passive marker and cliticised auxiliary with inflectional suffixes seems to
function like any other verb. Note that many suffixes that potentially occur on
most verbs are not attested with the auxiliary attached to a passive form. It is
unclear whether this is the result of systematic exclusion or simply due to the
fact that this form is relatively rare. In fact, the most common use is with
person, negation, and tense markers, or with the participle marked on the
auxiliary. The latter is shown in (861), where the entire combination of
passivised verb and auxiliary represents a participle clause (cf. §20.3). In this
case, person and other grammatical features are expressed on the verb of the
main clause. (861a) illustrates third person marking (Ε-form) on the free copula
ne 'it is', while the passive form on 'buy' is followed by the copular auxiliary
marked with the participle suffix, literally meaning 'being bought'. A similar
example is given in (861b), where an inflected form o f ' r u n ' represents the main
verb, while 'being called' functions as a participle.

16.1.3 Argument structure
Another important question regards the role of the arguments within a passive
construction. Normally, a formal passive involves the decrease of verb valency
as its object (O) takes the function of the subject while the subject (A) is shifted
into the periphery of the clause (if surfacing at all). In Urarina, it is very

common for A not to be mentioned at all in a passivised clause. The subject of a
clause is marked on the verb, which is realised through person marking, while
NPs do not receive any formal marking, e.g. for case. Thus, the syntactic
functions of the involved arguments are expressed by constituent order (but note
that this order can be modified through the use of a focus marker).

"In a transitive clause, the tones on subject and focus marker behave in the
same way as in an intransitive clause. However, the object noun, which directly
precedes the verb, triggers the usual pattern on the verb, according to the tone
class of the noun.

"This preference becomes even clearer in dependent clauses. In fact, 91 % of
all dependent clauses that have an overt argument follow this rule, whereas only
9% (12 out of 128) exhibit deviating orders. Again, it is observed that ""V"" is the
most frequent clause type.

As mentioned above, the unmarked constituent order in intransitive clauses is
VS. This is illustrated in (943), where this structure is shown in independent

common in dependent clauses. The examples in (943) illustrate various types of

 intransitive verbs, such as active intransitive verbs (943a), stative verbs (943b),
and the use of an intransitive verb as the inflected verb in a serial v e r b
construction (cf. 943c)). T h e sentence in (943d) contains a copula, which, with

"Another word-related phenomenon observed in Urarina regards the
distribution of tones: every word (in isolation) tends to have exactly one Η tone.
When words are combined to syntactic constructions, different rules apply, but
this will be discussed in detail in the following section.
2.11Clitics
Clitics are relevant for the discussion of the phonology of a language as they
typically exhibit phonological peculiarities. At the same time their status is also
important for the grammatical structure of a word. More accurately, clitics
represent a special kind of unit for the distinction between ""word"" and ""affix"".
It is widely agreed that clitics are phonologically deficient from a typological
point of view. Typically, this means that a clitic does not bear prosodic features
such as stress or tone. The situation in Urarina, however, is not quite as simple
as that, since the numerous clitics found in the language can be distinguished
from each other by a range of features. The grammatical properties and
functions of clitics, and their relative order when attached to a verb, are
discussed in §12. Here I will analyse the status of the clitics listed in (97) as
elements that share properties otherwise assigned to words and affixes.
However, as will become clear, it is not possible to divide clitics into clear-cut
classes, as the features they share with each other or with affixes and words
overlap.

Involvement of other word classes as modifiers327
 The following table summarises the order of the different types of relative
 clauses with respect to the head of an Ν P. It becomes evident that the position
 of the relative clause before the head is more typical, while the occurrence of
 relative clauses in post-head position is comparatively rare or unattested for.
 Again, it is unknown whether the variation in position of a relative clause has
 any impact on the interpretation.

6.7Involvement of other word classes as modifiers
Adverbs can occur as modifiers within the NP, or, more precisely: they modify
a verb, which is then nominalised. In this context, adverbs precede the
relativised clause; demonstratives typically occur before the adverb. Note that
this is in contrast to their occurrence in clauses, where the position of most
adverbs is relatively free (cf. §18.4.2).
(496) Adverb ßoaelu in NP with relativised clause

The following examples show the presence of several adverbs in a relative
clause embedded in an NP. However, the order between a demonstrative and a
relative clause is fixed, as the demonstrative always occurs before the relative
clause, including any adverbs that modify the nominalised verb. In (497a,b), the
demonstrative precedes the locational adverb kau and the temporal adverb ena,

respectively. In (497c), there are two adverbs: kau occurs in initial position,

6.8 Summary
For several reasons it is not possible to represent the order of Urarina noun
modifiers in a hierarchical manner:
1. Some classes of modifiers are not homogeneous in that they contain some
members, which occur in one position, while others occur in a different
position.
2. Some classes of modifiers contain members that are variable and occur in
various positions.
The attested combinations of different kinds of elements within the N P are
summarised in (498), where for each modifier type, it is indicated whether it
occurs in prenominal or postnominal position and which other modifiers it can
precede or follow, respectively. Note that the relative order between modifying
nouns and relative clauses is unclear due to lack of examples.

 9.6.2Attribution
In §5.4 it was stated that Urarina has no homogeneous class of adjectives, but a
number of adjective-like words, with a range of properties that may differ from
word to word. One of the features mentioned was the possibility for a word to
occur as a copula complement (which does not apply to all adjective-like
words). However, some are indeed found as copula complements and again,
their position can be clause-initial (object position) or following a fronted
copula subject (cf. (583b)). Note that examples with the adjectival noun plus
focus marker are not attested, which could be due to the fact these mainly
function as modifiers.
(583)Adjectival noun as copula complement

b) With focus:
itQasuitea-naa=te baaso
[brother do-NOM=FOC] [bad][be:3ps/E]
[CS][CC] [V]
'What my brother does is bad.'
9.6.3Locative
The copula complement can also function as a locative, with or without
postposition. It is realised as a noun that refers to a location or as a locational
demonstrative (cf. §5.6.2). Since there is no specific marking for this function,
the difference between identity/equation and locative function only becomes
clear through context. For instance, the reading of (584a) as 'The snail is an
entrance' is ruled out by the context, or by general knowledge of logical
relations.

 One might expect that the peculiar constituent order of Urarina would also be
 subject to pressure from Spanish (a notorious A V O / S V language), but
 significant changes to constituent order in Urarina are not observed. As
mentioned in §18.3, there are a few isolated examples of an S or A argument
occurring in preverbal position that cannot be accounted for in terms of the
predicted features (focus, emphasis, negation). Beside that, in one of the dialects
 investigated further above (Copal), two examples with an Ο argument in
postverbal position were observed. While such examples are extremely rare,
one could of course attribute these to the influence of Spanish.

"A further suffix to appear on verbs is the infinitive marker -na, which is used

can be preceded by other suffixes (cf.(762)). Examples for this include the

 12.5 Discussion
Even though person is the only obligatory marking on verbs, the large number
of suffixes that can be combined (with a few theoretical exclusions) makes
Urarina a highly polysynthetic language. To give an overview, the order of
suffixes that were presented in §12.2 is summarised in (764). The table does not
include those suffixes that exclude person marking, as was discussed in §12.4. 61
It also indicates whether the order of the respective slots may vary or not.

 information is available as to determine its exact position.

 19 Focus
 In §18.3, it was highlighted that any variation to the regular constituent order is
 related to a frontshift of the subject or other constituents to mark focus. To
 clarify what is meant by ""focus"" in this grammar, some of the terms related to
this will be defined first.
As there is a lack of uniformity in terminology within the linguistic community,
there is considerable degree of disagreement among linguists regarding the
definition of ""focus"" and other categories of information structure such as
""topic"", ""theme"", ""rheme"", and ""new vs. given information"". Most authors
agree that the notion of focus and topic are related to the concept of old (or
given) information vs. new information. Old information may be characterised
as knowledge which is available to the listener at the time of utterance through
general knowledge or because it has been introduced before in the discourse. In
many languages, old information can be expressed through definiteness. New
information, in contrast, involves material that is added to the discourse for the
first time. In an oversimplified manner, topic is often characterised as ""what the
sentence is about"" whereas focus tend to be described as ""an element of a
sentence with particular prominence"". These definitions are brutal
generalisations of a concept that is too complex to be discussed in detail here.
Gundel & Fretheim (2005) distinguish between relational and referential topics
- the former referring to the theme of an utterance (which is complemented by
relational or information focus as representing the new information about the
topic), the latter as referring to topic as the current centre of attention. In a
similar way, Gundel & Fretheim distinguish between two major types of focus -
the type just mentioned (information focus) and contrastive focus, understood as
""material which the speaker calls to the addressee's attention, thereby often
evoking a contrast with other entities that might fill the same position."" Both
types of focus ""may be syntactically coded by placing the relevant constituent
in a syntactically prominent position"" (cf. Gundel & Fretheim 2005:6). Other
languages may express such prominence prosodically, e.g. by intonation. In
fact, both topic and focus are typically represented by some formal marking,
which may be of syntactic, morphological, or phonological nature.

(haanu,-naha\cf. §20.2.4.1), is evident in that only kujßa introduces a
subordinate clause, it is not clear-cut what could be the semantic differences.
Note that the translation 'in order to' is not meant to imply a same subject
construction (as in English), but that the subjects of dependent and main clause
can be different.
(374) Use of kujßa
a)
mihäu=tetururi molo-ore ruku-uru-a=nekujßa
that because=FOC llanchama.Xree cut-3pl/E pull.out-PL-3ps/D=SUBso.that
'Therefore, they cut the llanchama tree in order to pull her out.'
b)
satonohei=te ikito-oama-urehoitQa-kuru-a doktoro-kuru=ne kujßa
in.the.end=FOC PLN-LOC take-3pl/E heal-PL-3ps/D doctor-PL=SUB so.that
'In the end, they brought him to Iquitos so that the doctors (would) cure him.
huataa'so that not', 'lest'
hoataa (and its variant kauatia\ occurring only in the traditional language) is
the negative equivalent of kujßa. Accordingly, the subordinate clause can have
a different subject than the main clause. Generally, the fact that the subordinate
marker already implies negation leaves the dependent verb in the affirmative
mood. When the subordinate clause is in initial position, it can be emphasised
by the introducer nabana, as shown in (375c).
(375) Use of hoataa
a)
itga-u eno-aakau=nehuataa
do-IMP enter-3ps/Dwater=SUB so.that.not
'Do it so that the water (would) not enter!'
b)
anofwa dada-a kanu beree=ne hoataaajto-o
knifetouch-3ps/Dlsg child=SUB so.that.not say-lsg/E
Ί said it so that my child would not touch the knife.'

 Deviating order types 663
(948) Constituent order in negated clause: subject-initial position (AOV)
a) With full verb:
ena tie-nakauru katQa-urußäertijihasisi
[now be-those.who man-PL] [already] [not.at.all] [mixture]
 [A][ADV][ADV][Ο]
huituku-uru-i
[know-PL-NEG:3ps/A]
 [V]
'Those who live now do not at all know the mixture [for making blowgun poison].'
b) With copula:
kivatiakann i=tgene letono ni-a-u=ta
not[lsg][2sg=place envoy] [be-NEG-1 sg/E=FRS]
[INTR] [CS][CC] [V]
Ί am not the envoy for your place!'
The function of this order variation clearly relates to focus and emphasis,
(which may coincide in Urarina, depending on the context). This becomes
especially clear in example (948b), where Adam, who is the only human left in
the world, warmly welcomes one of two women who suddenly appear. In
protest, she makes it very clear that he is embracing the wrong one: the pronoun
for lsg, which is in initial position, is in focus to mean 'it is not me (but the
other one)'. As negative clauses do not occur with focus markers, the move is
made without formal marking.

It is observed that the variability with regard to the position to each other
mainly concerns word types with a high lexical load, i.e. adjectives, modifying
nouns, and nominalised verbs. These types, which happen to relate to noun-like
categories, typically occur adjacent to the head noun, but have a comparatively
free order amongst each other. In contrast, demonstratives, which have a more
functional use, have a relatively fixed position in the NP and need not occur in
adjacency to the noun. Numerals, which also are less noun-like than other
modifiers, are fixed in their position in that they precede the head noun;
however, their position with regard to other modifiers is comparatively free.
Quantifiers, (which are not a separate underived word class, cf. §5.11), exhibit
the most diverse order pattern as they do not constitute a homogeneous group.

 832 Questions
(1158) Interrogative =na after verb
a)
hanone mesaheauna-i=pa
morning message hear-2ps=INT
'Did you hear the message in the morning?'
b)
mi kujßa kana ra-a kana+huaaun-era=ne hau koituku-akat<?e=na
that so.that lpl/in receive-3ps/D our.creator=SUB because know-lpl/in=INT
'Do we [all] know that God has accepted us for that [purpose]?'
A verb to which =na is cliticised does not necessarily occur in clause-final
position. The order verb - interrogative clitic is also preserved when a subject
noun follows the verb, such as in (1159a), where the intransitive verb 'come',
followed by =na, occurs before the S argument 'rain'. In (1159b), the verb is
followed by the adverb 'tomorrow'.
(1159) =na after verb with VS order
a)
u-ri-tQa=i=β a elo
come-IRR-3ps/A=ASS=INT rain
'Will it rain?'
b)
turu-ri-tQa=i=β aeresi
arrive-IRR-3ps/A=ASS=INT tomorrow
'Will he arrive tomorrow?'
When a constituent is in focus (in terms of the general emphatic function of
focus as discussed in §19), it is marked with the interrogative enclitic; focus
markers cannot occur in polar questions. Thus, example (1159b) could also be
realised as eresi=ßa tururit$äi, in order to put emphasis on the adverb ('Is it
tomorrow that he will arrive?'). Further examples are given in (1160). In
(1160a), the adverb 'really' is marked with =na; in (1160b), the enclitic follows
a conditional subordinate clause. Example (1160c) is elicited, as it is uncommon
to mark an Ο argument for emphasis in a polar question. Thus, the sentence
implies contrastive focus on 'monkey', such as to inquire whether the addressee
has this particular preference, as opposed to other food mentioned before in
discourse.

While details will be discussed further below, the following factors become
evident at first sight:
1. Clauses without any overt argument are extremely common. These make up
much over half of all examples.
2. Where arguments are present, most clauses follow the basic constituent order
OVA/VS. Their frequency is five times higher than the deviating order types
(35% vs. 7%).
3. There is a minority of clauses that exhibit a different order.

"One construction is with the expression for 'also', -netonaj, a form that was
already discussed in §5.3.6. There are several examples where -netormj follows
a subject in initial position. Apparently, it can take the function of a focus
marker, as is illustrated in (950): In all examples, the use of 'also' puts the noun
to which it is attached in focus, as to point at the involvement of that particular
participant in addition to others. While examples (950a,b) involve intransitive
clauses, (950c) exemplifies the use of -netonaj with the transitive verb 'catch'
(here without an overt object).

330 Noun Phrase structure
3. Demonstratives tend to occur at the left edge of an NP; their position is
 relatively fixed. Only quantifiers can precede demonstratives.
4. While numerals occur before the head noun, they follow demonstratives and
 possessives. Thus, for those types of modifiers that obligatorily precede the
 noun, there is a preferred order: DEM + POSSR + NUM + N.
5. Adjectives, nominalisations (with relative clause function), and other noun-
 like modifiers typically occur close to the head of the NP. At least some
 members of these three modifier types can occur in prenominal or
 postnominal position, but most adjectives occur after the noun, while most
 relative clauses occur before the noun.
6. Adjectives precede other noun-like modifiers and relative clauses. However,
 a preferred order between the three noun-like modifiers is difficult to draw,
 as these groups are heterogeneous.

"Urarina has two predominant plural suffixes. One is -t$e, which occurs with
verbs only; the other is -uru. The latter functions as a noun plural marker, but it
is found in a number of other contexts as well. For instance, it also functions as
a pluraliser in verbal marking for 3ps. Other suffixes referring to number are the
plural object marker -naha for transitive verbs, the distributive suffix -ahua,
and the plural marker -ana for stative verbs.

-uru 3ps subject (transitive and active intransitive verbs)
-ana 3ps subject (stative intransitive verbs)

356 Number marking
This chapter will analyse the use of these suffixes in detail. One thing that all
plural markers have in common is the tendency to be optional. While plural
marking on nouns or as an instance of morphological agreement on verbs may
be the more frequent option, it is not uncommon to use the singular form if
plurality is implied by the context. In relation to this, the correlation between
number and humanness will be examined (cf. §8.7).

 654 Constituent order
The word order within the Noun Phrase is discussed in §6. As suggested, not all
kinds of modifiers have a fixed position in the NP, but certain tendencies and
preferences can be summarised as follows:
- Demonstratives, numerals, and possessors always precede the nominal head.

The pronoun for lsg has a variant kiitQa that occurs in nominaliser
constructions with the suffix -i (cf. §6.6.1). In this construction, where the noun
derived from a transitive verb represents the relativised object of the clause, the
subject typically is marked with the suffix -at$a 'only', which results in
kanu-atga when it occurs with the lsg pronoun. Alternatively, the two
components can fuse and are realised as kiitQa, with no apparent semantic
difference. All other pronouns are regularly joined with -at$a in this context
without any alternation.

In addition to the free pronouns, Urarina has proclitics for the singular, which
are derived from the full forms (except for 3sg). These can be attached to nouns
and verbs. With verbs, they function as object proclitics; with nouns, they refer
to possessive pronouns (cf. §7.1.3). However, procliticisation mainly functions
as a feature of the traditional language; younger people prefer the use of free
pronouns rather than procliticisation. This applies to both personal and
possessive pronouns.
(318) Proclitics
lsgka=
 2sg i=
 3sg n=, (ne=, ni=)
In particular, the use of the 3sg proclitic has been reduced even among older
speakers. While ka= and i= (or allomorph d$= for 2sg before vowel-initial
roots) are still common practice, the proclitic 11= is only observed with vowel-
initial roots. Before consonant-initial roots (319b), the use of the 3sg allomorphs
m = or m= is very rare: the two examples with these 3ps forms listed below
were rejected as ungrammatical even by an older speaker, even though these
forms occurred in a text by another speaker of the traditional variety of Urarina.
It is also obvious that the use of possessive proclitics is related to the matter of

inalienable possession; this is discussed in §7.4. S o m e examples for the use of
proclitics in possessive function are illustrated below:
(319) Use of proclitics in possessive function
a) lsg and 2sg forms:
ka=hitQana'my blowgun'
ka=ripaha 'my grandfather'
i=hitg,ana'your blowgun'
i=tQuerehe-uru'your children'
b) 3sg forms:
n=asi 'his nose'
n=uhoana'his field'
?m=hitQana'his blowgun'
?ne=batohwi 'their arrows'
For proclitics that occur with object function, only the f o r m s for l s g and 2sg are
attested, while the 3sg form is not observed. T h e reason for its absence as an
object proclitic could be that 3 rd person object pronouns do not surface in
general, but are implied through omission. While it is not ungrammatical to use
them as arguments of a transitive verb, they almost never occur in this context.
T h e m e a n i n g of ' h i m ' or ' t h e m ' is mutually understood f r o m the context of an
utterance. However, all three proclitics occur in combination with postpositions,
as shown in (320c-e).
(320) Object proclitics
a) lsg object proclitic with verb:

'for you'
e) 3ps object proclitic with postpositions tgoae, asae:
m=tQoaen=asae
3sg=on 3sg=in/under
'on top of it' 'under it'
The prefix found on intransitivised verbs, ne- (and variants), which may also
have reflexive function to some degree, possibly is a remnant of the 3sg object
proclitic, as the reflexive subject in this construction is identical to the object
argument. However, this prefix exhibits an allomorphy different from the one
found with proclitics (cf. §16.2).
5.6Demonstratives
The Urarina deictic system distinguishes three degrees of spatial reference, each
of them involving the position of the participants:
kaa 'this' (close to the speaker)
mi'that' (close to the listener)
taa 'that over there' (distant from both participants)
Regarding this type of distinction, one could also relate the three demonstratives
with first, second, and third person, respectively, kaa even has some degree of
phonological similarity, if compared with kanu ( T ) . The similarity between nii
and ii ( ' y o u ' ) is more subtle (different onset), taa and aka ('he/she/it') have
even less in common. However, the use of the demonstratives suggests that kaa
refers to something with regard to first person, nii to second person and so on.
Evidence for this is not only provided by the phonological similarities, but also
through the deictic function of the demonstratives. The correlation between first
person and demonstrative kaa is manifested by the fact that kaa relates to an
item in the space close to the speaker; similarly nii refers to something close to
the listener, implying a relation to second person. Correspondingly, taa refers to
something not close to either the speaker or the listener - thus, implying a third
person.

646 Serial verb constructions
 subordinate clause with the purposive/consecutive conjunction kujßa; although
this version may reflect minor (unspecified) semantic differences to a SVC, it
was recommended as ""almost identical"" by the consultant. (929b) represents a
 SVC of the regular type, as is described in this chapter. In example (929c),
however, the order of the verbs is inverted, which also includes the object of
"" V I "" (which now has become V2). Note that the morphological marking on
relaa 'teach' is identical to the one in a regular SVC - the neutral form.
(929) Order variation with imperative
a) With conjunction:
u-u kat^a-ururela-i=jie kujßa
come-IMP man-PL teach-2ps=SUBso.that
'Come to teach the people!'
b) Regular SVC:
katga-ururela-au-u
man-PL teach-NTR come-IMP
'Come to teach the people!'
c) Order variation:
u-ukatQa-uru rela-a
come-IMP man-PL teach-NTR
'Come to teach the people!'
While the exact conditions for this kind of inversion are not entirely clear, it
seems that the purposive aspect of it plays a central role. The variation is also
possible in declarative sentences such as Ί went to fish' or 'he went to build his
house', but it is not acceptable with other semantic types, e.g. such examples
with a mainly resultative or aspectual meaning.
17.4.4Number of verbs involved in SVCs
Usually, each SVC consists of not more than two verbs, with one exception:
when the verb nuhija 'do in vain' is involved, three verbs can occur in
sequence. In this case, the first two verbs are each marked with the neutral
suffix, while mikuja receives all inflectional markers. Examples are given in
(930); however, it must be noted that these constructions are comparatively rare
and thus do not allow an in-depth study.

11 Person inflection classes
Each Urarina verb can occur with up to three different verb forms in the
grammatical categories of person and polarity marking (and, partly, irrealis). I
distinguish these forms in the following way:
- D-form: occurring in finite dependent clauses only
- Α-form: 3sg is -a
- Ε-form: 3sg is -e
While one may feel tempted to describe these types as ""conjugation"", this term
could be easily misinterpreted. The phenomenon that is known from other
languages, such as the Romance languages, is fundamentally different from
Urarina in that in a language such as Italian, the class of verbs is divided into
subclasses that each take a specific set of inflectional markers. In Urarina, the
distinction is not inherent to the verb, but depends on the grammatical context
in which a verb occurs. That is, every verb can be inflected for any of the three
types if it occurs in the respective context. Similar phenomena are known from
a few other languages only. For example, some Arawak languages such as Bare,
Warekena, and Baniwa mark a focussed subject by a special cross-referencing
prefix in addition to other inflectional categories (cf. Aikhenvald 1995: 152). In
the Chadic languages Hdi, Lele and Mina, there is a morphological distinction
between ""pragmatically independent clauses"" and ""pragmatically dependent
clauses (cf. Frajzyngier 2004). Different paradigms for person marking are also
reported for Menya (Trans New Guinea Phylum; cf. Whitehead 1987: 41) and a
few other Highlands languages of that area. Menya has two sets of subject
cross-reference markers the choice of which depends on the division into final
and medial verbs. However, a threefold distinction into different paradigms, as
found in Urarina may be considered unique.

6 Noun Phrase structure
The order of elements within the Urarina Noun Phrase (NP) is variable to a
certain degree. Speaking in a simplified manner, all kinds of modifiers can
occur in prenominal position, with some peculiarities, which are discussed in
this chapter. In principle, a division into two groups can be made: modifiers that
can also follow the noun and those that cannot, or, expressed in a different way:
modifiers with a fixed position within the N P and modifiers that exhibit a
certain degree of variation regarding their position. The ""restricted"" group of
words, which obligatorily occur in prenominal position, consists of
demonstratives, possessives, and numerals. 38 Adjectives, nominalised verbs,
quantifiers, and special modifying nouns can occur before or after the noun, the
details of which will be investigated in §6.1 to §6.5. In §6.6,1 will also discuss
the position and structure of relative constructions, which are realised as
nominalisations and are therefore part of the NP.

 Spanish. The speaker is not used to telling stories. Text 7 is a hunting story
(personal experience) and text 13 an account of the village history. Text 16 is a
traditional narrative told by an older speaker, a trained storyteller. Texts 12 and
23A are both presented by a younger speaker with little experience in story
telling. They are narratives that describe dangerous situations experienced by
others (not the speaker himself). Text 35A is by the same speaker and is a
picture description as a given task. It is evident from the statistics that this type
of genre differs significantly from the others: the frequency of clauses with
deviational order types in this text equals the number of examples with regular
order. However, this can easily be accounted for by the fact that the speaker
shifts the subject into focus in many examples as he describes the given images.
Text 34 is a natural conversation between two speakers via a shortwave radio.
Overall, not taking into account clauses without an overt argument (""V""), 76%
(159 out of 210) of order in the main clause correspond to the regular OVA/VS
scheme, whereas 24% deviate from that.

(284) Words for 'big' in Urarina31

Artefacts: 'canoe' ('house') 'boat', 'canoe'
Abstract nouns:'suffering' — (unattested)
 'darkness'(unattested)(unattested)
Regarding the actual size of the modified object, consultation with different
speakers lead to inconclusive characterisations between the three words. While
with most speakers, tabaj appears to refer to a larger size than the other two
words, the size distinction of tasißohwaj and seohwa is not drawn consistently.
A more obvious distinction is of a syntactic nature. While tasijiohwaj can occur
as a noun modifier, it is less common in this function. The main and preferred
use of tasiflohwaa is as a verb. When it is used as a modifier, it evidently tends
to refer to a process 'having become big' with some nouns, e.g. with humans
and animals. A further restriction to tasißohwaa is that is does not occur with
abstract nouns. In contrast, the verb tabaa tends not to be used with some
human terms, such as 'woman', while its use as a modifier for 'woman' is
possible. In summary, the semantic distinction between the different words for
'big' remains challenging.

"While the high degree of order variation makes it almost impossible to state
the ""unmarked"" order of modifiers within the NP, it can be said that most
typically, all modifiers except adjectives precede the head noun, with
demonstratives and quantifiers preferably occurring before other modifiers. The
variable order of constituents within the NP is only partly predictable, such as
with some adjectival modifiers (cf. §6.5); otherwise, it is unclear whether order
variation has any semantic or pragmatic effects. It must be noted that
syntactically complex NPs (involving two or more modifiers) do not very
commonly occur in the database. Since the N T translation contains a much
wider range of examples for complex NPs, many of the cases illustrated in this
chapter are adopted from there. However, the lack of natural examples results
into a number of questions that cannot be answered, i.e. it is impossible to
predict all possible and impossible combinations for each and all nominal
modifier. Another issue is the ambiguity of some examples with regard to the
scope of some modifiers. As a general tendency, the rightmost modifier has
scope over the head of N P and any further modifiers that precede it have scope
over that constituent (right-branched bracketing). However, in some cases,
which all involve quantifiers, the scope of the quantifier can differ from that.
With some lengthy examples from the NT, the scope may be ambiguous. The
following sections discuss the details of the common occurrence of different
38
 Numerals may be regarded a subtype of quantifiers, but since they exhibit a different
 syntactic behaviour than other quantifiers, they are discussed separately. Also see the
 structural differences between quantifiers and numerals as discussed in §5.
