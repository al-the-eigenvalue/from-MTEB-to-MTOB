"The prototypical use of the term ‘basic word order’ is
 to refer to arrangements of subject, object, and verb in clauses, and, in these terms, there
 are six basic word order types theoretically possible: SOV, SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS, and
 OSV, listed here in the order of how common each type is among the world’s languages,
 although the last two types, OVS, and OSV are so rare that it is not yet clear whether there

" Alsea, Siuslaw, and Coos have been tentatively categorized as having VOS as their
 basic word order, by Greenberg (1966), on the basis of the fact that Greenberg found VOS
 to be the most common order of subject, object, and verb in these languages.",2.2,,[519],3,2,0.6,0
"It is well recognized, however, that word order in many languages can be largely a
matter of Discourse Pragmatics, or what might be called information packaging, which is
independent of constituent structure, so that the basic word order type of a language is only
the most common arrangement of these clause constituents, or for some languages, not
even a common order, but just the least mark order of these constituents in discourse
pragmatic terms. For some languages, word order is evidently entirely a matter of Dis-
course Pragmatics and for such languages there is apparently no basic word order, since
each possible arrangement of subject, object, and verb in a clause is marked in discourse
pragmatic terms, and has a specific discourse pragmatic function. This has been argued to
 be the case for Hanis Coos, and a number of other languages, by Mithun (1984). Research
 by the present author on Miluk Coos indicates that this is also equally true for Miluk. In
 these two Coos languages, there are VOS, VSO, SVO, SOV, OVS, and OSV clauses. The
 occurrence of each order can be explained by discourse pragmatic principles, without ac-
 tually resorting to the notion that the language has a basic word order.
",2.2,,[519],3,3,0.6,0
"At the other
 extreme, there are languages like the Coos languages which evidently use word order
 exclusively for discourse pragmatic purposes, rather than to identify the syntactic categories
 of sentence constituents. Because of this, the notion that these languages have a basic
 word order may not be applicable. Kutenai seem to be like the Salishan languages in
 having some use of word order, as a device to code information about syntactic structure,
 although word order primarily codes discourse pragmatic information.

" It can be argued that the order VOS is more of a neutral order in discourse pragmatic
terms in Kutenai than other orders. It is certainly more common than the other orders, but
VOS, VSO, and SVO clauses are all rare in unelicited narratives and the other orders: SOV,
OSV, and OVS are marginal, even in elicited examples obtained from English speaking
bilingual speakers of Kutenai. It is apparently the case that any Kutenai clause containing
both a lexical subject and a lexical object is already so highly marked in discourse pragmatic
terms, that there is no ordering of lexical subject with lexical object which qualifies as a
neutral order, or even as a least marked order, in discourse pragmatic terms.

 common than the order VOS, and VSO is even less likely than VOS to qualify as a neutral
 order in discourse pragmatic terms. The order SVO is somewhat less common in narra-
 tives than VOS or VSO, although in elicited data where English sentences are the models
for the Kutenai sentences, the order SVO is fairly common, following the influence of
English word order.

discourse pragmatic considerations may override this and a nominal phrase representing a
newly introduced subject in a text may precede the verbal phrase. Discourse pragmatic
principles do not evidently have free reign to put a nominal phrases representing a direct
object or indirect object before the verbal phrase, although there are rare examples. It
would appear that, for Kutenai, the most neutral order, in discourse pragmatic terms, is

that they have badges’. It is also a lexical item meaning ‘policeman’. In morphological

The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument

One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.

 least marked order in discourse pragmatic terms is for the verbal stem whether indicative,
 interrogative, or relative to precede the nominal stem. In all three constructions, the nomi-
 nal stem is coreferent to, and in apposition to, the actual subject of the verbal stem, which
 is a third person zero affix on the verbal stem. !*
4.1 Kutenai Word Order404
The following text examples, from the Constable Pritchard Text, contain constructions
functionally similar to the one in WO.15, part (c), above,where a relative clause type k-
form precedes and ostensibly modifies a nominal stem. The clause in WO.16, part (d) is of
a relative clause type k-form preceding and ostensibly modifying a lexicalized k-form. A
literal meaning of the second k-form, at one level of analysis, is ‘that he/she/it has a badge,
that they have badges’. It is also a lexical item meaning ‘policeman’.",3.0,VOS,"[722, 723]",5,43,0.8385243680160515,1
"In Kutenai, the most commonly occurring personal pronouns are affixal or clitic pro-
 nouns and they are constituents of verbal phrases, rather than nominal phrases which could
 be freely ordered either before or after a verbal phrase. There is one notable case of vari-
 able order of clitic pronouns within Kutenai verbal phrases. In second person singular
 subject imperative verbal forms, the First Person Clitic Pronoun /hU./ and the Second
 Person Clitic Pronoun /hin./ occur encliticized onto verbal stems. When they occur
 together encliticized onto the same verbal stem, they are in the order VOS, i.e. Verbal Stem

" The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.

 In nominal phrases in Kutenai where deictic words, the quantitative word /api?/, or
the determiner /ni ?/ ‘the’ precede a nominal stem, ostensibly modifying it, it is possible
 to see the ostensible modifier as fundamentally or alternatively a pronoun, and therefore
 fundamentally a nominal stem in its own right. The modifying word is also a proclitic
 element on the following word and a part of the same nominal phrase. If nominal stems are
 subordinate predications, as is assumed here, then the deictic words, the quantitative

/ api ?/, and the determiner /ni ?/ ‘the’ are each specialized kinds of predications. The
comparability of the various constructions in Kutenai where one word or phrase modifies a
following word or phrase and the further comparability of these constructions to Verbal
Stem-Lexical Subject construction seen above in WO.15 makes it questionable that the
Dependent-Head word orders represented by the ostensibly modifying constructions are
very fundamental or old in the language. It may be that in diachronic terms the Dependent-
Head constructions are derivative of a basic Head-Dependent order.

pronominal object marking, these forms are given an analysis where zero morphemes are
posited in the analyzed forms. The arrangement of the zero suffixes here follows a pattern
whereby the Subsidiary Third Person (Subject) Suffix /-$/~/iS/ follows the overt pro-
nominal object suffixes it co-occurs with. This makes for an order of Verb-Object-Subject.
There is evidence for VOS as the language's basic word order.! 7

"One possibility explored by Dryer is that the ending /-apS/ is a single morpheme and
that the forms with it are genuinely passive, where the patient has become a syntactic sub-
ject. Although the sentences here are elicited, which introduces the influence of English
 word order, at least to a small extent, these examples are interesting for the study of Kute-
 nai word order in that, in examples HRO.4 and HRO.5, lexical arguments representing
 patients actually occur preverbally in sentences which were accepted as grammatical by a
 Kutenai elder. The same elder, on an earlier occasion’orking with the author, questioned
 the grammaticality of OSV word orders in sentences which could only be translated as
 active sentences in English. In that session, direct elicitation based on English sentences
 was avoided, but, of course, OVS sentences are not grammatical in any event in English,
 although Patient-Verb-Agent sentences are grammatical in English, but only when they are
 passive.

" For the most part, Kutenai word order is a matter of discourse pragmatics at the sen-
tence level (i.e. the arrangement of clauses within sentences), and it is also largely a matter
of discourse pragmatics at the clause level (i.e. the arrangement of phrases within clauses).
In contrast, Kutenai word order at the phrase level (i.e. the arrangement of words within
phrases) is relatively fixed. At the phrase level, word order in Kutenai is almost entirely a
matter of the requirements syntactic structure, rather than any choices offered by discourse
pragmatics. Moreover, even phrases in Kutenai which consist of several words generally
 sound like a single long word, at least judging the matter from the standpoint of English.
Words within Kutenai phrasesare strung together with cliticization boundaries, making
 Kutenai phrasal syntax very much like word morphology.
