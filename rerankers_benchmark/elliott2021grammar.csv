"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

"Pragmatically based word order (cf. Mithun 1992), is a cover term for languages like
Enxet Sur in which 1) the relative order of s-argument NPs to one another and to the
verb is not determined by or indicative of their semantic role, and 2) the relative order of
elements in a sentence is instead determined by pragmatic factors which include expect-
edness, information structure, and newsworthiness. Generally speaking, most languages
which are claimed to have a “free word order” are likely to have a pragmatically based
word order instead, and word order is governed exclusively by information structure
as opposed to being governed primarily by clausal syntax. Again, as a predicate-initial
or verb-initial language, Enxet Sur does not have an entirely pragmatically based word
order. Instead, it is the order of nominal expressions after a verbal predicate which is
“pragmatically based”.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",3.0,No dominant order,"[314, 315]",5,3,1.0,1
"Furthermore, word order has to be considered within a perspective where some if
not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:

"The latter of Powys’ statements is a good point of departure for describing basic word
order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

 This strict VAO ordering may be used in these de-contextualized instances of equal-

it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-
biguation is necessary. However, there is little descriptive value — I’d argue none — in
calling Enxet Sur a “VAO/VSO language”.

"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

" However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,

" Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

"In terms of both the topic-comment structure and the given-new structure, Enxet Sur,
somewhat unsurprisingly, shows comment-topic and new-given as unmarked, typical or-
ders. Several verb-initial or predicate initial languages, some rather well-studied, have
been described as having a comment-topic order as the unmarked information structure

" When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

"Enxet Sur is a predicate-initial language with an otherwise pragmatically determined
word order. Nominal predicates play an important role in the basic grammar of the lan-
guage, as nominal expressions which reference the semantic arguments of verbs are of-
ten realized syntactically as the nominal predicates of independent clauses, instead of
as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet
Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.

"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in

In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

" Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

" This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

" Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 ‘Your child has no parasites?’ (literally ‘There are no parasites in your child’s in-
sides?’)
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

ag-máha

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

" Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 ‘He put mud on my eyes’
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,

which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are

Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

" An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

" In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.

It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-

Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

" The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
