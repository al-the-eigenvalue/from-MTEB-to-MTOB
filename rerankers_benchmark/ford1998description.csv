 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many

 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are

"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'

 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

" Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:

 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).

 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to

" Enuni and Patjtjamalh (see Ford, 1990) do not appear to be in any
way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the

peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked

" On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

"Chapter Two describes the segmental phonology of the language. It
provides evidence for the existence of a voicing contrast between stops and the
existence of two phonemic :fricatives. It shows how the stress patterns of
complex morphemes which have been subsumed into the verb reveal that they
were once independent words.
