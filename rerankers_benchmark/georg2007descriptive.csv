"190A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
In order to avoid misunderstandings about alignment in Ket, we mention the
respective orientation of the conjugation classes, but will refer to them simply as
""conjugation I, II, etc."" in the remainder of this grammar206.
The notion of transitivity is taken in its traditional (non-scalar) definition, i.e. a
transitive construction/verb will be one with (and an intransitive construction one
without) an overt patient/object.
4.4.3.1 Conjugation I
The sentential subject is encoded in P8 (for transitive and intransitive verbs),
objects are referenced in P4, P3, or P1.
The P8 subject morphemes, identical for singular and plural207, are:
1SG/PLdi
2SG/PLku
3SG/PLm du
3SG/PLf da208
The distribution of object morphemes in transitive verbs of this class is:
1SG P1di
2SG P1ku
3SGmP4a (o)209
3SGfP4i
3SGnP3b
1PL P1da~
2PL P1ka~
3PL P4a~ (o~)
Subject and object morphemes in the verbal chain of conjugation I verbs:
P8 P7 P6 P5 P4 P3P2P1RPL
dia (o)b di
kuiku
dua~ (o~)da~
da ka~
206
The essence of conjugations I-IV has been clearly worked out and described for the first
time by Comrie (1982). He summarizes the Ket agreement system in a table on p. 125
(terminology: DI affixes = our P8, BI affixes = our P6, DII affixes = our P1); his categories
may by and large be translated into our system as follows: a) Primary DI + Secondary Ø,
number agreement = conjugation I; Primary DI + Secondary BI, number agreement =
conjugation II; Primary DI + Secondary DII, variable number agreement = conjugation IV;
Primary DII + Secondary Ø, no number agreement = conjugation III.

Subject plural is signalled by the PL morpheme -Vn following R, discussed in 4.4.5.5.

d-), while elision refers to complete loss of such a morpheme, although it can be
shown to be paradigmatically present. For brevity's sake, both kinds of processes
will be referred to as T Rs (""truncation rules""), which are given in a somewhat
arbitrary order below.
4.4.4.2.1 Truncation Rule 1 (TR1):
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf. /da-/) loses its vowel when immediately standing
before the preterite marker /il/, /in/ in P2, i.e. in configuration P8-P2:
di8-loq~ ""I shiver""
vs.
d[i]8-il2-loq~ ""I shivered""
That the only /i/ present in the surface form belongs to P2, rather than to P1, is clear
from the 2SG form:
k[u]8-il-loq~""you shivered""
4.4.4.2.2 Truncation Rule 2 (TR 2)
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf. /da-/) loses its vowel when immediately standing
before some overt marker in P3 (i.e. b, inactive 3SG inanimate, or applicative and
any phonetic material intervening between P3 and R (P8-P3-x-R):
d[i]8-b3-il2-a ""I ate it""
vs.
di8-b3-a ""I eat it""
The intervening phonetic material (x) is here, of course, the P2 preterite marker, but
any morpheme occupying P1 equally provides the required configuration.
4.4.4.2.3 Truncation Rule 3 (TR 3)
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf /da/) loses its vowel in configuration P8-P5-P4-x-R:
d[i]8-t5-o4-[i]l2-o~ ""I saw""
vs.
di8-t5-o~""I see""
Note: the resulting initial sequence td- is, in the speech of most speakers, further
simplified to t- . Other potential clusters resulting from this and similar rules,
however, remain intact at least for some speakers (thus producing the only
exceptions to the language's general tendency to avoid initial clusters). The P4
206 A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
vowel /a / (present in the preterite in regularly labialized form) is elided in the
present form regularly before a vowel-initial root.
4.4.4.2.4 Truncation Rule 4 (TR 4)
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf. /da/) loses its vowel in the configuration P8-P4-x-R:
d[i]8-a4-(j)-s""I dress him""
vs.
di8-ku1-s ""I dress you""
The bracketed (j) in the first example is due to SR 5 (s. b.).
4.4.4.2.5 Truncation Rule 5 (TR 5)
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf. /da -/) loses its vowel immediately before any
vowel-initial P7 incorporate or P6 subject/object marker: P8-P7V/P6V:
d[i]8-™t7-a4-d[i]1-daq ""I go into the forest""
or
d[u]8-a/k6-(i)-(s)-toq ""he assaults him""
The truncation of the last /i/ (P1) in the first form is due to Sync (s.b.). The second
example shows two anaptyctic elements, (s) due to SR 4 and (i) because of VIR 3
(operative in that order).
4.4.4.2.6 Truncation Rule 6 (TR 6)
Any P8 subject marker (≠ 3SGf. /da- /) is completely elided when occurring
immediately before any consonant initial P7 incorporate or P6 subject marker: P8-
P7C/P6C:
[du]8-lubid7-ku/k6-a4-bed""he loves you""
4.4.4.2.7 Truncation Rule 7 (TR 7)
The P6 determiner /k is elided immediately before epenthetic /d/ produced by SR 11
(cf. 4.4.4.4.11):
d[i]8-bo/[k]6-(d)-i4-(t)-[i]l2-it225 <dbodítlit>

The second (t-) separator in this form is inserted because of SR 9, cf.4.4.4.4.9.

function as adverbs in that they modify the predicate. Most postpositions express
local relations and, while the semantic force of some local postpositions may be
metaphorically extended to capture temporal relations as well, others are
exclusively temporal.
Formally, postpositions may be derived from (identical with, etymologically related
to) concrete nouns, adjectives and, of course, adverbs.
All postpositions require their (nominal) head to be in the genitive, thus:
(((NOUN)-GEN) postposition)
Some postpositions arose from concrete nouns or adjectives with a (petrified)
possessive prefix of the 3rd person singular neuter:
dúkda ""during"" < d-úkda
 3SGn-long
A unique use of Ket postpositions is that as syntactic subordinators. Some
postpositions may be directly used after finite verb forms (i.e. without any prior
nominalization of the verb, and consequently without any linking genitive suffix),
in order to form various kinds of dependent clauses.
The basic spatial postpositions are mostly found expanded by case suffixes. Here
the locative denotes location without movement, the ablative movement from, the
dative movement to, and the prosecutive a passing movement (""passing behind, in
front of etc.""). The full set of these possibilities is displayed by175:

LOCbál-ka""id.""
DATbáldi~a ""id., directional""
ABLbál-di~al ""from between""
PROSEC bál-bes ""passing through between""
In the following, we enumerate the most common postpositions found in Ket,
discussing their functions and their etymological relations to other lexical items
found in the language. Some treatments of Ket differentiate between ""true""
postpositions, and postpositional nouns, the latter being concrete nouns (usually
designating some locational notion, or a body part, which is used metaphorically to
indicate such a notion. The number of such postpositional nouns may be regarded
as principally open, delimited only by the number of semantically suitable nouns:
e.g., a noun meaning ""left side"" (Ket t!l qóleb), used with the genitive of some
object noun and a local case suffix
NOUN-GEN left.side-LOC
175
In the following, we list postpositions only with those case suffixes, which were actually
found in either our field material or the Ketological literature (most notably Werner 1997c,
Werner 2002 passim , and the works of Šerer, e.g. 1983). Other combinations may,
however, be possible in the language.

"The following discussion of Ket verbal morphemics will begin with a presentation
of these five conjugations . This will be followed by a detailed presentation of
morphotactic rules, which pervade the whole verbal morphology; these rules are
unique in that they determine truncation and elision of morphological markers
(sometimes only parts of them) according to the actual presence or absence of
concrete fillers in the various morphemic slots; they do not react simply to the
phonetic surrounding of an affected morpheme, nor can they be described as
MORPHOLOGY 189
morphophonemic. We thus follow Edward Vajda, who first described these rules
for Ket (Vajda 2001) and dubbed them morphotactic.
Following this, the individual morpheme slots will be discussed one by one,
showing the possible fillers and their functions, as well as all phonetic distortions
they may be subject to (including, of course, again morphotactic rules, but also
phonotactic and other factors). The discussion of verbal morphology will then be
continued by sections on mood, especially imperatives (4.4.6). This is followed by
a more detailed description of derived categories (4.4.7). In this section, some
verbal categories, which are regularly expressed by the exploitation of this very
productive and versatile morphological technique, will be discussed, too, such as
causatives, and several aktionsart-like categories. Sections on nominal verb forms
(infinitives, ""participles""), ""copulae"" and predicative affixes, as well as a number of
illustrative paradigms - including those of truly idiosyncratic and irregular verbs -
conclude this chapter.
4.4.3The five conjugation classes
In order to be able to correctly inflect a given Ket verb, its conjugation class (or
simply conjugation) has to be known. Though most verbs (i.e. either verbal roots,
or derived verbs consisting of R plus either a P5 preverb, a P7 incorporate or both)
will typically belong to one of these conjugations, some fluctuation does also occur,
i.e. some verbs may be inflected according to more than one conjugational pattern
(and some paradigms mix forms from different conjugations). It is usually the case
that one speaker will conjugate a given verb according to one conjugational pattern
only; in some cases a speaker will be willing to accept a different pattern, too, but
equally often this may be rejected by some speakers, while accepted by others.
Generally, no difference in function or semantic content is entailed by such
alternatives (nor do the different conjugations as such express any clearly
determinable and fully operational semantic/functional content). The (albeit
limited) versatility of conjugational patterns for some verbs may reflect as yet
undetected dialectal (or subdialectal) differences, which could in principle be
elucidated by a full appraisal of all attested conjugated verb forms, but it seems also
to be likely that the functional ""emptiness"" of these patterns, together with ongoing
language death (which also led to some cases of first-language-attrition in formerly
fully competent speakers) leads to a certain degree of uncertainty on the side of
some speakers, how a given verb ""should"" be conjugated.
Some of the Ket conjugations are markedly characterized by grouping certain
argument positions together (or ""treating them alike"") against others, along the lines
of syntactic ""alignment"". Thus, conjugation I treats sentential subject and object in
what has been described as an ""active"" way, conjugation II may be referred to as
""ergative"" etc. This is the only grammatical domain of the language where such
instances of (non-nominative) alignment are found, and the use of an ""ergative"" or
""active"" verb in any construction does not exert any influence on the behaviour of
any other syntactic constituent.

" 92A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
 4.1.1.2.2 Plural
 Nominal plurals in Ket may be formed in different ways; most commonly the plural
 is characterized by an overt plural suffix (4.1.1.2.4.1), but it may also be indicated
 by a change of the root vowel (4.1.1.2.4.3), a change in tone (4.1.1.2.4.4), or a
 combination of the latter two techniques (4.1.1.2.4.5). Moreover, entirely
 suppletive plural forms do exist as well (4.1.1.2.4.7).
 4.1.1.2.3 Traces of natural dual, or paral
 There is no dual in Ket, but at least in the case of a few naturally paired objects, two
 different plural forms exist, one of which denotes a natural pair:
 dŒs ""eye"": dès ""a pair of eyes"" :désta~ ""many eyes""
 bánna ""sleeve"" : bánna-n ""pair of sl."" : bánna-n-i~ ""many sleeves""
 ólta""testicle"" : ólta-~ "" a pair of t."" :ólta-kin""scrotum""
 ókde""ear"": ókde-n ""a pair of ears"" : ókde-n-i~ ""many ears""
 This remains a rare pattern, though; generally, in the absence of explicit numerals
 or adverbs of quantity, the singular form of nouns denoting natural pairs denotes
 one instance of such a pair, rather than only one eye, foot, sleeve, etc. This is
 underlined by the fact that, in order to emphasize that only one single eye, sleeve
 etc. is being talked about, Ket uses a strategy which is found widely in Eurasian
 languages, viz. to use the expression ""half eye (etc.)""; qóleb ""half"" may be used as a
 modifying adjective to denote one item of a pair, or it may form a bahuvr–hi- like
 compound with its head to indicate the possessor of this item, cf.:
(5)
 qóleb b!l
 half leg

2.6 Notational conventions and façons de parler
Throughout the following - non-phonological - sections of this book, the
transcription used will closely reflect the phonological system outlined and
described below (chapter 3). However, for practical reasons, the following
conventions are introduced:
The correct morphological parsing of verbal forms will often involve the
cancellation of several surface morphonological processes in the notation. Verbal
forms will be given parsed according to the principles outlined in the chapters on
morphology, sometimes accompanied by a representation of their surface
manifestation; thus, e.g., ""I am going"" (√-tn) will be given as
 bo/k6-a4-tn
 1/D-T-go
in some cases accompanied by <bo¥ótn>, or, in Central Ket, <bo¥út>, which are
closer to the forms actually heard. In the parsed transcriptions, certain
morphonological rules are deliberately violated, or cancelled, such as the
intervocalic voicing and spirantization rule (of /k/ and /q/), while they are largely
represented in the bracketed notation, which thus remains closer to that of other
Ketologists, resp. of the various orthographic conventions for Ket. However, even
here, phonetic palatalization is not given, nor is non-phonemic, predictable vowel
allophony (especially if leading to [æ], [ø], [ø], [œ] respectively, which are normally
reflected in other notational traditions of Ketology).
Examples taken from published sources are retranscribed into the notational system
used throughout this book, except where noted otherwise, or where phonetic details
are central to the discussion.
2.6.1 The verbal formula
The parsing of finite verb forms is justified throughout chapter 4.4 and the
representation of full and/or partial paradigms is outlined in section 2.6.4.
If verbs are quoted as lexical entries, a schematic ""verbal formula"" is applied
throughout.
This formula contains the purely ""lexical"" elements of the Ket verb in the linear
order in which they occur in an actual form, separated by hyphens, thus starting
with any P7 incorporate46 (cf. 4.4.5.2), followed by any P5 determiner (4.4.5.4) and
giving the lexical root (R, 4.4.5.1) at the rightmost edge. This string of lexical
elements is then invariably followed by an indication of the conjugation class (I-V,
46
 ""P"" stands for ""position"", and denotes one of the numbered morphological ""slots"" of the
Ket verb, cf. 4.4.2
40A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
with, if applicable, a subscript indication of morphologically transitive (tr) or
intransitive (itr) verbs, cf. 4.4.3).
If present, thematic a4 is given in brackets47, as is the preterite marker used with this
particular verb (i.e., in most cases, il or in, cf. 4.4.5.11)48.
With verbs of conjugation classes II and III, the ""series"" of the P6 (subject and
object) markers, which is not predictable, has to be indicated. This is done by
bracketed (bo) or (ba). In these cases, following determiners are described in this
grammar as ""co-occupying"" slot P6, rather than P5. These are given after a slash (/)
in the same bracket as the P6 marker. More on P6 markers is to be found in 4.4.5.7,
the justification of giving determiners as co-occupying P6 in these verbs is given in
4.4.5.3. Some examples:
loq~ Iitr (il) ""to shiver, tremble""
 intransitive verb of conjugation I, no a4, preterite in il
tn IIitr (bo/k) (a) (in) ""to go""

 itr. v, conj. III, ba-series in P6, determiner t, a4, pret.

tan IVitr (a) (il) ""to stop, remain standing""
 itr. verb, conj. IV, a4, pret. in in
This formula (usually given in italics in this grammar) summarizes the minimum
morphological information necessary to generate correct finite forms, or, for that
matter, to correctly parse forms found in texts or other sources.
2.6.2 The notation of Ket words
The transcription of Ket words in this grammar is intended to be as phonemic as
possible. This makes it inevitable that some Ket words and morphemes - among
them frequent lexical items and important affixes - may look at times unfamiliar to
readers with some acquaintance with earlier ketological literature. The most
important deviations from traditional Ketology (and, mutatis mutandis, from Ket
orthography, as well) are the following:
47
 The status of this element as a lexical element vs. a purely morphological marker is
disputed (cf. 4.4.5.8.2); though we treat it as mostly lexical in nature (it cannot be ""switched
on or off"" by purely morphological processes; it may, though, as Vajda thinks, have a
function describable in morphological terms), we chose this notation in order to reflect its
somewhat unclear status.
48
 Of course, the preterite markers are morphological in nature, but the choice of the proper
variant is governed by lexical factors only (at least in synchronically observable Ket and
Yugh), so they need to be given in the formula, but are, here, removed from the purely
lexical elements.

 - a lexical root, which is generally found at the end of the morpheme
 chain (followed optionally by a subject plural marker); the lexical core
 of the verb may be (and very often is) compounded, in which case one
 of the elements is found further left in the morpheme chain (at position
 P7, where incorporated elements are also placed; in fact, all these cases
 can be explained as instances of incorporation ); in a few cases -
 discussed in 4.4.5.1, the material representation of the root morpheme is
 eroded, leaving the verb form without an overt root morpheme,
 - one or several actant markers, indicating at least the person (and,
 sometimes, class) of the main actant (subject, agent), or the
 object/patient of transitives; however, a verb with two actant markers
 may cross-reference the sentential subject twice in its morpheme chain;
 the choice of actant markers and their distribution over the morpheme
 chain is largely lexically determined and leads to the classification of
 Ket verbs into five different conjugations.
Any Ket verb form may furthermore contain:
MORPHOLOGY185
-a determiner , usually consisting of one consonant, and occupying a
 specific slot in the morpheme chain (P5), though this position is debated
 among Ketologists: while there is general agreement that slot P5 exists
 and is the proper host of determiners, some facts seem to call for
 analyzing at least some determiners as (co-)occupying either slot P6 to
 the left, or slot P4 to the right. Determiner is a traditional term, which is
 revived here, though recent works use other designations for this type of
 morphemes, such as preverb , or adposition; all observers agree that
 determiners are lexical/derivative in nature and contribute to the
 semantics of the complex verb, though the exact semantic force of them
 is difficult to establish and mostly elusive,
-an overt tense marker, only in preterite forms,
-an overt plural marker, indicating the plurality of the sentential subject
 or agent,
-an incorporated element; the decision whether a given element is
 inserted in its appropriate position (P7) by productive incorporation or
 whether a formal incorporate has developed, together with the original
 root, into a compound verb, is largely semantically determined,
-the incorporated element (in slot P7) may be morphologically complex,
 containing i.a. markers of plurality, iterativity, or the highly productive
 causative marker.
4.4.2 Position class
In the history of Ket studies, the structure of the verb has been described in often
widely differing ways. Up to 15 morpheme classes (or position classes, or orders)
have been identified. The following treatment of the Ket verb basically follows
Vajda's analysis, which assumes the presence of ten distinct position classes
(including the root and the rightmost slot for an optional subject plural affix).
The following table outlines these position classes (from P8, the leftmost slot,
counting downward to P1, the R[oot], and PL, the optional subject plural marker
standing after/to the right of the root morpheme):
P8 - P7 - P6 - P5 - P4 - P3 - P2 - P1 - R - PL
P8 subject person
P7 lexical incorporate
P6 subject or object person ( sometimes + /determiner)
P5 lexical determiner
P4 subject/object person or ""thematic"" vowel, partially
 sensitive to tense
P3 (neuter object) person (or - petrified - applicative/intensive)
P2 tense (preterite)
P1 subject or object person (or petrified resultative marker)
Rlexical root
PL subject plural

"4.1.4.4.15 The postposition daan ""when, while, during""
This temporal (pseudo-) postposition (dáqan in NK) is exclusively used with finite
verb forms to link two predications. It expresses simultaneity of action with that of
the main verb of the sentence. An interesting differentiation, first described by
Gri«ina 1981, involves the temporal relationship between two predications linked
by daan. Thus, if both verbal actions are depicted as temporally coextensive, they
will both be represented by verbs in the same tense (which is usually the preterite):
(160)
 ƒd [di]8-ses7-o4-[i]l2-ta daan d˜l d[u]8-an7-il2-da
 I 1-sit-Th-Pst-Rwhile child 3-play-Pst-R
 While I was sitting, the child was playing. (Gri«ina 1981, 32)
If the verbal action of the main clause is depicted as occurring at a single point in
time during the duration of the subordinate (backgrounded) verbal action, the latter
will be expressed by a verb in the present tense, and the former (usually) in the
preterite:
(161)
 b–s– d[u]8-⁄n7-(s)-[q]-ut daan ta¿j bŒj o/k6-o4-[i]n2-[t]n
 evening sun 3-set-(Sep)-set while cold wind 3SG-Th-Pst-go
 In the evening, at sunset, a cold wind blew. (Gri«ina 1981, 32)
The linear order of both predications is generally (subordinate - main), as in the
above examples, but this may be reversed:

" MORPHOLOGY193
With few exceptions, this pattern requires monosyllabic P7 incorporates. Disyllabic
incorporated possessa trigger a different conjugational pattern (belonging to
Conjugation II, but with some irregularities, cf. 4.4.5.2.3.1). This extends to P7
incorporates, which are only historically disyllabic. The most obvious consequence
of this rule/tendency is the fact that pluralized P7 possessa allow the verbum
habendi to be formed according to this Conjugation I pattern only as long as the
respective nouns form their lexical plural without any syllabic suffix (cf. 4.1.1.2.4
for the formation of noun plurals in general).
This sensitivity of position P7 to the number of syllables it contains or contained is
further illustrated in 4.4.5.2.3.1.
Apart from this highly frequent pattern, there is only a handful of Conjugation I
intransitives marking their single actant in this (""active"") way.
Though this subpattern is indeed rare, the distribution of personal morphemes in
non-object function unites this paradigm with the transitive paradigm given above.
It is thus certainly justified to view the distribution of morphemes in this
conjugation as reminiscent of the ""active"" alignment pattern (subject/single
argument of intransitive inactive verbs encoded like object/patient of transitive
verbs, and subject of transitive verbs encoded like subject/single argument of
intransitive active verbs). The designation ""active conjugation"" may thus be used as
a mnemonic to show the resemblance of the morpheme distribution with otherwise
known active/inactive patterns, but it should not lead to far-reaching conclusions
about Ket morphosyntax212.
4.4.3.2 Conjugation II
Transitive verbs of this class mark their subject in P8 and objects in P6, while the
single actant of an intransitive verb is marked in P6 only. This configuration has led
observers to refer to this conjugation as the ""ergative"" (or ""absolutive"", as in recent
works by E. Vajda) conjugation, because it treats the patient of transitive verbs and
the subject/single actant of intransitives alike.
The P8 (transitive) subject morphemes are the same as in conjugation I (""active"").
Here, they can be referred to as the ""ergative"" actant morpheme. The morphemes
filling P6 (as indicators of direct object or single actant/subject of intransitives) are:
1SG ba~bo
2SG ku
3SGma~o
212
In fact, I wish to emphasize that I view it as quite unlikely that Ket may be meaningfully
described as a language possessing ""active"" traits. All ""inactive"" paradigms of conjugation
I are (sometimes highly) irregular and it seems possible to make the point that this ""pattern""
rather consists of an array of verbs, which show various degrees of paradigm mixing,
involving ""resultativity"" and a certain attraction by Conjugation IV (q.v.). I present these
patterns here (and some more paradigms in 4.4.10), but a thorough discussion of their
raison d'être transcends the scope of this grammar and must be placed in a wider - and, of
course, historical - context. By the time volume II of this grammar sees the light of the day,
I hope to be able to inform readers about the place where this discussion has materialized.

language contact with a language which must have been Yeniseic, most probably
Ket29.
Other nationalities present in the Ket villages include of course the Russian and
Ukrainian majorities and a sizable number of individuals belonging to ethnic groups
deported to Siberia during World War II, including Volga Germans, Estonians,
Latvians, Lithuanians, Kuban Greeks, and other peoples of the former Soviet
Union; some individuals still use the emblematic languages of their nationalities.
2.5History of the investigation of Ket/Yeniseic30
The first Russian explorers reached the Yenisei relatively shortly after the cossack
leader Yermak's successful campaigns against the Turkic Khanate Sibir' in the
1580s, the event, which is traditionally taken as the beginning of the Russian
expansion across the Ural mountain range, and which eventually led to the
establishment of ""Siberia"" as an integral part of the Russian Empire. The first
Russians reached the region of the Yenisei and its left affluents as early as the first
decade of the 17th century. They were ""tax-collectors"" who extended the fur-tax
system (yasak) long before established to the West of the Urals to the terra nova in
the East. Semi-permanent settlements, later fortresses (ostrogs), were set up for this
purpose, some of which remained stable and developed into full-scale cities.
Mangazeya on the river Taz - in Sel'kup territory - was one of these early
encampments, now abandoned, which imposed the fur-tax regime on the natives of
the region already in 1601. Parts of the Ket and Yeniseian population were
doubtlessly in the range of this system from its very beginning (in 1607, an outpost
from Mangazeya was established at a place called Inbak), and the Pumpokol tribe
officially accepted the yasak31. The city of Tomsk, to the West of the Yeniseian
territory, was founded in 1604, in 1619 Yeniseisk (in Yugh and Pumpokol
territory), and in 1628 Krasnoyarsk and Kansk (the former in Arin, the latter in
Assan and Kott territory) followed suit. In order to establish their right on the yasak,
Russians had to break the power of the Turkic Yenisei Kirghiz, until then the
political overlords of the upper reaches of the Yenisei (and yasak -collectors
themselves). No collections of Ket or Yeniseian linguistic data were undertaken in
these early days, but some ethnographical observations, and of course clan, place
and personal names, can be found in historical documents surviving from this time
(for details cf. Dolgich 1960).

be found in Vajda 2001, 1-17. This outstanding book contains a remarkably complete
bibliography of virtually everything written and published on Yeniseian linguistics and
ethnography before the 21st century, and no student of Ket can afford to ever be without it.

4.4.3.3 Conjugation III
Two markers of the subject, one in position P8, and the other in P6, characterize this
conjugation; in transitive verbs, the direct object is marked in P4-P3-P1 in the same
fashion as in conjugation I. Because of its redundant second subject marker, Vajda
refers to this pattern as the ""coreferential absolutive construction"". The P8 subject
marker is present in both transitive and intransitive verbs, and transitive objects are
marked differently, so this pattern may be said to reflect nominative alignment.
The ""coreferential"" person affixes in P6 are identical with the object markers in
conjugation II, with the following exception: any 3rd person subject (singular and
plural) in P6 is encoded by -bu-, instead of the array of suffixes found in this slot in
conjugation II, where they mark true ""absolutive""; in other words, in conjugation
III the opposition of class and number is neutralized for 3rd persons in the
semantically empty ""coreferential"" slot.

4.4.3.4 Conjugation IV
This conjugation (called the ""coreferential inactive"" conjugation in the works of E.
Vajda) is again characterized by two markers of the sentential subject, this time in
P8 and P1 respectively. P6 contains, like in conjugation II, markers of the direct
object, but only very few transitive (object-marking) verbs of conjugation IV are
known; the various slots accept the morpheme sets outlined above.
P8 contains the usual subject markers, as found with conjugations I, II, and III.
In the few transitive verbs of this class, P6 object markers are the same as in
conjugation II, with the restriction that only ""bo-""series markers are attested. It
remains thus unclear, whether ""ba-"" object morphemes are categorically impossible
here, or whether their non-attestation is a contingent result of the overall rarity of
conjugation IV transitives. The content of P1 is different from the pattern found in
conjugations I and III, in that it not only features markers for the ""speech-act-
participants"", but also 3rd person morphemes. Additionally, conjugation IV verbs
may display a P3 -b- (which elsewhere serves as a neuter object, ""applicative"" or
intensive marker, cf. 4.4.5.9) as indicator of inanimate subjects (echoed in P1, as all
other subject markers in this conjugation class), cf.:

*d[i]8-u6-k/d5-o4-b3-il2-do-n
""we prepared it""
The reanalysis consists of acknowledging only one P5 determiner and moving the
other one as a co-occupant of P6 (which, as pointed out above, virtually never
occurs without a determiner), thus the verbal formulae and forms given above may
be (and are here) rewritten as:
t5-ka~qutn IVtr (a) (il) (bo/k)

d5-do IItr (a) (il) (bo/k)
d[i]8-u/k6-d5-o4-b3-il2-do-n
Some other cases, where seemingly two determiners have to be accommodated by
the formal analysis can be accounted for in different ways (i.e. by eliminating one
determiner from V/Z's representations), cf. the discussion below.
Recently (2003) Vajda proposed to assign several other determiners (namely, some
instances of d and t) to the following slot P4, basically using the same argument (i.e.
in order to keep P5 free of more than one morpheme)289. As a corroborating
argument, he points to the fact that these morphemes seem always to co-occur with
a following (thematic or actant, cf. 4.4.5.8) morpheme in P4, which would mirror
the situation found with P6.
In sum, if we regard the avoidance of having more than one marker in the lexical
slot P5 as a justified objective290, we are left with the choice between two basic
solutions:
 P6P5P4
ba/t /a
ku/  k /i
... (a)...(b)...
289
He refers to these morphemes as proclitics, as opposed to adpositions, which occupy his
P5 position.
290
Of cource both solutions have to accept that, then, P6 or P4 are overpopulated. However,
it seems slightly preferable to us to see some P5 markers routinely paired with P4 (since
thematic a4 is quite frequent in Ket, functionally opaque, and prone to be analogically
extended to contexts/paradigms which did not originally possess it). On the other hand,
reasons why any verb, which fills P6 with an actant marker should obligatorily require the
verb to possess a (lexical) P5 determiner are hard to find. The solution adopted here states
simply that many verbs fill P5 with some determiner, and, if so, they cling closely to any
possible preceding P6 actant marker, making room for a possible further P5 marker; the fact
that Vajda's P4 d / and t/ occur mostly, if not exclusively, with an overt marker in P4 can be
viewed as an artefact of the overall high frequency of P4 in Ket verbs.

"4.1.2 Derivation and compounding of substantive nouns
Suffixal derivation is untypical for Ket. However, a small number of derivative
morphemes may be distinguished, the most important of which is the frequent
 MORPHOLOGY 121
nominalizer -s, which turns many parts of speech, which may be used attributively,
into substantive nouns (4.1.2.1). There are only a few other morphological
elements, which may be described as derivators.
The dominating noun-forming technique of Ket is compounding. In fact, since the
overwhelming majority of polysyllabic nouns seem to consist of at least two
discernable lexical elements, it is probably safe to assume that in fact all such nouns
are in fact historically compounds, although some of them may no longer be
sufficiently transparent.
Most compound nouns consist of a determining and a determined (""head"") element,
always found in that linear order (i.e. they are ""tatpurus·a""-compounds, to use a term
from the Indo-Europeanist tradition). These may further be subdivided into
compounds whose are separated by a - petrified - genitive marker (4.1.2.3.2) and
those lacking such a linker (4.1.2.3.1). The presence or absence of this marker may
be indicative of the relative age of the formation, or of the compound's ""degree of
coherence"", with genitive-linked compounds being possibly ""younger"" or ""less
 coherent"" than those of the other group. A few instances, where the same lexical
elements occur in compounds with and without this linker, may be further
indications for the correctness of this assumption.
Another differentiating behaviour of compounds is found in the domain of plural
formation, where some compounds routinely pluralize both elements (which may
be indicative of a lower degree of coherence) while others pluralize only one
element, usually the head (4.1.2.3.1.1, 4.1.2.3.2.1).
In the following paragraphs, we will illustrate, apart from the points mentioned
above, nominal compounds in terms of the parts-of-speech which may occur as
determining elements in Ket tatpurus·as, ""heavy"" determiners and heads, i.e. ones
consisting of more than one element (4.1.2.3.4), and a few frequent determiners,
which show a certain degree of paradigmaticity, which makes them resemble
""prefixes"" (the sexus-differentiating nouns, 4.1.2.3.3.1).
A special discussion is required by a moderately extensive set of very frequent
compound heads, which have sometimes been described as ""suffixes"" in the
Ketological literature. More recently, the notion of ""semisuffixes"" has been
introduced into the discussion, indicating that these elements remain - on the one
hand - identifiable with independently occurring content nouns of the language, but
- on the other hand - have sometimes undergone some surface-changing erosive
processes, which may in some instances even obscure their origin. However, since
the origin of these elements is generally - if not always for speakers of the
language, but certainly for the linguist - clearly determinable as content nouns, we
describe ""semi-suffixation"" as just another instance of noun composition
(4.1.2.3.3.2).
Ket thus presents itself as a language, where the grammaticalization of content
nouns to true deriving affixes has so far - with very few exceptions - reached a
stage where the lexical origin of some affix-like elements is mostly still clear. A
special group of these ""semisuffixes"" - diminutive and singulative forming
elements - has to be singled out, which may be regarded as closest to ""true""
suffixes.

"248A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
However, at least an etymological identity of these -q-s cannot be ruled out and
both solutions (a suffix on P7 and a P5 determiner) remain basically defendable. We
prefer the former solution, chiefly in order to highlight the function of the
causativizer as an operator on the incorporate (if this is a verb, the resulting
meaning is a ""true"" causative, ""to make sb. (do) P7"", if an adjective, factitive
meanings result, ""to make sb./sth. (be) P7""). A further argument comes from the
discussion in the following chapter: there, it will be seen that in some cases
categorically distinct morphemes tend to co-occur, sometimes to the degree of
virtually never being found without each other. ""Determiners"" are notorious for this
behaviour, and (together with the principle not to overpopulate the ""true""
determiner position P5 with more than one morpheme, s.b.), various parsing
solutions have been proposed, which allow positions to the right or the left of P5 to
be co-occupied by a ""determiner"". Apart from the semantic-functional argument
given above, our writing of the causativizer -q- as a suffix on P7 is consistent with
our overall approach of attaching these ""out-of-bounds"" morphemes to the
morpheme to the left, rather than to the right (as it happens in parts of Vajda's
system)285. A detailed discussion and justification of this solution is given in the
following chapter.
4.4.5.3 ""Determiners"": flotsam between P7 and P4
This section discusses morphemes - exclusively consisting of one consonantal
phoneme only - found in a great many of verbs between the slot positions P7 and P4.
The morphemes found here are:
t, k (very frequent), d (common), h, n,~ (rare)286
Recall from the previous chapter that the causativizer q, though here analyzed as a
suffixal increment on P7 incorporates, may under certain circumstances also be
viewed as belonging to this set of determiners.
The specialist literature refers to these morphemes by a variety of terms (i.a.
""preverbs"" - Vajda 2000, 2001, or ""adpositions"" - Vajda 2002 and onward); here we
propose to return to the more traditional - and intentionally vague - designation
""determiners"" (henceforth without quotes). The behaviour of determiners is a
healthy reminder that the template structure defended here (as well as any
competing slot-based analysis) is a useful way to make sense of the ordering of
morphemes in Ket and similarly organized languages, but that, on the other hand, it
is also to some degree an artefact of the analysis.
Though it may be regarded as a straightforward solution to assign all of these
morphemes simply to P5, such an option is not without problems. Doing so would
285
This practice implies that we of course accept the possibility that the causativizer
originally began its life as just another P5 determiner, before permanently leaning leftward
to a P7 incorporate.
286
These are the possible shapes of determiners; though their functions remain difficult to
ascertain, it may be the case that the number of actual morphemes (i.e. function-form-
clusters) is greater.

" THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE17
2.2.2 Kott
The first and last linguist, who worked on the Kott language with native informants
was M.A. Castrén, who found a small settlement on the river Kan' (East of
Krasnoyarsk), which was already at that time home to only five Kott individuals,
who may have been the last speakers of this language.
Kott was also spoken, in the XVIIth century A.D., along the river Biryusa (a right
tributary of the Yenisei), and, possibly, on the Abakan (in Khakassia), the Mrass
and the Kondoma (the latter two are tributaries of the river Tom' which in turn
flows to the Ob' in the West); Kott may thus be a substratum language for the
Turkic language Shor, which is spoken in this region. Toponymic evidence
(hydronyms containing the element -«et/-‰et, cf. Kott «et ""river"") indicates that Kott
settlements extended in the East into the Western parts of the Irkutskaya Oblast'
and in the West until the river Tom'.
The Kyshtym language, for which Strahlenberg 1730 records 30 words, was a
variant of Kott, probably its southernmost variant.
The self-designation of the Kotts has been recorded as Kottuen12. This name may,
however, be originally a foreign exonym, cf. Buryat xoton ""settlement"", Written
Mongolian qota(n) ""id., city"", a term used by Mongolic tribes for non-nomadizing
neighbours13. It is also recorded as the autonym of the Assan (s.b.), whereas the
Arin called the Kott ""Assan"".
Apart from Ket and Yugh, Kott is the only Yeniseic language for which any
information beyond mere word-lists is available. Kott words have been recorded by
18th century travellers Messerschmidt, Miller and Fischer (s.b.), and have been
noted in the comparative dictionaries published by Pallas (1786) and Klaproth
(1823).
M.A. Castrén compiled a full description of Kott phonology and morphology, as
well as a fairly extensive vocabulary, which constitute the main corpus of available
Kott data. On the basis of these data, Werner published two monographs on Kott
(1990, 1997a), which summarize all known linguistic facts about the language14.
Both Castrén's data and those found in 18th century sources show internal
differences which indicate the existence of two Kott dialects; though some of the
observable variants may be due to imperfect transcription only, Werner (1997a, 6f.)
treats them as ""Kott A"" and ""Kott B"", respectively15.
However, no continuous texts and hardly any complete sentences in the Kott
language have ever been recorded.
2.2.3 Assan
The status of Assan as an independent Yeniseic language is not entirely clear. The
linguistic differences between Kott and data said to represent the ""Assan"" language
12
 There seems to be no linguistic reason, which justifies the geminate <tt> in this name.
13
 Even if this speculation be wrong, it deserves to be mentioned that the superficial
resemblance of Ket and Kott is only fortuitous.
14
 Werner 1990 contains a full Russian-Kott glossary.
15
 A note for users of Castrén 1858: Castrén is not consistent about this, but it seems that he
marked ""Kott B"" forms by an asterisk.

incorporated into their verbal ""formula""). Such verbs are not rare and it seems
justified to search for possible motivations for the presence of this morpheme in
them. Vajda (2004, 67ff.) discriminates between the following cases: according to
him, petrified b3 can form applicatives, intensives, involuntary causatives. It should
be borne in mind, though, that these labels are by no means to be taken as
functional descriptions of live morphological categories of Ket. They may serve as
more or less felicitous mnemonics trying to capture what are at best former,
historical functions of the b3-marker, which can no longer be actively ""switched on
or off"" by Ket speakers to achieve a desired semantic effect, nor is its presence or
absence governed by any syntactic circumstances or rules. Before we have a look at
the array of functional labels mentioned above we should, however, review the
distribution of such verbs among the different conjugation classes. An inspection of
the ""b-verbs"" listed in Vajda/Zinn 2004 shows that, out of 56 verbs (discounting
verbs which are only differentiated by different and semantically transparent P7
incorporates), no less than 43 belong to conjugation class II (27 transitives, 16
intransitives). Conjugation II is, thus, the hotbed of petrified b3, which is quite
surprising, since this conjugation does not normally mark a neuter object in this
position, but in P6 with a completely different set of morphemes (cf. 4.4.3.2). We
may then try to look for possible reasons why this phenomenon seems to favour
conjugation II. If we narrow down the sample of conjugation II verbs to those
which fill P6 with the b a-series of person markers (4.4.5.7), we should take
cognizance of the fact that, for this subgroup, the regular marker of 3rd SG neuter
objects is Ø. Though bo-verbs with petrified b 3 do occur, ba-type conjugation II
verbs are by far the most frequent subtype showing this phenomenon, which lends
some strength to the scenario outlined here (recall that bo-verbs mark 3rd neuter
object in P6 by u/6, thus no need would arise to introduce a ""foreign"" marker from a
different class to overtly mark this actant).
The regular 1st SG subject 3rd neuter object form of a conjugation II ba-verb like k5-
daq ""to throw, shoot"" would then be:
 *di8- Ø/k6-daq<díkdaq> ""I shoot it""
Now, while this form would be perfectly correct according to the conjugational
pattern (and such forms do in fact remain unchanged in some cases), it will be quite
understandable that the lack of an overt marker of the inanimate object may be felt
as infelicitous, so a suitable marker, namely b 3, could have been analogically
introduced from other conjugation classes to yield:
 [di]8- Ø/k5-(i)-b3-daq <kíbdaq>""I shoot it""
This is the actually attested form (surface-changed by morphotactic rules, which
operated regularly and predictably after the introduction of b3 into this form, which
is its only ""non-Conjugation II"" feature). From here, this b3 will then have spread
through the paradigm to be eventually present in all finite forms. Being an
analogical process, we should not expect it to take place always and everywhere (it
does not, of course), and we also expect to find verbs where b3 was introduced into
3rd SG neuter object forms, but not extended to other forms. In fact we do find
(albeit a few) such verbs, like for example:
MORPHOLOGY277
donan7-do IItr (a) (il) (ba/t)""to stab with a knife (iter.)""
 [di]8-donan7- Ø/t6-a4-b3-do ""I stab it repeatedly with a knife""
 but:
 da8-donan7-a~/t6-a4-do ""she stabs them""
Note that the first form also allows for a straightforward analysis in terms of
conjugation I: [di]8-donan7-t5-a4-b3-do (i.e. with no marker at all in P6 and regular
object marking in P3)365. We could thus speak of a ""mixed"" paradigm here, which
combines conjugation I and conjugation II forms; conjugation mixing is not
uncommon in Ket (4.4.3.6), but this analysis does of course not work for verbs,
which generalize this b3 throughout the paradigm, like e.g.:
t5-es IItr (b) (in)to draw
Subject: 3rd SG f

2PLda8-k™~/t6-(i)-b3-es
3PLda8-a~/t6-(i)-b3-es
The zero-marking of 3rd SG neuter objects in conjugation II ba-verbs366 is thus a
""keyhole"", through which b3 objects markers may have been introduced into such
forms, from where they could be generalized to the whole paradigms. This should
alert observers to the possibility that many (if not necessarily all) instances of
generalized/petrified/fossilized b3 may be (and some certainly are) due to a purely
formal, analogical process, for which no functional explanations are necessary.
That said, there are of course instances of generalized b3 in conjugation II bo-verbs
and, though quite rarely, in verbs of other conjugation classes, including
also intransitive verbs. For these367, we may look for possible functional
explanations. First of all, there are verbs, in which petrified b3 seems to fulfil the
365
Recall the oscillation of ""determiners"" between P6 and P5 from 4.4.5.3.
366
A further corollary is that the verb should be semantically capable of taking inanimate
objects, of course.
367
And of course for some conjugation II ba -verbs as well: for some of these, both the
formal, analogical, explanation and one of the functional possibilities mentioned below
seem to make much sense. Since the fossilization of b 3 is in no case predictible, both

function of an applicative marker. We define an applicative construction as one, in
which a peripheral sentential constituent is ""promoted"" to direct object status. Such
constituents are cross-linguistically often instruments, and we do find examples of
b3-verbs which explicitly convey the meaning that some action is carried out by
means of an instrument (very often a vehicle or other means of transport). Cf. the
following example (Vajda/Zinn 2004, 93):

e)Other P8 agreement markers, though they may be truncated and thus be
""dragged"" inside the realm of the phonological word, do show some signs of
basically not belonging to it; thus, in the (relatively rare) case that P8
agreement markers occur directly before the verbal root, without any
intervening element, the inherent tone of this root is generally preserved69.
f)Another language-internal rule which requires the notion of phonological
word is what we call here Vowel Insertion Rule 4 (VIR 4, cf. 4.4.4.3.4),
operative in finite verbs, which triggers the anaptyxis of /i/ between two
initial - clustering - consonants of the phonological word, i.e. after the P8
marker.
g)Finally, as demonstrated by Vajda 2001, disyllabic, including historically
disyllabic, P7 incorporates are followed by another boundary which divides
the morphological word into two phonological words. The hallmark of this
boundary is a virtual pause, and the prevention of the rule Sync (cf. 4.4.4.6),
when the phonologically eligible context for it is divided by this boundary.
The prosodic behaviour of tri-, quadrisyllabic and longer morpheme chains is more
complicated and has not been subject to intense scrutiny70.
Only few fairly recurrent patterns can be mentioned here, possibly only tendencies.
The default rule is that the first two syllables of the phonological word receive one
of the two disyllabic contours described above, leaving any syllable further to the
right as a toneless appendix; most common is the fifth contour, cf.
díldib™k""he pulled me""(d[u]8-il2-di1-b™k)
dúbb™kin""they pull it""(du8-b3-b™k-in)
bákissal""I spend the night"" (ba/k6-(i)-(s)-sal)
P8 3SGf /da/ stands outside of the phonological word:
 daíldib™k""she pulled me"" (da8-il2-di1-b™k)
The sixth contour is also found, though somewhat less often, e.g.:
di8-(k)-a4-daq (dìkadaq) ""I live""
Note the complicated case of the two-argument verb ""to beat"":
di8-(k)-a4-ted ""I beat him"" (díkated), fifth contour on the first two syllables,
vs.
di8-(k)-a~4-ted ""I beat you"" (diká~ted), sixth contour on the first two syllables

 Cf. for instance the paradigm of the verb t™™l ""to freeze"": di8- t™™l, ku8- t™™l, du8- t™™l,

da - t™™l; in such cases, it is justified to keep the inherent tone of the root syllable (here tone
3) in the transcription.

A good number of examples is thus explicable by assuming loan-word status,
sporadic regressive assimilations or a close etymological connection with
monosyllables showing the high vowels /i/ or /u/.
The overwhelming majority of other instances are clearly derived from
monosyllabic roots, which display tone 1, i.e. where the closed vowel quality -
predictable in monosyllabic roots - is maintained in affixed complexes and
compounds.

The inventory of phonemic consonants is given in the following table:
 labialalveolar lateral palatal velar uvular laryngeal
stop b t dk q
fricatives h
continuant lj
nasalm n~
As with the vowels, earlier treatments of Ket often assign phoneme status to
considerably more units. Thus, we often find /p/, /g/, /R/ and palatalized variants of
/s/, /t/, /d /, /n/ transcribed as phonemes in many works, and acknowledged in the
official Ket orthography.
/p/ is not recognized in this grammar, though a few contexts seem to require it as a
separate phoneme. In most cases, though, it is analyzable as devoiced /b/ in auslaut
position or adjacent to (phonemically) voiceless consonants.
The remaining cases include instances of initial /p-/, which are found in
a) loanwords
b) onomatopoetics
c) some unclear words from earlier recordings (mostly from O. Donner's work and
not found elsewhere), listed in the following table:

pys (? p˜s)""stopper of gun"" (c)
This list is, as far as we can tell, exhaustive, and no minimal pairs involving /p/ and
/b/ exist in Ket.
Another, marginal, instance of seemingly unmotivated /p/ is found in the verb form:
 <datopultet> ""she (the bitch) caught it (the meat)""
Analysis:da8-tob7-u/[k]6-[i]l2-ted
Alternatively, <datobultet> has also been recorded. The most likely explanation is
that the root, in P7 (here intervocalic) position, was analogically remodelled
according to its shape found in preconsonantal position, as e.g. in the infinitive
tob7-ted [tóptæt]. Similar cases are found, sporadically, with final -d [-t] in -bed,
which in some secondarily prevocalic contexts, especially when followed only by
the verbal pluralizer -Vn, is sometimes articulated voicelessly.
Yet another possible reason for the acknowledgement of /p / as a phoneme is the
occurrence of phonetic [p] in geminate form in less than a handful of words, viz.:
['op:as∆] ""stepfather""
['h⁄p: as∆] ""stepson""
Both are compounds with an (obsolete) lexical root, which may be reconstructed as
*-has (possibly earlier *-fas, *-pas), cf. 4.1.2.3.3.2.3. Obviously, these compounds
were formed in a fairly early stage of the language (very probably as early as Proto-
Northern-Yeniseic), where the consonantal onset of this word could cause the
gemination of final /b / (of ¡b ""father"", and h˜b ""son""), which in absolute auslaut
position was already devoiced to [p].
The resulting voiceless geminate stop cannot be written as <-bb ->, since this
geminate exists independently. We chose to render it as <-bh->, to be read as [p:],
in order to avoid the notation of a marginal /p /-phoneme with highly restrictive
distribution, thus:
76
 The similarity with the Sel'kup word is, of course, vague at best.

"THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE 33
Yeniseic peoples have been described in the early travel literature, beginning in the
17th century (cf. Vajda 2001, 1, for a concise account). However, linguistic data
begin to be recorded only a good one hundred years after ""contact time"".
The first lexical data from Yeniseic languages (Arin and Kott) to appear in print
seem to be those found in the work of the Swedish officer Strahlenberg (*1676, cf.
Strahlenberg 1730). Strahlenberg spent some 13 years in Russia as a prisoner of war
after the defeat of the Swedes at Poltava in the Great Nordic War in 1709. His work
was very influential in the 18th century and enjoyed some reputation as a first
attempt to classify some of the native languages of Siberia. Strahlenberg's exact
itinerary in the country remains, however, unknown, and it is unclear whether he
collected all linguistic data found in his book himself. In fact, it is known that he
was a part-time travel companion of the botanist D.G. Messerschmidt, who
travelled in Siberia between 1720 and 1727. It was the latter, who is distinguished
as being the first scholar to record Ket language data in the field. According to his
diary, he reached the estuary of the river Bakhta on the 9th of June 1723. He
managed to record several names of wild birds and a few numerals from the
language of the ""Ostyaks"" he encountered there, i.e. Kets. On the following day, on
the estuary of the rivulet ""Eed-«e« "" (lit. ""sable river"", modern Ket èd sŒs ), he
recorded a longer specimen.
In the following, we reproduce the list of Ket words (alphabetized, without the
numerals) found in Messerschmidt's diary, confronted with the same words (if any)
as given in Castrén's materials (1858, see below) and our modern notation of Ket
words, which may show the relative stability of the basic features of Ket phonology
during the last 280 years, as well as both Messerschmidt's and Castrén's ways of
putting Ket to writing:

2.2The Yeniseic family of languages
Ket is a member of the Yeniseic language family, consisting of Ket, Yugh (which
has for a long time been viewed and described as a Ket dialect, Sym-Ket ), Kott,
Arin, Assan , and Pumpokol. All Yeniseic languages save Ket are now definitely
extinct, and, apart from well-described Yugh and reasonably well-attested Kott,
fragmentary word-lists constitute our whole knowledge about them11. In the
following sections, the most important data on the location, time of extinction, and
available data are given for the extinct members of the family. It must be mentioned
that the documented history of Yeniseic may actually be much older. Though at
present (and very probably for good) lacking a decisive and final proof, the theory
that (atleast one of the languages of the) Xiongnu confederation, which ruled the
Central Asian steppes and Northern China in the centuries around the turn of the
Christian Era, might have been Yeniseic (or, to use a more conservative
formulation: did contain some Yeniseic elements) continues to be discussed in the
field. The most substantial contributions to this field are those by Ligeti (1950),
Pulleyblank (1962) and recently Vovin (2000, 2002). We might also mention our
own idea that the well-known Turkic/Mongolic religious term tengri (""sky, God"")
may have a Yeniseic etymology (Georg 2001).
2.2.1 Yugh
Since Castrén's times, the Yugh language was mostly, and sometimes continues to
be, referred to as the Sym dialect of Ket (symskij dialekt ketskogo jazyka), after the
river Sym , where its last speakers lived. Throughout the 20th century, it was the
southernmost language of the Yeniseic family. Apart from (Imbat-) Ket, the object
of this grammar, Yugh is the best known of all Yeniseic languages; already the first
coherent treatment of any Yeniseic language, Castrén 1858, was, though principally
pan-dialectal, heavily based on data from Yugh. The question, whether Yugh should
be regarded as a sister language of Ket, or as a mere dialect of it, is of little
theoretical importance. Suffice it to say that both languages/variants are closer to
each other within the family, than either is to any of the other extinct languages, that
their genetic relationship is obvious in every subsystem, but that the last living
speakers reported mutual unintelligibility with (Imbat) Ket, and that their
differences, again in all subsystems, certainly warrant a separate treatment. Yugh
data will thus not be discussed in this grammar. While the earlier literature
(especially Dul'zon 1968) treated both variants/languages promiscue, an in-depth
study of Yugh in its own right is Werner 1997c.
The name Yugh is unexplained (Ket jùk/j!k, Yugh d'uk); it should be mentioned,
though, that initial /j-/ is not normally found in native Yeniseian words.

As I write the last lines of this volume, I receive Werner 2005, a definite statement of all
remnants of Yeniseic languages of the XVIIIth century, with full descriptions of all
available data, exhaustive glossaries and some new discoveries and corrections to earlier
treatments.

"MORPHOLOGY 215
Recall from 3.1.3 that a disyllabic P7 incorporate is usually followed by a
phonological word-boundary, which distributes the last three vowels of this
morphological word between two different phonological words and thus prevents
Sync . Vajda (2000, 20) shows that this also holds for some monosyllabic P7
incorporates, which, however, may derive from originally disyllabic nouns, e.g.:
 [di]8-haj7-i/bed ""I make oars""
 hƒj, PL hàj is monosyllabic, but cf. Northern Ket (PL) hàji.
4.4.4.7 Pre-root anaptyxis
In certain contexts, which are not entirely describable in morphonological or
morphotactic terms, some roots may be preceded by an excrescent vowel (mostly
/i/, sometimes /a/ or /u/), cf.
 d[u]6-i~qus7-(s)-i/bed ""he makes a house""
 d[u]8-an7-(s)-i/bed""he thinks (of someone)""
 d[i]6-i4-(t)-[i]n2-i/b™k ""I found her""
 [di]8-ba/n6-k5-(s)-u/qo-n""we see""
This process seems to be largely lexically motivated (occurring more commonly
with some roots, less commonly with others; -bed ""to make"" is quite often found
with i/); the avoidance of consonant clusters seems also to be one motivation for its
occurrence.
4.4.5 The individual position classes (morpheme slots)
This chapter discusses the various position classes of the Ket verb, mostly under
formal aspects.
4.4.5.1 R - the root morpheme
As a general rule, the root morpheme in any Ket verb form occupies the rightmost
position of the morpheme chain (followed only by an optional marker of subject
plural in position PL, confined to certain conjugational patters, cf. 4.4.5.5), all other
morphological elements being technically prefixes233. All cases, where seemingly
the root morpheme is found further left (more exactly in P7) and the R slot seems to
be occupied by an ""affix"", can be interpreted by a widespread derivational process
involving incorporation of the lexical (""content"") root element and its substitution
by a different root-morpheme in R, which, however, has gradually acquired, or is in
the process of acquiring, affix-like semantic properties. Nevertheless, it is
233
Some of them, especially the P8 feminine subject marker da-, should possibly rather be
referred to as proclitics, due to some characteristics of their behaviour.

 loan from Samoyedic (cf. Protosam. *j3jwa ""orphan""), with an adaptation of the
 initial consonant to the b- found in many kinship terms.
q⁄¿ PL q™´de~ ""sun-ray""
 The additional -d- of the plural form (or in turn its lack in the singular) is not
 explicable. A similar situation, this time with the singular showing a ""superfluous""
 dental, is present in
q⁄¿d PL q™¿~ ""bow (weapon)""
 The semantic distance between these latter two words is considerable, but may be
 reconcilable, so they both may in fact be etymologically related.
 Two nouns seem to use a suffix -j to form their plural (Werner 1997c, 97), viz.:
se¿s PL sŒj (also with tone-change) ""larch"", and
 the root *ba/™, found in the compounds:
dóba ""a.k.o. fish-weir"" PLdòb⁄j
síkba ""a.k.o. fish-weir""PL síkb™j
 They are, however, best treated as instances of suppletivism.
 4.1.1.2.4.9 Functions of the plural
 Plural nouns denote the plurality of an object; as sentential subjects, they trigger
 plural forms of verbs114; unsuffixed plurals betray their inherent number by plural
 agreement; attributive numerals require the plural form of nouns (cf. 4.3.1):
(7)
áb-a~ta ké~assel
I-ADESS bird
I have a bird
(8)
áb-a~ta ké~asse-n
I-ADESS bird-PL
I have several birds

 Plural agreement is only found with animate subjects.

"Thus, candidates for verbs forms filling all ten morpheme positions may at best be
found in transitive conjugation III verbs, where both subject slots (P8 and P6) are
filled by default and one further object marker is needed204. If P4 is occupied by
(lexical) ""thematic"" /a/, we would have to look for verb forms which either:
fill P3 with a (neuter) object morpheme (/b/) and P1 with something else, or
fill P1 with a (1st or 2nd person) object morpheme and P3 with something else.

4.1.2.3.4 Complex nominal compounds
Determining elements in nominal compounds may be complex. Thus, adjectival
compounds consisting of several elements (cf. 4.1.3.5.3) may attach to a nominal
head to form an adjective-noun compound. Such heavy complexes are on the fringe
between attributive syntagms and true compounds. Prosodically, they behave like
compounds, e.g.:
ho¿l ""long"" + huut ""tail"" + t–b ""dog""  hólhuttib ""a dog with a long tail""
The one-word-status of such complex compounds is evidenced by the fact that they
may accept a possessive prefix (cf. 4.1.1.4):
na-hólhuttib
our-long.tailed.dog (Werner 1998, 58)
If we symbolize the scope of the various determining elements in this formation by
brackets, we arrive at a layered structure:
na-((hol-hut)-tib)
4.1.3 Adjectives
In distributional terms, adjectives in Ket may be defined as the class of non-
verbal145 words, which may be used attributively to modify a noun.
This means that the class of nouns proper contains only items, which may not be
used to modify other nouns; so, for example, it is ungrammatical in Ket to use a
noun as a modifier of another noun146:
143
Werner (2002, 372) thinks the determiner in this compound represents a nominal root
meaning ""light, sun-light"", but the basis for this assumption remains unclear.
144
Attested is qónoks, ""silver fir"".
145
This is an important disclaimer, since finite verbs may also directly modify a noun.
However, in these cases the head noun is modified by a predication, rather than a quality,
and we will discuss this technique in the section on relative clauses in Vol. II. Another
group of verbal words, which may modify a noun directly are infinitives (i.e., in many
cases, morphologically uncharacterized verb roots), to be discussed in 4.4.8.1.
146
The sufficient definition of a noun can, in this context, be kept simple: a noun is any
word, which may directly (i.e. without any intervening nominalization strategy) accept
inflectional affixes of number, case, and possession. Adjectives, as shown below, can only
take plural affixes.

" PHONOLOGY57
The first of these disyllabic contours - often referred to as the fifth ""tone"" - is
characterized by a rising tone on the first syllable, followed by a shorter, falling
contour on the second syllable:
d⁄´l-kit
h'´mba[hømïbaö]""Ewenki person, Tungus""
ásel[aïsElö] ""ski""
bóktis[bOkïtiös∆]""flintstone""
The acoustic impression is often that of a dynamic accent on the first syllable.
Werner's experimental results on the 5th contour (cf. Werner 1996, 58):
The second disyllabic contour - often called the sixth ""tone"" - shows a slightly
rising contour on the first syllable, again followed by a falling one on the second,
but this time the falling tone starts at a considerably higher point of the spectrum:
èsa~
èsa~[Eïs∆aNë]""gods""
b™`ntan [bønïtanë] ""wild duck""
dèsta~[dEsïtaNë] ""eyes""
This often produces the acoustic impression of a dynamic accent on the second
syllable. Cf. Werner's diagram (1996, 60):
58 A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
Minimal pairs showing the phonemicity of these contours are:
ásel ""snowshoe"":àsel ""ilimka-boat""
qáj~oq ""fly (n.)"":qàj~oq ""flies""
qóqbun ""cuckoo"":qòqbun ""cuckoos""
dúmkit ""small bird"":dùmkit ""small birds""
Whenever a monosyllabic stem receives some increment (a suffix or a lexical
element forming a compound), its inherent tone is cancelled, and the resulting
disyllabic word - or the leftmost two syllables of a longer word - will assume one of
the two disyllabic contours. The choice of v´v and v°v is largely unpredictable, but in
most instances the ""fifth"" contour (v´v) is found on inflected nouns. The ""sixth""
contour is considerably rarer and mostly found in (transparent and opaque)
compounds, as well as in some plural forms; disyllabic singular nouns with the
""fifth"" contour often, but not invariably, change this pattern to the ""sixth"" contour in
the plural without any additional plural marker (the opposite, singular v°v : plural v´v
does also occur, cf. 4.1.1.2.4.4 for examples).
3.1.3 Tone/accent in polysyllabic words
The assertion that any disyllabic Ket word features one of the two disyllabic
contours starting with the first (i.e. leftmost) syllable needs some refinement by
introducing the notion of phonological word (for which this rule holds) as opposed
to the morphological word (for which it does not). While the morphological word
poses no difficulties for definition (the nominal/verbal root and its affixes), a small
group of prefixes - or rather clitics - (possessive prefixes with nouns, cf. 4.1.1.4,
and personal agreement prefixes in verbs, cf. 4.4.4.1) show a behaviour, which
places them outside the scope of the phonological word.
This analysis is called for by the following facts:
a) no Ket root may begin with a consonant cluster; however, non-syllabic personal
clitics (occupying the leftmost morpheme slot P8, cf. 4.4.5.6) on consonant-initial
verbal morpheme chains may produce such clusters, as may non-syllabic
possessive
 prefixes/clitics on nouns (no other instances of initial clusters being present in the
language), e.g.67
k-t–b""your dog"" (phonetically [ktiÖpî])
d[u]8-k5-a4-d1-dij ""I grow up"" (phonetically [tkaddij])
These clusters are usually pronounced when they are not utterance-initial, i.e. when
other elements precede it; otherwise, quite often the first element is dropped.
67
 For clusters in general cf. 3.4.3, for the system of possessive prefixes cf. 4.1.1.4; P8 (and
other labels of the form Px) denotes one of the position classes of the Ket verb, in this case
the leftmost slot for personal/agreement affixes.

In conjugation III (4.4.3.3), where P6 morphemes serve only as coreferential subject
markers accompanying P8 ""D-series"" morphemes, all 3rd person P6 markers have
the shape bu, thus the contrast of number and class is neutralized.
The occurrence of P6 in conjugation IV verbs is marginal. Here, they only mark
objects/patients, but transitive verbs of conjugation class IV are very rare in Ket
(the paradigm given in 4.4.3.4 may indeed be the only good example). The fact that
only the bo-series is found in ""verbs of this type"" is certainly contingent.
Werner (e.g. 1997c, 193) explains the alternation of ba- vs. bo -suffixes as an
expression of the category of version346. The ba -series is labelled as marking
introvert version, whereas bo-verbs encode extrovert actions/processes. Extrovert
verbal contents describe actions/processes, which spatially ""transcend"" the
immediate sphere of the actant: most typically, they entail some spatial
dislocation/movement ""away"" from the actant or the ""scene"" the narration is
focussed on. Thus, introvert ba -verbs are more likely to describe processes of
approaching, remaining within the scene, or non-lasting changes of state, whereas
extrovert bo-verbs are often found for processes, which envolve movement away,
disappearing, or permanent changes of state (Werner 1997, 193ff.).
Recall (cf. 4.4.5.4.1) Vajda's claim that the ba-/bo-distinction is basically due to the
labializing effect of one certain determiner (k ), provisionally referred to as
""ablative"" /k /. The functions Vajda ascribes to this morpheme square well with
Werner's notion of extrovert version. However, this reinterpretation does not
necessarily render Werner's observations on ba -/bo - irrelevant or wrong. The
functional content (be it of a contextually independent bo-series of P6 affixes, or of
a labializing P5/6 determiner) of ""extroversion"" seems to be reasonably clear (but
note the exceptions mentioned in 4.4.5.4.1), at least defendable. What is less clear,
though, is the question, whether we should speak of a systematic opposition of
verbal markers, or, in other words, a functional category of ""version"" in the Ket
verb. The weak leg of such an assumption is certainly the ""introvert"" character of
the ba-series, which, as numerous examples show, seems to be as much compatible
with ""extrovert"" meanings as with ""introvert ones"".
P6 markers are subject to the following morphotactic rules:
345
Natural context: ""some object is kept in some place during the night"". Example given by
Werner 1997c (193).
346
This term was borrowed from Kartvelian/Georgian linguistics (kceva), where it refers to
a set of morphological markers, which add directional or beneficial semantic nuances to a
given verb form (i.e. whether the verbal action/process is directed towards/beneficial for a
3rd person indirect object [sasxviso], the speaker himself [sataviso], or not [saarviso]).

4.4.8Nominal verb forms
4.4.8.1Infinitive and participle
Morphologically unmarked verbal roots may be used independently, i.e. as
prosodically and grammatically autonomous words, to fulfil a variety of functions,
which invite the functional label of an ""infinitive"" form. Some uses of these semi-
nominal forms may justify the term ""participle"" as well416.
We refer to Ket infinitives as ""semi-nominal"" in character, because, in terms of
morphological behaviour, they participate in some, but not all, characteristics of
both substantive nouns and adjectives. Thus, like substantive nouns (and unlike
adjectives), infinitives may accept possessive prefixes (4.1.1.4). They also may take
case suffixes, but apart from the translative suffix -esa~ (4.1.1.3.11), there are few
unambiguous cases417.
And like adjectives (contrary to substantive nouns), Ket infinitives may be used
attributively and accept the nominalizing suffix -s (4.1.2.1). Examples for these
behavioural characteristics will be given in the remainder of this section, but we
will begin with the most verb-like use of these forms, i.e. as a complement of verbs
(and particles) of intent, movement, ceasing, and a few other ""complementable""
verbs418; the following is a fairly representative assortment of verbs/expressions,
which take infinitive-complements:
a) ability:
With the verb et IItr (a) (in) (ba/t) ""to be able to, to know how to""419:
416
Generally, we use only the term infinitive in this grammar, though.
417
In other words, the Ket infinitive is no fully declinable ""gerund"". ""Unambiguous"" means
that it is not easy to draw a clear-cut boundary between infinitive forms and outright
substantive nouns with the same shape. Thus, i¿l may be treated as the verbal infinitive
meaning ""to sing, singing"", as in, e.g. i¿l náda ""it is necessary to sing, one has to sing"" (cf.
the finite verb il Itr (il): di8-b3-il ""I sing it"", [di]8-b3-il2-il ""I sang it""), and concrete nouns
like i¿l ""song"", with its full morphological noun-like potential (including a plural éla~).
Many, but by no means all, verbal infinitives are formally identical with nouns in this way.
This may raise the question, whether concrete nouns have been dragged into the verbal
system (first, maybe, as P7 incorporates, which position may host nouns and infinitives
alike), or whether we are dealing with nominalized verbal roots here. In the absence of
overt morphological material, which would clearly differentiate both ""avatars"" of roots
with similar shape and content, there seems to be no simple answer to this question. In
some cases, lexical etymology might help, thus, if i¿l is indeed a loan from early Turkic ˜r
""song"" (and I am confident that it is, already at the Yenisei-Ostyakic stage), the concrete
noun would be primary. But this should probably not be rashly generalized to all cases of
noun-infinitive homonymy.
418
Apart from these independent uses, the most natural habitat of infinitive forms is slot P7
of complex verbs, cf. 4.4.5.2.1.4.
419
The subject of this verb is always 3rd SG impersonal, 4.4.5.6.2, and the person being
able to do something is construed as its object. The surface form given here <dabátavet>
could of course also invite a parsing with a R element bed ""to make""; that this is wrong, is
illustrated by preterite forms like <dabatómnet> da8-ba/t6-o4-b3-[i]n2-et, which show clearly
that we are dealing with b3 here.

4.4.4.2.10 Truncation Rule 10 (TR 10)
The P2 preterite markers il/in lose their vowel immediately after any vowel. Note
that this vowel may not be the inherent vowel of any P8 subject marker. In these
configurations, it is the P8 vowel, which gets truncated, according to TR 1.
That this is the case, is shown by the following set of examples:
a) a form like [""dil∆l∆okN] ""I shivered"" could in principle be analyzed as either
di8-[i]l2-loq~
i.e. with the preterite marker truncated directly after a vowel, or as
 d[i]8-il2-loq~
with truncation of the P8 person marker.
The second person singular form, however, shows that only the second analysis can
be correct:

inserted between the two vowels (for which see SR 6); (P1-RV(≠/a/)):

Though the phonetic basis of these suprasegmental entities is not uniform (while all
tonemes are characterized by a specific contour, other features like
creakiness/glottal stop and vowel length play a significant and perceptively salient
role in distinguishing these units from one another), their status as suprasegmentals
is enhanced by the fact that their distinctive features (including length and
creakiness/glottal stop) are only relevant as long as the tone-bearing unit/lexeme
remains an isolated monosyllable; upon suffixation (and, within limits, prefixation)
all58 of these features are cancelled59, giving way to one of two disyllabic contours,
58
Some deviations from this general principle are outlined in the following lengthy
footnote (dealing with cases we chose not to reflect in our transcription).
59
 This is a general observation. Werner (1996, 66ff.) observes cases, where the inherent
tone of one element of a compound may be percieved as intact, such as (our transcription)
d–kit ""young eagle"" (< d– ""eagle"", with preservation of tone 1), ask™¿t ""fairy tale"" (tone 2
preserved, possibly from k™¿t ""child""; if pluralized, the glottal segment is, however, lost,
and the expected disyllabic contour appears: ásk™ta~), aa~bes ""to become hot"" (tone 3
preserved from aa~ ""hot""), or the numerous cases, where Central and Northern Ket display
an ""additional"" vowel in fourth (and, to a lesser degree, in first) tone words (which are as a
rule monosyllabic in Southern Ket). All these cases violate the rule that non-monosyllables
show disyllabic contours, rather than full-fledged tone on their ""basic"" syllable. However,
the author's fieldwork showed such cases to be rare and usually confined to overdistinct
(""explaining"" or ""teaching"") speech, and may just represent an ""iconic"" reintroduction of
the inherent syllabic tone of a monosyllable into one or some of its compounds. On the
other hand, this observation may be due to language attrition, cf. Vajda 2001, 20, who says
(in the context of the proper investigation of the effect of intonation on lexical pitch) that
""such a study may now be only possible with the aid of archived tape recordings of
monolingual native speakers"". Throughout this grammar, we will write Ket non-
monosyllables as containing disyllabic (""accent-like"") contours and extend this practice -
for the sake of a unified description - also to lexical items cited from dictionary sources.
Thus, we will give ""mud"" as ált™q, whereas users of Werner's comparative dictionary
(2002) will find this word rendered as (his notation) 1a…l∞t™q, or húttus ""having a tail"" vs.
Werner's 3hu:ttus ∞; there are no doubts that Werner's rendering is a most faithful
reproduction of the phonetic reality of these words in his recordings (though he repeatedly
asserts that the replacement of inherent tone by disyllabic contours is, after all, the rule in
the language, cf. also Werner 1996, 65ff., where several examples of this kind are given,
often confirmed by cognate Yugh words). We have to leave open, whether this discrepancy
is due to language change/attrition (which would require a more involved description of the
""earlier"" system, where independent tone would have been possible in derived disyllables),
or to any kind of observational or descriptional inaccuracy (which, in case of doubt, will

times (certainly not generally) observe that at least the glottal segment characteristic of it

3.1.2).
The domain of Ket tones is thus the leftmost two syllables of a word.
The articulatory features of the monosyllabic tones in Southern Ket are:
Tone 1:
Even or slightly rising, vowel-length half-long:
 aÖaÖ
[a·î], [a·ü]

!l[uÖlî], [uÖlü]""water""

Œn[eÖnî], [eÖnü]""now""
¡b[oÖpî], [oÖpü]""father""
#k[´Ökî], [´Ökü]""thou""
Tone 2:
Shortly rising, then abruptly falling, accompanied by pharyngeal
constriction, vowel length short60:

[a/ÿ]
du¿t [du/tÿ]""awl""
i¿n[i/nÿ]""needle""
h⁄¿l [h¨/lÿ]""clear""

ke¿d [kE/tÿ]""human""
qo¿j [qO/jÿ]""a mythical boat""
q™¿t [qø/tÿ]""garbage""
""fairy tale"" mentioned above); I am, however, unable to hear any tone 2 contour on this
syllable. Vajda, too, observes a certain propensity of this glottal element to escape deletion
in disyllables, as long as it occurs at the right fringe of the word (Vajda 2001, 14).

only the ""high-falling"" part of the tone curve.

4.4.6.2.1 Imperatives in conjugation I
Intransitive conjugation I verbs are among the simplest of Ket verb forms; P8
subject markers389 are dropped, P2 il or in are retained, and the imperative formula
can be given as:
 (P7)-(P5)-(a4)-P2-R-(PL)
Without any lexical elements other than R, the maximally simple imperative form
consists of P2 il/in and the root:
 il2-kak""pull it !""
Transitive conjugation I verbs are built alike, but they retain (animate) object
markers in P4 and P1, respectively; P3 object b is, though, generally dropped; a form
without any object marker is thus interpreted as ""VERB it !"":

4.4.6.2.2 Imperatives in conjugation II
There are no imperatives formed from conjugation II intransitives391. Transitive
conjugation II imperatives contain object markers in P6:
389
I.e. the logically expectable P8 2nd person marker k u8. Imperatives may, cross-
linguistically, not be expected to contain a 2nd person subject marker; however,
""coreferential"" 2nd person markers are retained in those conjugation classes, which have
them. In this respect, we may be allowed to say that other imperative forms ""drop"" those
markers (cf. below).
390
The presence of the (a)-seperator in this form is irregular. It is highly likely that it serves
to emulate the -an-sequence of the 3rd SG object form.
391
Vajda/Zinn 2004 (p. 185 and 219) list two such forms, ku/k6-in2-qut (Pl. k™~/[k]6-in2-
qut) from qut IIitr (b) (in) bo/k ""to faint"", and ku/k6-a4-b3-in2-den (Pl. k™~/[k]6-a4-b3-in2-den)
from tn ~ den IIitr (a) (in) bo/k ""to run out (once)"". However, these are most likely simply

4.4.6.2.3 Imperatives in conjugation III
In intransitive conjugation III imperatives, the ""coreferential"" P6 subject marker -
for the 2nd person, obviously - is retained throughout:
 ej7-ku/k6-a4-[i]l2-[k]il ""bundle up!""
 ej7-k™~/[k]6-a4-[i]l2-[k]il-n
 tukun7-ku/t6-a4-[i]l2-kit""comb!""
 tukun7-k™~/t6-a4-[i]l2-kit-n
However, imperatives of conjugation III verbs are not numerous; some verbs of this
class form their imperative according to a different conjugational pattern; thus, e.g.,
the imperative forms of
 ej7-daq IIIitr (a) (b) (in) (ba/k) ""to throw oneself down""
 k[u]8-ej7-ku/k6-a4-b3-daq""you throw yourself down""
is clearly formed according to the imperative pattern of conjugation I392:
 ej7-k5-a4-[i]n2-daq""throw yourself down!""
 ej7-k5-a4-[i]n2-daq-n
preterite indicative forms of the respective verbs (""faint"" being an unlikely candidate for
imperative formation in the first place). Only the lack of b 3 is reminiscent of imperative-
like behaviour. Vajda (p.c.) is now inclined to view these forms as erroneously labeled.
They are not imperatives, but preterite indicatives, which were accompanied by the
optative particle qƒn (cf. 4.4.6.3.2) in the original context.
392
And, for these forms, which lack any morphological material in P6, the verbal formula
would have to be restated as k5-daq Iitr (a) (in).

Given these facts, the strictest application of traditional structuralist phonemic
principles would of course require the recognition of more vocalic phonemes.
However, our decision not to reflect this in our transcription is motivated by the
attempt to steer a middle course between the aim to transcribe Ket as phonemically
as possible, but at the same time not to overcomplicate typography. Consequently,
we regard [E], [O], [ø] and [œ] as marginal phonemes of the Ket language, which
are not recognized in our transcription.
Since for the mid-vowels the open quality is by far the most frequently encountered

Note that the assimilatory influence of 2nd person subject is not repeated by 2nd
person object morphemes in P1.
The numerous complex verbs containing the root √bed ""to do, make"" show this
alternation rather unpredictably. In many verbs it is altogether absent (i.e. only the
variant bed occurs in all forms); other compound verbs with this root show a
tendency to use the variant -ked with 2nd person subject (here the assimilatory
influence of the 2nd person P8 subject marker ku is felt again), and in imperatives,
cf.:

il7-[i]n2-i/ked ""breathe (ipv. SG)""

All other forms use the root shape -bed.
Some verbs extend the velar-initial variant to 1st person subjects, too (though
restricted to plural forms); this is true for three different interrogative verbs which
express the meanings ""to do what?"" and ""to make what [out of some material]?""
(these may, then, have exerted some analogical influence on each other248); all
other forms of the following verbs use bed.

As a general tendency, it can be said that the variant ked is most frequently found in
imperative forms, quite commonly found with 2nd person (mostly plural) forms, and
rarely present in 1st person (only plural) verb forms built with the R -bed.

4.4.5.6.1 P8 actant morphemes - the ""D-series""
The actant morphemes filling this leftmost slot of the Ket verb are widely referred
to as the ""D-affixes"" or the ""D-series"" of the person-differentiating markers of the
language (as opposed to the ""B-affixes"", which occupy position P6, cf. 4.4.5.7).
P8 is filled in all conjugation classes337 (save the ""possessive"" conjugation V); it is
obligatorily present in active verbs of conjugation I, transitive verbs of conjugation
II and all verbs of conjugations III and IV, which makes P8 morphemes the most
frequent person markers in Ket. They strictly encode actant (subject) person only,
with number being expressed by the subject plural morpheme in PL, or lack
thereof:
1st persondi
2nd personku
3rd person mdu
3rd person f/nda
P8 morphemes are routinely - and very often - affected by morphotactic rules,
which may reduce their phonetic substance by syncopating their vowel element or
eliding them completely. These morphotactic rules are:
TR 1, TR 2, TR 3, TR 4, TR 5, TR 6, SR 1, SR 2, SR 3.

4 Morphology
4.1Nouns and adjectives
4.1.1 Substantive nouns
Ket nouns are characterized by the categories of class (which is morphologically
covert in nominatives), number, case, and possession; these will be discussed in
this order below.
4.1.1.1 Class
Every Ket noun is a member of one of three noun classes, which may be generally
referred to as masculine, feminine, and neuter, respectively (m , f, and n ). Class
membership is morphologically uncharacterized in nominative forms, but relevant
for the choice of case suffixes and verbal agreement.
The masculine and feminine noun classes are behaviourally opposed to the neuter
class, forming the opposition animate vs. inanimate.
4.1.1.1.1 Morphological characteristics of noun classes
While both animate classes (m and f) differ in their morphological behaviour only
in the singular, and form a single class in the plural, the neuter class behaves like
the feminine in the singular, and stands out as an individual class in the plural (by
showing the same suffixes in the plural as the feminine singular). The differential
feature involves different case suffixes, or, more precisely, different genitive
suffixes , which surface in the genitive itself and those case forms (dative,
benefactive, ablative, adessive), which are formed by adding suffixes to the right of
the genitive marker. The different paradigms will be given in full in the section on
Case (4.1.1.3); here, the general scheme of class-sensitive case marking will be
given only, with those entities, which behave morphologically alike, circled:
SG PL
mm
 f
f
nn
MORPHOLOGY89
 I.e., m and f nouns receive the same suffixes in the plural (as ""animates""), but
different ones in the singular, where f and n go together, as with n plural.
Class membership is morphologically covert in nominative forms of nouns:
tìk ""snake"" (masculine, m)
be¿s""hare"" (feminine, f)
do¿n""knife"" (neuter, n)
The inherent class of nouns is only revealed in the genitive (and genitive-based)
cases, cf.:
Nom. SG tìk (m) ""snake""be¿s (f) ""hare""do¿n (n) ""knife""
Gen. SG tík-da bés-di dón-di
Gen. PL102tík-in-nabés-n-na dón-a~-di
Another discernible difference between the two (macro-) classes animate and
inanimate is the fact that only inanimate nouns may occur in the locative case
(4.1.1.3.7), and only animate nouns form a vocative (4.1.1.3.12)103.
4.1.1.1.2 Semantic characteristics of noun classes
The semantic basis and numerous aspects of the Ket (and Yeniseic) class system
are discussed in great detail in Werner (1994). Here, only a general outline and
non-exhaustive lists will be given.
The nomenclature adopted here is based on the fact that the basis of class m is
formed by nouns denoting male human beings, that of f by nouns denoting female
human beings, and that of n by nouns referring to inanimate things. With nouns for
human beings, thus, no unexpected class membership can be observed. However,
both animate classes contain names for lifeless things as well, furthermore names
for animals and plants are generally found in one of the two animate classes, but
whether they belong to class m or f is determined idiosyncratically, or, in other
words, by taxonomic parameters germane to Ket culture (or to that of Proto-
Yeniseic), which are not always reconstructible by modern scholarship.
102
Plural forms show, before the case suffix, a plural suffix, discussed in 4.1.1.2.4.1. Ket
possesses a sizable number of plural formations (suffixal and non-suffixal); in the case of
suffixal plurals the choice of -n or -~ is partly determined by class membership, but partly
overridden by phonetic constraints.
103
The observations of Toporov and Civ'jan (1968) that, in Pakulikha and Surgutikha
(Central Ket), a symmetrical four-fold class system may exist, which could be determinable
on the basis of a) the case suffix chosen, and b) the specific form of the numeral ""one"",
which accompanies a given noun, with:
inanimateq!s ""1"" + ""fem."" Genitive -di~ta
inanimate, masculine (!) q!s ""1"" + ""masc."" Genitive -da~ta
animate, masculine qo¿k ""1"" + ""masc. "" Genitive -da~ta
animate, feminineqo¿k ""1"" + ""fem."" Genitive -di~ta
could not be verified, neither by Werner (1994, 11), nor by the present author.

- plural past tense forms were, then, streamlined under the analogical influence of
singular past tense forms (with a ""reanalyzed"" P4 vowel only in the 3rd PL), where
both the 3rd SG past tense form (with its ""P4"" /o/) and the 3rd PL present tense form
(with its /a~/, there analyzed as P1, but principally reinterpretable as P4, and then
""preterite-labializable"") make themselves felt as entities exerting analogical
influence.

4.4.5.2.4 The pseudo-incorporate bin7-
A small group of mostly impersonal verbs require the P7 incorporate bin. These
verbs have in common that they mostly express that some object undergoes a
process. Usually, there is no known/knowable instigator of this process, and the
obvious etymological identity of this ""dummy"" incorporate with the
reflexive/emphatic pronoun b–n ""self"" (cf. 4.2.7) indicates that the metaphor
underlying these formations is that certain objects undergo state-changing
processes ""by themselves"" or ""of their own accord"". In most cases, the undergoer is
cross-referenced in the morpheme chain by 3rd person neuter -b3-. Many of the
attested forms display some idiosyncrasies, but some basic patterns can be
described:
 -in past tense forms, the incorporate bin7- is usually abbreviated to b7- or
bi7-; though the past tense morpheme can be either il2 or i n2 in these
verbs, a possible reason for this is the avoidance of two consecutive in-
sequences275, cf. (past tense) *bin7-b3-in2-a ""time passed"", against
attested bi[n]7-b3-[i]n2-a (<bímna>);
275
Or even the repetition of the whole sequence -bin-, as in this example; however, many
past tense forms lose b3, see below.
