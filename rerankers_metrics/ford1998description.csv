 Table 38 also shows that Emmi has no preferred word order. Clauses
rarely contain two overt NPs, but those that do may show AVO order, as in
 (8-45), OVA order, as in (8-46), AOV order, as in
(8-4i), OAV order, or QAVA order, as in (8-49).

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses

serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.

8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to

 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-
referential with the A of the verb, the 0 slot is filled by the Reflexive peripheral
pronominal af'.Ox, e.g. (8"" JJo).

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",56.83026885986328,1,0.7138321997106228,"The Benefactive suffix marks arguments beneficially affected by the
action of the verb. Within the VP, pronominal suffixes arp ordered with
respect to each other. The Benefactive suffix is ordered after the Oblique
slot and before incorporated nominals, the Adversative suffix, bound
number wordf and aspectual enclitics, e.g. (4-8) - (4-10). Ambiguity does
not arise when assigning augmented number suffixes to SIA or BEN1 when
 one is minimal and the other augmented, e.g. (4-46).
 4-46 me-kinyala
2MIN.A.IR.pick up-112.BEN
'You (one) bring it for us all.' (AD: 1)
Ambiguity does, however, arise in transitive sentences, when A,
 Oblique and Benefactive are augmented, e.g. (4-47a-c). The context is a
 mortuary ceremony involving ritual washing of people associated with the
 deceased. Speakers preferred gloss (b).

 the clause. When an animate subject is introduced or re-introduced into

which signals new information. This happens regardless of tense or
modality.
",62.00088119506836,0,0.7862215599882486,"Arguments which constitute the inner periphery of the clause (Benefactive,
Adversative) are also coded on the verb as suffixes which occupy ordered post-0
slots. Thus, an argument in 0 role always precedes one in Benefactive or
Adversative role. In a complex VP, the 0 suffix is ordered after the auxiliary
verb-stem. Benefactive is ordered after the coverb stem, preceding Adversative
which occupies the ante-penultimate VP slot.

 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.

8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",56.17755126953125,1,0.8809492063906045,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-

multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A

enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",59.84895324707031,0,0.8668431605222656,"The Benefactive suffix marks arguments beneficially affected by the
action of the verb. Within the VP, pronominal suffixes arp ordered with
respect to each other. The Benefactive suffix is ordered after the Oblique
slot and before incorporated nominals, the Adversative suffix, bound
number wordf and aspectual enclitics, e.g. (4-8) - (4-10). Ambiguity does
not arise when assigning augmented number suffixes to SIA or BEN1 when
 one is minimal and the other augmented, e.g. (4-46).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",47.01176452636719,1,0.8690721949888999," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation
(Hamilton)
 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's

most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",49.83354949951172,1,0.880276165904415,"Emmi operates on a subject versus object system for nominals, verbs and
bound pronouns. A, S and 0 are zero-marked on nominals but obligatorily coded
on verbs. This is a more consistently nominative/accusative system than that of
the typologically similar Dal:y: languages Marrithiyel, and Ngan' gityemerri,
 (a.~w~•·n Nqo-n""lq_~t'\)
 which have ergativ~case-mark.ing on nouns functioning as 'transitive subjects
 which are semantically or pragmatically marked.' (Green. 1989:49; Reid

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.
They may occur as part of tt~ verb complex, or enc}hcise to the final
element of a clause-initial constituent, or the final member of each clause

 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,

enclitics precede propositional enclitics.
",50.245262145996094,1,0.9285781810466536," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",56.24383163452149,1,0.9350086762148448," Finally, there are markers of transitivity outside the verb but inside
 the clause. When an animate subject is introduced or re-introduced into
197
discourse, the last word in the subject NP hosts adnominal enclitic nene
which signals new information. This happens regardless of tense or
modality.

we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",46.46430587768555,1,0.8546283038782393,"1.2. Linguistic we and typological singularities
 Emmi is .an Australian language of the pr~fixing, predominantly head-
 ukL ofl..a.r (~ """""":1.._ ""1 ~~ baJ'1 ~Vi._,,. ~IA-.
 marking type.Xt is primarily an agglutinating language, in that a
 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 'She was about to throw herself into the water now over there away
 from me.' (Tl:38)
 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.
They may occur as part of tt~ verb complex, or enc}hcise to the final
element of a clause-initial constituent, or the final member of each clause
constituent-phrase.
",55.981571197509766,1,0.8483439419532829,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

But Emmi, while primarily a head-marking language is also dependent-

adjectives tend to be treated in a similar way to nouns,
 in languages where there is a predominant 'dependent marking'
 pattern with syntactic function being marked on the arguments

8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

cluster is also common in Emmi, e.g. windjerre 'steal'. Hamilton's least
favoured clusters are [SON] [SON], and amongst these he sets up the

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",49.20058441162109,0,0.879974044649015,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

But Emmi, while primarily a head-marking language is also dependent-
marking. According to Dixon (1994:32),
adjectives tend to be treated in a similar way to nouns,
 in languages where there is a predominant 'dependent marking'
 pattern with syntactic function being marked on the arguments
 of a predicate.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.

and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Emmi is .an Australian language of the pr~fixing, predominantly head-
 ukL ofl..a.r (~ """""":1.._ ""1 ~~ baJ'1 ~Vi._,,. ~IA-.
 marking type.Xt is primarily an agglutinating language, in that a
 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.
They may occur as part of tt~ verb complex, or enc}hcise to the final
element of a clause-initial constituent, or the final member of each clause
constituent-phrase.
",45.96797943115234,1,0.8449984009783297," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.
",54.355865478515625,1,0.8386292165742891," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation

 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the

 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",48.260528564453125,1,0.7485312882466936,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 marking type.Xt is primarily an agglutinating language, in that a
 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",37.20322799682617,1,0.793592006838608,"The Benefactive suffix marks arguments beneficially affected by the
action of the verb. Within the VP, pronominal suffixes arp ordered with
respect to each other. The Benefactive suffix is ordered after the Oblique
slot and before incorporated nominals, the Adversative suffix, bound
number wordf and aspectual enclitics, e.g. (4-8) - (4-10). Ambiguity does
not arise when assigning augmented number suffixes to SIA or BEN1 when
 one is minimal and the other augmented, e.g. (4-46).

 mortuary ceremony involving ritual washing of people associated with the
 deceased. Speakers preferred gloss (b).

 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur

 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.
",47.92667007446289,1,0.857641508272511,"Emmi operates on a subject versus object system for nominals, verbs and
bound pronouns. A, S and 0 are zero-marked on nominals but obligatorily coded

 Emmi is .an Australian language of the pr~fixing, predominantly head-
 ukL ofl..a.r (~ """""":1.._ ""1 ~~ baJ'1 ~Vi._,,. ~IA-.
 marking type.Xt is primarily an agglutinating language, in that a
 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.
They may occur as part of tt~ verb complex, or enc}hcise to the final
element of a clause-initial constituent, or the final member of each clause
constituent-phrase.

is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.

rtedi-burrburr (back hairy) 'Hairy backed crocodile sp.'
",36.99187469482422,1,0.7967060734153625,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have

 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'

 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",47.51016616821289,0,0.8743310674653536," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.

complex NP. In (3-39), this NP is a list of juxtaposed referents:

 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

",58.14832305908203,1,0.8227435939225101,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'

which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes

that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and

Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 Chapter Three
 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",59.322364807128906,0,0.7629757666634738," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",34.54964828491211,1,0.6560536098379721,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.
\..i:u~.i\~""'1-......u.r.. ~ ~'1""""""i!. F••U•)
 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.
",47.98421859741211,1,0.7057576270239833," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.
",38.06816482543945,0,0.7073201838131672,"In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.

 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'

or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system

Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",40.28080749511719,0,0.8364464453333461," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This

obligatory components of the verb complex.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

But Emmi, while primarily a head-marking language is also dependent-

adjectives tend to be treated in a similar way to nouns,
 in languages where there is a predominant 'dependent marking'
 pattern with syntactic function being marked on the arguments

",47.27067184448242,0,0.8236258055383558," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system

Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",45.0338020324707,1,0.8781018113946845," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",45.43152618408203,0,0.8792302832538568," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the

affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",34.90441131591797,1,0.8032169328392786,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",0,0.7734700531074414,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.
\..i:u~.i\~""'1-......u.r.. ~ ~'1""""""i!. F••U•)
 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.
",35.242191314697266,1,0.8079903668695845,"Coverbs, incorporated nominals, and bound number words are all

 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.
",61.30180358886719,0,0.8442606096624344," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",64.43762969970703,1,0.922483689229065," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",0,0.7734700531074414," Of the intramorphemic consonant clusters which straddle syllable
boundaries, the most common is a homorganic nasal + stop cluster, and amongst
these, the most common clusters, in order of frequency are:
/nh/dh/;
/ngg/;
/nd/;
 /mb/.
 /nydj/ is the least frequent homorganic nasal+stop cluster.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.
",46.19562530517578,0,0.7370886986293789," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'

transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",47.600379943847656,1,0.9016486804413943,"The subs~ing of grammatical words into a longer phonological word is
pervasive in the language. Compound nouns, free pronouns, deictics, verb
complexes, and serial lconstructions all subsume grammatical word which then
lose phonolodcal independence; but remain stress-bearing.
",52.28004455566406,0,0.9270937556112622," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",53.634559631347656,0,0.9595337915721284,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.

 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

boundaries, the most common is a homorganic nasal + stop cluster, and amongst
these, the most common clusters, in order of frequency are:
/nh/dh/;
/ngg/;
/nd/;
 /mb/.
 /nydj/ is the least frequent homorganic nasal+stop cluster.
",38.01261901855469,0,0.861559036887628," Table 36 shows that propositional enclitics are ordered in relation to

agents of 'high' transitive verbs, or 'low' transitive verbs, also to subjects of

 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

" Enuni and Patjtjamalh (see Ford, 1990) do not appear to be in any
way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.
",0,0.7980449254096872," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.
",34.66971206665039,1,0.8320629510000948," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

 related language, Marranunggu, '- .-in any other Daly region language, where
 possession can only be expressed by the juxtaposition of possessor
 noun/pronowi and possessed noun. In Emmi and Menhdhe, juxtaposition is
 only one of several ways to express the possessive relation. Marking ·the
 possessor by means of a possessive pronowi is the usual way in Emmi to
 express possession of alienably possessed entities, e.g. material objects such as
 cars, e.g. (3-80) - (3-84), or food, e.g. (3-85). ~ .J.""Vo $'. '5' • 2.. ~ f• Q.O I.

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",54.91529846191406,0,0.8768096089839029," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.

languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close

common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90

In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

"Coverbs, incorporated nominals, and bound number words are all

 some earlier stage of the language, they were separate words which have
 since lost their phonological independence and been subsumed into the VP.

",34.58111572265625,0,0.8439654989337001,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",31.55127716064453,0,0.8372863888497287,"Ordered rule 4 can be formulated to account for these data: Rule 3
precedes Rule 3.
",35.8011589050293,0,0.8470132504750197," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including

two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of

",40.05784225463867,0,0.8753155162198356," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),

are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'

adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.
rtedi kul (back bent) 'hunchback; viye wedjirr '(head bad) 'trouble-maker';
rtedi-burrburr (back hairy) 'Hairy backed crocodile sp.'
",46.979713439941406,1,0.8962478179825881," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

 All intransitive auxiliaries except nme 'rise' may occur without a
coverb, but occur more frequently \\'ith coverbs. When they occur without a
coverb, auxiliaries retain their literal sense, e.g. (5-4) - (5-7).

a transitivity marker. As a signal of new information' -nene is attached to new
agents of 'high' transitive verbs, or 'low' transitive verbs, also to subjects of
intransitive verbs, whether these are two argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'come
out [for] in (3-47) or one argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'go somewhere' in (3-
48).-nene also marks new animate referents in 0 function, e.g.(3-49)- (3-51), or
in Locative case, e.g. (3-52).

 All intransitive auxiliaries except nme 'rise' may occur without a
coverb, but occur more frequently \\'ith coverbs. When they occur without a
coverb, auxiliaries retain their literal sense, e.g. (5-4) - (5-7).

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

 Possessive pronouns occur in Emmi and Menhdhe, . · · in the nearest

 related language, Marranunggu, '- .-in any other Daly region language, where
 possession can only be expressed by the juxtaposition of possessor
 noun/pronowi and possessed noun. In Emmi and Menhdhe, juxtaposition is
 only one of several ways to express the possessive relation. Marking ·the
 possessor by means of a possessive pronowi is the usual way in Emmi to
 express possession of alienably possessed entities, e.g. material objects such as
 cars, e.g. (3-80) - (3-84), or food, e.g. (3-85). ~ .J.""Vo $'. '5' • 2.. ~ f• Q.O I.
",57.09341812133789,0,0.8679655621720092," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation
(Hamilton)
 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the
tenn 'most favoured' for Hamilton's 'less marked' :

(ii) manner of articulation
 (Hamilton)

 ~ Most favoured in Cini!
(Emmi)

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

",58.194942474365234,0,0.8814437245266248," Table 36 shows that propositional enclitics are ordered in relation to
each other. The directional enclitics -(e)nhdhi 'TOWARDS' and -(e)ya
'AWAY' are mutually exclusive.
",61.9334831237793,1,0.9710358646826752," But in Emmi,-nene, 'New Information' cannot accurately be described as
a transitivity marker. As a signal of new information' -nene is attached to new
agents of 'high' transitive verbs, or 'low' transitive verbs, also to subjects of
intransitive verbs, whether these are two argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'come
out [for] in (3-47) or one argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'go somewhere' in (3-
48).-nene also marks new animate referents in 0 function, e.g.(3-49)- (3-51), or
in Locative case, e.g. (3-52).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",1,0.821215291273923," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",34.28626251220703,1,0.8787977415893934," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.
yuwanya+ngamen+mede ('juwapal)amenmede] \hose two men and one
 woman in the distance;
 yawanya+nemen+nganya ['jawapanemern:iapa) \hose four or more women
 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.
",44.69218444824219,0,0.797255688426564,"In (6-96), gumbVi is co-referential with the person ordered to do
something, so it is cross-referenced with Reflexive pronominal marking.
 The same obligatory cross-referencing exists in Marrithiyel (Green,
 1989:263).

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.
",47.77935409545898,0,0.773275186866453," But in Emmi,-nene, 'New Information' cannot accurately be described as
a transitivity marker. As a signal of new information' -nene is attached to new
agents of 'high' transitive verbs, or 'low' transitive verbs, also to subjects of
intransitive verbs, whether these are two argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'come
out [for] in (3-47) or one argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'go somewhere' in (3-
48).-nene also marks new animate referents in 0 function, e.g.(3-49)- (3-51), or
in Locative case, e.g. (3-52).

 All intransitive auxiliaries except nme 'rise' may occur without a
coverb, but occur more frequently \\'ith coverbs. When they occur without a
coverb, auxiliaries retain their literal sense, e.g. (5-4) - (5-7).
",54.22114562988281,0,0.7931990996749133," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.
",35.01176071166992,1,0.9105161108673108," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",51.43547821044922,0,0.8496111030944399," Table 36 shows that propositional enclitics are ordered in relation to
each other. The directional enclitics -(e)nhdhi 'TOWARDS' and -(e)ya
'AWAY' are mutually exclusive.
",53.43670272827149,1,0.8882510397305783," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",46.78842544555664,0,0.7830183776515443," Classifiers, but not noun classes, may be used in different ways

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective

may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly

earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.
",53.40982818603516,0,0.7931990996749133," Enuni and Patjtjamalh (see Ford, 1990) do not appear to be in any
way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system

",24.859731674194336,1,0.8365093808259249," Enuni and Patjtjamalh (see Ford, 1990) do not appear to be in any
way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

 3-60mama=nbdhangany=gu

'My mother really, that was.' (T10:164)
As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.
",0,0.821215291273923,"Constituents of bahuvrihi compounds in Emmi are ordered like
adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.
rtedi kul (back bent) 'hunchback; viye wedjirr '(head bad) 'trouble-maker';
rtedi-burrburr (back hairy) 'Hairy backed crocodile sp.'
",32.80510711669922,1,0.8900431659491069," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.
",43.91245269775391,1,0.8311835904159449,"Used as a propositional enclitic, -(e)no functions as a purposive marker.

 llO
3-26awa=no ngammani=no
meat=DAT J/2MIN.S.walk=PURP
'Let's both go for meat!' (RY:2)
In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.
With either construal, the meaning of (3-25) and (3-26) remains the same,

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",42.65388107299805,0,0.913826544009167," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation

 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the
tenn 'most favoured' for Hamilton's 'less marked' :

(ii) manner of articulation
 (Hamilton)

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)

attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

existence of two phonemic :fricatives. It shows how the stress patterns of

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences

attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these

",48.12688064575195,0,0.8719872536782626," Enuni and Patjtjamalh (see Ford, 1990) do not appear to be in any
way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,

introduced into the discourse for the first time by the enclitic -nene. In the first
sentence, the NP kandu nimbugurriny=nene 'your man' is the new subject of
the intransitive verb mi-come out'. The subject of the second, verb-less,

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.

 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
