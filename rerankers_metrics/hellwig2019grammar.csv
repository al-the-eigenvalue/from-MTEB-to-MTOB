"220 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
(1) a. kanes

 ‘he shouted’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER1-0050)
b. demiika qataqamunget

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).
(2) a. dianeberltiq amadaqa
 de=iane=berltik [ama=da-ka]OBJ
 CONJ=3DU.SBJ.NPST=loosen:SIDE ART=taro-SG.M
 ‘and they pick (lit. loosen) a taro’ (N12BAMCAT-090)
b. de berltiq iagel
 de berltik [ia-igel]OBJ
 CONJ loosen:SIDE other-SG.EXC
 ‘and another one got loosened’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-039)
While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",5,1.0," The order of elements in a clause is fixed. Verbal clauses have a constituent order
of AVO ~ SV: this order is unexpected from a Papuan perspective, but it is commonly
found in Oceanic and non-Oceanic languages of New Britain and New Ireland. The
non-verbal locative construction also shares the order of the subject preceding the
predicate. In addition, Qaqet has two constructions that exhibit the reversed order of
the predicate being followed by the subject: the non-verbal equative and attributive
constructions.
",43.16153717041016,5,1.0," Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).
(1) a. asiitka qerarles
 a=siit-kake=rarles
 NM=story-SG.M 3SG.M.SBJ.NPST=start.NCONT

b. buv aarlaunini

c. samabarl lungera
 sa=ama=barl lu-nget-a
 already=ART=big DEM-N-DIST
 ‘that one is already big’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-265)
In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

"228 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

‘[that one]SBJ was carrying [this one]OBJ up there’ (C12ARBZJIFROG-431)
Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

",52.2160530090332,5,1.0,"8 Clauses
This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.
Tab. 75: Clause structure
1 Conjunction(s) see section 8.3
2 Particle(s)see chapter 7
3 Subjectsee chapter 5.2.1
4 Verb see chapter 5
5 Direct objectsee chapter 5.2.1
6 Prepositional object(s) (entailed by verb semantics) see chapter 5.3
7 Prepositional phrase(s), Relational noun(s), Adverb(s) see chapters 5.3, 6.1, 6.2
8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of

 Another shared areal pattern is clausal constituent order (Dunn, Reesink, and
Terrill 2002: 32–33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743): Qaqet has AVO ~ SV constituent
order, i.e., it differs from the verb-final order otherwise widespread in (East) Papuan
languages. This order is found in all clause types (affirmative and negative state-
ments, questions and commands), and it is also found in one non-verbal construction
(the locative construction). In addition, there are two non-verbal constructions (the
equative and attributive constructions) that exhibit the reversed order of the predi-
cate being followed by the subject.
",63.902950286865234,5,1.0," Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

",69.5203857421875,5,1.0," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.
Tab. 75: Clause structure

2 Particle(s)see chapter 7
3 Subjectsee chapter 5.2.1

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.

predicate. In addition, Qaqet has two constructions that exhibit the reversed order of
the predicate being followed by the subject: the non-verbal equative and attributive
constructions.

the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",63.33635330200195,5,0.6960665467587214," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

",68.04334259033203,5,1.0," Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).
(1) a. asiitka qerarles
 a=siit-kake=rarles
 NM=story-SG.M 3SG.M.SBJ.NPST=start.NCONT
 ‘the story starts’ (N11AJNGENAINGMETSIQI-0001)
b. buv aarlaunini
 bup aa=rlaun-ini
 fill 3SG.M.POSS=netbag-SG.DIM
 ‘his netbag gets filled’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER1-0011)
c. samabarl lungera
 sa=ama=barl lu-nget-a
 already=ART=big DEM-N-DIST
 ‘that one is already big’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-265)
In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-

clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

" Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

 Another shared areal pattern is clausal constituent order (Dunn, Reesink, and
Terrill 2002: 32–33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743): Qaqet has AVO ~ SV constituent
order, i.e., it differs from the verb-final order otherwise widespread in (East) Papuan
languages. This order is found in all clause types (affirmative and negative state-
ments, questions and commands), and it is also found in one non-verbal construction
(the locative construction). In addition, there are two non-verbal constructions (the
equative and attributive constructions) that exhibit the reversed order of the predi-
cate being followed by the subject.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).

8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.

common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

 CONJ loosen:SIDE other-SG.EXC
 ‘and another one got loosened’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-039)
While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",47.78793716430664,5,1.0," Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

 ‘that one is already big’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-265)
In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

",68.56425476074219,5,1.0," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.

verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

" Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",1,0.9137686763803912," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and

ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the

 Another shared areal pattern is clausal constituent order (Dunn, Reesink, and

order, i.e., it differs from the verb-final order otherwise widespread in (East) Papuan
languages. This order is found in all clause types (affirmative and negative state-
ments, questions and commands), and it is also found in one non-verbal construction
(the locative construction). In addition, there are two non-verbal constructions (the
equative and attributive constructions) that exhibit the reversed order of the predi-
cate being followed by the subject.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

 ‘and another one got loosened’ (LONGYJL20150805_1-039)
While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",65.8077392578125,5,1.0," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",67.11770629882812,4,0.9784421690950976," Example (1a) illustrates the intransitive SV order, while (1b) illustrates the one
potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",48.190086364746094,5,0.9765874813724074,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-

",47.05147171020508,5,1.0," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",52.65086364746094,0,0.8922108454754891," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

",60.516483306884766,5,1.0,"8 Clauses
This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.
Tab. 75: Clause structure
1 Conjunction(s) see section 8.3
2 Particle(s)see chapter 7
3 Subjectsee chapter 5.2.1

7 Prepositional phrase(s), Relational noun(s), Adverb(s) see chapters 5.3, 6.1, 6.2
8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.

mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",60.49208068847656,4,0.9033445708590728," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO2-039)
The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",46.50128555297852,4,0.9816749111390471," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally

For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.
Tab. 75: Clause structure
1 Conjunction(s) see section 8.3
2 Particle(s)see chapter 7
3 Subjectsee chapter 5.2.1
4 Verb see chapter 5
5 Direct objectsee chapter 5.2.1

7 Prepositional phrase(s), Relational noun(s), Adverb(s) see chapters 5.3, 6.1, 6.2
8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",5,0.8773314525245743," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

of AVO ~ SV: this order is unexpected from a Papuan perspective, but it is commonly

predicate. In addition, Qaqet has two constructions that exhibit the reversed order of
the predicate being followed by the subject: the non-verbal equative and attributive
constructions.

ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",61.16035461425781,5,0.7862066257668222,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",58.50154113769531,0,0.9033426145863744," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

",52.36323928833008,0,0.8105351338581519," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

2 Particle(s)see chapter 7

8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",46.39019012451172,5,0.9831371531488228," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",51.112186431884766,1,0.761750126241788,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",53.65384292602539,1,0.8460643604976738," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).
",52.284793853759766,4,0.9840410922875104,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of

structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",59.177772521972656,1,0.8460643604976738," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",66.121826171875,5,0.9819799982695264," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

",5,0.8987290098728798," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",39.46358489990234,1,0.8731011440563117," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",49.99935150146485,1,0.8695166862231695," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",61.15681076049805,1,0.755419181795196,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",58.20625305175781,0,0.8514752768898525," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",58.84758758544922,4,0.9239349970480174," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

potential exception to this order: the agentless construction. This construction could
be analyzed as exhibiting VS constituent order. However, as discussed in chapter
Simple clauses | 411
5.2.2, there are reasons to not adopt this analysis and to instead assume a VO constit-
uent order. With respect to non-verbal clauses, there is more variation, including two
constructions whose subject follows the predicate (e.g., the attributive construction
exemplified in 1c) (see section 8.2).

In transitive clauses, a direct object follows immediately after the verb (as in 2a). Re-
call that Qaqet makes widespread use of prepositions to introduce semantic argu-
ments of a verb (see chapter 5.3): such arguments also follow the verb (as in 2b). Qaqet
does not have any ditransitive verbs, but there are trivalent verbs that introduce ar-
guments through prepositions. In such cases, the unmarked direct object precedes
the prepositional phrase (as in 2c). If a prepositional phrase introduces a participant
that is not entailed by the verb semantics, it follows to the right (as in 2d).

",46.51087951660156,0,0.8489232600822368,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",52.18228530883789,5,0.8357679439236585," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",55.58515167236328,0,0.9425828729221734," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",39.81303405761719,1,0.8774640015384841,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",46.31340026855469,5,0.9984596511388274,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",53.63468551635742,5,0.869257184442242,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",52.03042602539063,0,0.9275402798418352," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-

neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.

of AVO ~ SV: this order is unexpected from a Papuan perspective, but it is commonly
found in Oceanic and non-Oceanic languages of New Britain and New Ireland. The
non-verbal locative construction also shares the order of the subject preceding the
predicate. In addition, Qaqet has two constructions that exhibit the reversed order of
the predicate being followed by the subject: the non-verbal equative and attributive
constructions.

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.

8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",58.07777786254883,5,0.8722997584476813," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",58.78748321533203,4,0.9279096921153844," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",63.74965286254883,1,0.8913286246697658," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced

ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.

The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index

indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).

there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",55.13942337036133,4,0.9455831432557288," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

",39.011985778808594,2,0.8739399636332944," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",49.35614013671875,1,0.7965230355173852,"228 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",57.91491317749024,5,0.7798648943500885," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",58.22980499267578,4,0.9313702906706802," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).
",63.614994049072266,4,0.8965452483117639," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",65.38223266601562,1,0.8968675662379937," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

",45.35592651367188,4,0.7742081062887094," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",46.40481185913086,5,0.8756918061584281," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).
",51.541297912597656,5,0.8762587983944221," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index

indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",50.51814270019531,5,0.7332195814303248," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",52.232025146484375,4,0.8322916440627587," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

" The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",35.02019119262695,1,0.7990488576257607," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",50.79804611206055,0,0.7856707272527902," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",45.053688049316406,4,0.7842420670435445," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",50.3760986328125,5,0.7561847745272287,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",52.20514678955078,1,0.8064151991277384," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",51.38740539550781,4,0.8560068351747224," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",57.723426818847656,4,0.8053416127095893," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",62.1660041809082,1,0.915666813498253,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-

occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",60.19862365722656,0,0.7029248495045682," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",57.12271881103516,4,0.8446707048361056,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

",57.00603103637695,0,0.9074294652658408," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",57.55242156982422,4,0.8134010232684125,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

" The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from

such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",57.00598907470703,0,0.6965990611210056," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",59.63471603393555,4,0.7144463741156635," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",56.61092376708984,4,0.850694871765148,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).
",34.29658126831055,5,0.7847383518339107," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

",50.767677307128906,4,0.8501022960764927,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",53.87333679199219,0,0.8733383067760556,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers

in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-

jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-

copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155

comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

NM=person=ART=threefrom/with-3PL.H
‘there is a story here, it goes to [th.. three people]NP’ (R12ABDFROG-
001FF)
Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",68.1113510131836,1,0.7984793865228658," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",68.87709045410156,4,0.8425559955793536
" As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",4,0.8237324681377226," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",38.212013244628906,0,0.780848395211635," Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 71
In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",56.55093765258789,1,0.6802991450647289,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the
||
38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",59.022605895996094,1,0.697495069086663," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-

",34.09177780151367,1,0.7652215390912103,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).
",42.68353271484375,5,0.7512063999951984," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",47.73017883300781,0,0.7044761841856771," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",49.98160171508789,0,0.8190753699774689," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-

ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",44.61127471923828,4,0.860660268078566," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",49.6707878112793,4,0.7267591020622423," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",51.05323028564453,1,0.7727382057660996,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",50.956092834472656,5,0.8151626574692235,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",56.34812545776367,1,0.8868938352407828," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

ositional objects (as in 41c).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-

the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive

copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

This chapter introduces the different clause types: the structure of simple (verbal)
clauses (section 8.1), non-verbal clauses (section 8.2) and clause linking (section 8.3).
Section 8.4 then summarizes this chapter.
8.1 Simple clauses
Different aspects of the structure of simple clauses have been discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this grammar, and this section serves to bring together the available in-
formation on clause structure (section 8.1.1) and speech acts (section 8.1.2). The focus
of the presentation is on verbal clauses, but non-verbal clauses allow for the same
peripheral constituents, and they are negated and questioned in the same way.
8.1.1 Verbal clauses
The different constituents of a verbal clause combine in the fixed order summarized
in Table 75.
Tab. 75: Clause structure

2 Particle(s)see chapter 7
3 Subjectsee chapter 5.2.1

8 Directional(s) see chapter 6.3
In all verbal clauses, the constituent order is AVO ~ SV. This verb-medial order is a
common areal pattern in New Britain and New Ireland, and Qaqet does not exhibit
any evidence for a verb-final order, which is otherwise widespread among Papuan
languages, including East Papuan languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 32–
33, 36–37; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",57.337921142578125,5,0.8298064007611117,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

",63.81492614746094,0,0.8046397372342112," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",33.798072814941406,0,0.7517956350128255," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",49.548221588134766,1,0.7034630985840856," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",42.230770111083984,0,0.7380263932204517," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",47.50843811035156,0,0.692116064676213," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).
",44.133277893066406,4,0.8566101104807196," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",49.49155044555664,4,0.8397948348599056," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).
",58.38349914550781,5,0.7900049371122628," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in

or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-

suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",50.72402191162109,4,0.7942706617761843,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.

",56.29041290283203,4,0.9064234169810776," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",57.28764343261719,1,0.7945506399130502," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-
72 | Nouns and the noun phrase
mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",37.62251663208008,0,0.7693055571300402," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",56.28084564208984,5,0.8499167957972574," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",57.058082580566406,0,0.8227316662771309," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",61.85759735107422,0,0.8331029292484253,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers

in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",63.55594253540039,1,0.8063053329521052," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",33.63807678222656,0,0.745386001995952," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",49.420989990234375,0,0.6974655374213904," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

This section focuses on transitivity as defined above. It first describes the mor-
phosyntactic properties of subject and object (section 5.2.1), then discusses the
agentless construction (section 5.2.2) and the expression of reflexive and reciprocal
concepts (section 5.2.3), and finally outlines the distribution of intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs in the Qaqet lexicon (section 5.2.4). Following this discussion of transitiv-
ity, the next section then focuses on prepositions and their role in introducing argu-
ments.
5.2.1 Grammatical relations: Subject and object
Qaqet verbs allow for at most two unmarked arguments. The subject argument pre-
cedes the verb, covering both the subject of intransitive verbs (as in 13a) and the sub-
ject of transitive verbs (as in 13b); and the object argument follows it (as in 13b). There
are no ditransitive verbs that occur with two unmarked object noun phrases.

Both arguments are unmarked, i.e., they do not receive any case or prepositional
marking (but see section 5.3 for a discussion of prepositions). They are distinguished
on the basis of the fixed constituent order of AVO/SV (but see section 5.2.2 for a dis-
cussion of the agentless construction), and the subject argument is obligatorily in-
dexed on the verb. Note that both arguments can be freely omitted if they are recov-
erable from context. The following paragraphs discuss (i) the subject argument and
(ii) the object argument.
(i) Subject argument
The subject argument precedes the verb, and it is obligatorily indexed on it (as illus-
trated in 14a). The subject slot can be filled by all types of noun phrases, including
noun phrases headed by free pronouns (as in 14b). This section focusses on the mark-
ing of subjects through constituent order and subject indexes. For details on the dis-
tribution of noun phrases, see chapter 3.2.3; and for the forms and categories of the
subject indexes, see chapter 3.2.3 (for the person categories) and section 5.4.1 (for the
tense categories).

gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",49.395694732666016,1,0.8411607064719935,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",58.365718841552734,1,0.7917953056988571," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

",43.83141326904297,0,0.8470486024953642," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",49.35840225219727,1,0.7512373962339685,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of

structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

",56.1866569519043,1,0.9072212289504356," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",56.924278259277344,1,0.796302252905172," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",60.85149002075195,4,0.8615026149122776,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the
||
38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",63.87446975708008,1,0.8702052627908464," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",0,0.8041757008019625," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",37.60594177246094,1,0.771220262996669,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",58.77980422973633,0,0.6824016938903541," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",56.08818435668945,1,0.8511624486530196,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",56.8458137512207,1,0.8242029488720827,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",61.79914474487305,1,0.8344881329686177," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",63.5192756652832,0,0.7996132014378334," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",49.204551696777344,0,0.8341792841220528," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

",52.87529754638672,2,0.8294480884433296," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",37.80879211425781,1,0.8383671164832365," Morphosyntactic properties | 365
 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-

",50.53657150268555,2,0.7975623509255402," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",50.27889633178711,4,0.829096308510505,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

‘he is afraid of the little one’ (R12ATAFROG-126)
The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",56.14482116699219,0,0.8996915208751497," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",56.8765754699707,1,0.797992892985312,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",57.45218276977539,1,0.8258983316154092," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.
",63.81935501098633,0,0.8629827779268481," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",67.34235382080078,4,0.8024389304760291," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

 (I12ABLAJLATASOCIO3-040)
3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

",48.175052642822266,0,0.7399315316495793," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",61.4947395324707,0,0.8277357632297602,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",63.4284553527832,1,0.8012346573953487," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

",46.309844970703125,0,0.7251788499413577," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",43.31790542602539,1,0.8435342119892201," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",49.01164245605469,0,0.8274294134739827,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce

tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

‘there is a story here, it goes to [th.. three people]NP’ (R12ABDFROG-

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",56.006927490234375,1,0.9005031800374963,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",56.86493682861328,1,0.799627459880335," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.
",60.615478515625,0,0.8556718461576532," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",63.57390975952149,0,0.8559998400459955," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

",37.39670181274414,5,0.8064602504502703," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.

a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-

subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

 ‘you see this one, you see the path here’ (C12ARBZJIFROG-268)
In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",57.49134826660156,4,0.8124813433272285," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",49.98453521728516,4,0.879598594121167," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",55.70142364501953,1,0.9012891119579476,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).

there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

",57.226200103759766,4,0.8523684077709133,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

" In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.

patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the

the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",61.32390975952149,1,0.8304158855805723," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

While subject and object arguments are formally unmarked, Qaqet additionally
makes use of prepositions to introduce participants entailed by the verb semantics.
For example, the verb quarl ~ kuarl ‘present someone with something’ co-occurs with
the preposition te ‘PURP’ to convey the meaning of ‘give’ (as in 3a), and with the prep-
osition ne ‘from/with’ to convery the meaning of ‘show’ (as in 3b).

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both

structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

",42.787689208984375,0,0.8304103335939476," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",48.63848114013672,1,0.8301143020771699," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",52.45732498168945,0,0.8099361975457333,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-

phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-

this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This

egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

",50.08607482910156,0,0.8264673192427633," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",49.3143424987793,1,0.8805281075740252," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",56.592864990234375,1,0.7949068130023711," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",57.17024230957031,0,0.845788020307566," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",0,0.8187282840551443,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",36.9435920715332,0,0.8018517688252207,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",47.92700958251953,1,0.7765587536417409," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",55.945091247558594,1,0.727025653325698," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",58.44176483154297,0,0.7003369536892228," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",55.36672592163086,0,0.8326408765258013," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",63.21011734008789,0,0.8139266898364281," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",32.548274993896484,0,0.7561935994425901," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",47.365482330322266,0,0.7485654095719989," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",39.46979522705078,1,0.726358989199936," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments

chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",37.42080307006836,4,0.8582421683856374," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",42.483924865722656,4,0.8598423429513175," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",60.127723693847656,1,0.8435498191945755,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",63.27008438110352,1,0.8516491526855812,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of

structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

" The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",4,0.8422598846008442," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-

pre-head adjective translation.

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",55.4058837890625,5,0.8298119306310353," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",61.181419372558594,0,0.8180474765951112," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative

",47.25405502319336,1,0.750425250187206," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",38.4394760131836,0,0.7209861725678443," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",43.43081283569336,1,0.7182654808316227," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

",57.2880859375,2,0.8469127192229252," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",52.35897445678711,1,0.812767052401602," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",42.00481033325195,0,0.8534821611267983," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",47.22212219238281,4,0.8314436083746475," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",48.90445327758789,4,0.8512427045334566," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",49.015380859375,0,0.874910633683954," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",54.67780685424805,0,0.8885079925632603," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",57.03667831420898,1,0.848084889705675,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",60.07732772827149,1,0.8447070680839311," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",63.007442474365234,1,0.8527464914831828," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening

free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from

such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.
",36.64986801147461,0,0.7901499876460919," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",47.42774200439453,0,0.7945992345658053," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",55.7471809387207,0,0.7164158430869619," The verb lexicon contains transitive and intransitive verbs, but no ditransitive
verbs and only very few ambitransitive verbs (section 5.2.4). Both subject and object
noun phrases are formally unmarked, the constituent order is SV/AVO, and the sub-
ject argument is obligatorily indexed, usually as a proclitic on the verb (section 5.2.1).
In addition, some types of bivalent verbs occur in the agentless construction to con-
vey a non-controlled situation: the subject argument and its index are omitted, and
the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as before. This pattern resem-
bles a split-intransitive system (that distinguishes between two classes of intransitive
verbs, SA verbs and SO verbs), but there are reasons to analyze this pattern not as a
lexical split, but as an argument structure alternation (section 5.2.2). Qaqet further-
more has reflexive and reciprocal pronouns that take the place of direct and preposi-
tional objects (section 5.2.3).

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",54.072940826416016,0,0.8278330635970687," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-

patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",31.47502326965332,1,0.7597515751936117,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’

Qaqet verbs are either intransitive or transitive; there are no ditransitive verbs (in the
sense that no verb can occur with three unmarked arguments, see section 5.2 for a
discussion). The subject argument (covering the subject of both intransitive and tran-
sitive verbs) precedes the predicate, and is obligatorily indexed. The object argument
follows: if the object is pronominal, it is suffixed to the verb stem or particle; if it is
nominal, it constitutes an independent word. Qaqet thus has a fixed constituent order
of AVO/SV, whereby both subject and object arguments can be omitted. In addition,
there is an agentless construction that suppresses the A argument altogether (includ-
ing its subject index), resulting in the structure VO. The alternation between a transi-
tive AVO and an agentless VO structure is illustrated in (2a) and (2b). This phenome-
non could alternatively be analyzed as a case of split intransitivity, with some
intransitive verbs exhibiting SV order and others, VS order (see section 5.2.2 for de-
tails).

within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",42.4322509765625,1,0.8268041932845825," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",57.00693130493164,1,0.8480226264112741,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",52.3252182006836,0,0.8068743617134232," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

",41.95645904541016,1,0.8545444388141492," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",46.48269271850586,4,0.8544161472942916," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",48.74308776855469,1,0.8523212186380875," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",56.9737548828125,1,0.8491862984711754,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the
||
38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",59.49795150756836,1,0.8458329665946273,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",62.48942565917969,0,0.8465639434887826," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",65.73419952392578,1,0.8029188096675192," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

" Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in

some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative

",0,0.8302066931444217,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",36.3325309753418,1,0.7916424284590187,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",47.35097122192383,0,0.7889480920460404,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",55.588478088378906,0,0.7113207361996339," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",58.14394378662109,0,0.7212015386751734," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",53.840782165527344,0,0.8219455640608819," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",45.60039520263672,0,0.7396862616877992,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",51.98530578613281,1,0.8082478597721954,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",36.47258377075195,0,0.8397027646287911," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).
",41.73092269897461,4,0.876914731777697," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

",48.8222885131836,0,0.8623901924663953," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",62.415283203125,0,0.8405432310482989," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",65.71256256103516,1,0.8043204393772965," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",66.88397216796875,4,0.8715482154196685
" Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",0,0.8244106719620724," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",47.06776809692383,0,0.7834401144652365," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

",55.50826644897461,0,0.7063547077533416," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-
72 | Nouns and the noun phrase
mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",55.20980453491211,1,0.8263562754020598," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

",36.10702896118164,0,0.7414486997515396,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",42.25901412963867,0,0.8151927961284324," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

",51.876407623291016,1,0.8095865618998688," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",36.306583404541016,4,0.8617661253195547,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",41.2741584777832,0,0.8707926221844254," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as

cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and

clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",65.65653991699219,5,0.8336122384058171," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

",46.91985321044922,0,0.7834401144652365," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.
",55.44425201416016,4,0.7339756051364501,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met

",58.08134078979492,0,0.7161665282019719," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.
",55.03596496582031,1,0.8332614997478369," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",62.0498046875,1,0.8047524692604934," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

",42.12876129150391,2,0.8290032448199867," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",47.03742599487305,4,0.8422630561572605," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",56.63982772827149,0,0.8430946632463325," The general characteristic of all attested non-verbal clauses is the absence of a
copula or other (defective) verbal element. Instead, Qaqet relies on syntax: the exis-
tential consists of a single noun phrase, and the other constructions juxtapose subject
and predicate, whereby the order of constituents differs across the different construc-
tions. Subjects are usually noun phrases, but the equative construction marks its sub-
ject by means of a preposition. And subjects are never cross-referenced on the predi-
cate. The constructions furthermore differ in the types of predicates they admit. Table
77 summarizes the properties of each construction.
",51.82306671142578,1,0.8164917862456459," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the

occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",36.302040100097656,1,0.8686713496653318," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",41.16625213623047,1,0.8776978465302026,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",45.92560577392578,0,0.8494792650150264," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",48.2670783996582,0,0.8686006242646603," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",48.62298202514648,1,0.8632747091206289," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

",57.99991607666016,5,0.750332845731701,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).
",53.2613410949707,1,0.823040480792013," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",60.20632553100586,2,0.8212831258478142," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",61.275917053222656,0,0.8047524692604934," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",30.523136138916016,1,0.7976605845810685," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)

anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

",51.062538146972656,4,0.843824840269429,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",36.088600158691406,0,0.8686713496653318," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",40.961708068847656,4,0.9050309005539858,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

",48.02507400512695,4,0.8959336782884435,"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",55.55826568603516,0,0.886382467807351," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",61.57806015014648,1,0.8970548849794807," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",65.58980560302734,1,0.84735072625754," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",0,0.8793646233689641," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head
and pre-head adjectives with, respectively, the English post-head relative clause and
pre-head adjective translation.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-

mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.

in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article

ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-
72 | Nouns and the noun phrase
mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.

",61.15524673461914,2,0.8182827746951786,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",30.32071304321289,0,0.7976605845810685," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",41.69157409667969,1,0.7686204083503471," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

",46.41421890258789,1,0.8763612628983862,"The structure of the predicate is summarized in Table 60. The subject argument
is obligatorily indexed, with the index expressing information on person and tense.
The index is optionally followed by the modifier raqa ~ taqa ‘properly’, but is more
commonly followed directly by the verb stem. Qaqet verbs have up to three different
aspectual stems that express information about tense/aspect. The verb stem is then
optionally followed by two types of elements: verb particles and object pronouns. The
term ‘verb particle’ is used as a cover term for a large number of (diachronic) prepo-
sitions, relational nouns, adverbs and directionals, which became incorporated into
the verb, first as particles and later as suffixes. They originally served to introduce
arguments in different semantic roles, or to specify the direction or manner of a verb
action. Synchronically, they are often no longer fully analyzable and they constitute
integral parts of complex verbs with conventionalized meanings. The final slot is
filled by a suffixed pronominal form: a direct object, a reflexive or a reciprocal. This
suffix is optional: it is absent with monovalent verbs, and it is mutually exclusive with
an object noun phrase.

Examples (1a) to (1c) illustrate some of the slots of the predicate: the simplest form of
the predicate consisting of a subject index and a verb stem (in 1a), and more complex
structures including in both examples a subject index, the modifier taqa ‘properly’
and a verb stem, plus the object pronoun nget ‘3N’ in (1b) and the verb particle met
‘in’ in (1c).
",56.461219787597656,0,0.8704277172701158," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-

3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

",53.49951934814453,1,0.9111270269734402," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

",55.4852409362793,4,0.9134430786767213," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap
 dap.. [ama=qaqera-ki ama=vu-ki]NP,
 but ART=person-SG.F ART=bad-SG.F

 ‘and.. there is a bad person, they call her Sinap’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-031FF)
b. de saqika iaqamqaqraqa

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",58.03595352172852,0,0.8686375213870404," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",61.49729919433594,1,0.9038200376968232," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.
",65.33917236328125,4,0.8744113371269102," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

 ‘and he kept killing them, and he kept putting them in his little net-

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

‘sit down, and.. and.. and.. and.. and the.. uh and Bridget, she will be
looking at you’ (C12VARPLAY-437)
The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free

but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",57.68116760253906,1,0.7570334006081774," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",52.81062698364258,1,0.8365061883858318," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",54.597312927246094,0,0.8400266524651795," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",59.429805755615234,4,0.8548504980710618," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

ositional objects (as in 41c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.
",37.40907669067383,0,0.7796490245060308," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",41.39085006713867,1,0.8424689524138055," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

",34.93601608276367,4,0.8954735691712369," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",46.63984680175781,1,0.9093993858822624," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",47.5747299194336,0,0.8768731253439173," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",53.29033660888672,1,0.9178275818499164,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",55.051570892333984,0,0.9134430786767213," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",57.66329956054688,0,0.8686375213870404," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

 ‘in an abandoned garden, and then, there was a.. a Vilan (spirit)’
 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",65.29000091552734,0,0.8744113371269102," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

" Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 71
In either case, indefinite pronouns occurring as adnominal determiners, demonstra-
tives, and adjectives agree with the head in noun class and number. Other depend-
ents do not agree and have an invariable form instead. Example (6a) illustrates agree-
ment: the head noun is qaqera ‘person’, which is marked for masculine singular
(reflecting the properties of its real-world male referent Sirini) – and both the preced-
ing indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ and the following adjective tlu ‘good’ agree with
it. In almost all cases, the noun class suffix on the noun is identical in form to the
suffix on the agreeing elements, e.g., the suffix -ka ‘SG.M’ occurs both with the head
noun and the agreeing elements in (6a). The only difference is found in plural nouns
of the masculine and feminine classes: these nouns are unmarked (e.g., avet ‘house’
in 6b has plural reference), but the agreeing elements take an overt suffix, e.g., the
neuter suffix -nget ‘N’ on the adjective tlu ‘good’ in (6b) (see chapter 4 for details).

The Qaqet noun phrase is thus characterized both through agreement and a fairly
rigid structure: a fixed order of constituents, and a division between pre-head deter-
72 | Nouns and the noun phrase
mination and post-head modification (including quantification). This characteriza-
tion holds for the majority of cases, as most attested noun phrases exhibit this struc-
ture. There is, however, some variation.
",1,0.8860037962182808," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",35.56076431274414,0,0.8131762514548578,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the
||
38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).

",60.87432098388672,5,0.8581791938182385,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",29.30133438110352,0,0.7976605845810685," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

‘there is a story here, it goes to [th.. three people]NP’ (R12ABDFROG-

Different from Mali, the Qaqet modifiers thus cannot be analyzed as clauses. And I
suspect that the metalinguistic comments above reflect the word order of English ra-
ther than the underlying Qaqet structure. The comments were made by speakers who
are fluent in English, and it cannot be ruled out that they equated the Qaqet post-head

Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",55.77218627929688,0,0.8704277172701158," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in

possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",53.82686233520508,0,0.898935445563006," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap

b. de saqika iaqamqaqraqa

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",54.89687347412109,0,0.9134430786767213," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",61.19329833984375,0,0.9038200376968232," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",0,0.8860037962182808," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",35.4390869140625,0,0.8131762514548578," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following
Determination | 109
noun (as in 49b). Although, again, it is more common for the preposition to form a
clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

 ‘but [that water]NP, they cannot cross it’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0004)
Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",59.09386444091797,4,0.9143693366619304,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

Transitivity | 233
(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

",46.2115478515625,1,0.9094986978817244,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the

morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

 ‘but [that water]NP, they cannot cross it’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0004)
Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",53.73535919189453,1,0.9055161891490772," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",54.57854461669922,0,0.9134430786767213," As a consequence of its predominant verb-medial order, Qaqet does not have any
clause chaining and/or switch reference, which is common in verb-final Papuan lan-
guages. Qaqet also does not employ multi-verb constructions synchronically, and,
interestingly, there is also no clear evidence for subordination. Qaqet essentially com-
bines main clauses with each other, indicating the different semantic relationships
through a large number of conjunctions and particles.
1.4 Structure of the grammar
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 focuses on the phonology, presenting infor-
mation on segmental phonology, syllable structure and prosody. Chapter 3 is orga-
nized around the noun phrase: it starts with a general discussion of word classes and
phrase structure in Qaqet, and then discusses the possible heads of noun phrases
(i.e., nouns, numerals and quantifiers, and pronouns), their determination (by means
of demonstratives and articles) and their modification (by means of adjectives, nom-
inal modifiers and adverbials), and finally describes possessive noun phrases and
conjoined noun phrases. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of the nominal domain,
focusing on the morphology and semantics of the noun class and gender systems.
Chapter 5 is organized around the structure of the predicate. It outlines the predomi-
nant lexicalization patterns in the verbal lexicon, and then focuses on syntactic tran-
sitivity and semantic valency, discussing especially the role of prepositions in this
domain. This chapter also introduces those tense/aspect and modifier categories that
are marked within the predicate. Chapter 6 is a description of adverbials, covering
relational nouns, adverbs and directionals. Note that prepositions and prepositional
phrases are discussed in Chapter 5, and not taken up again in Chapter 6. Chapter 7
introduces the word class of particles, which plays an important role in structuring
discourse. And chapter 8 focuses on clause structure, describing verbal and non-ver-
bal clauses, clause linking as well as the structures of negative statements, questions
and commands.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

noun (as in 49b). Although, again, it is more common for the preposition to form a
clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

 3PL.SBJ=cross.NCONT.PST
 ‘but [that water]NP, they cannot cross it’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0004)
Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

 ‘in an abandoned garden, and then, there was a.. a Vilan (spirit)’
 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

" Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?
 are-ia-ki nema-ki?
",35.13972091674805,0,0.8131762514548578," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",46.04654693603516,0,0.8231674143761807," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

Left-dislocation is not restricted to participants in an event, but is also found for all
other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",51.96548080444336,1,0.8695879130427864," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",58.83293914794922,0,0.9143693366619304," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",55.10732650756836,4,0.8965278503088664,"To summarize the discussion, the locative construction expresses a locative rela-
tionship, and it can also be used to convey possession, equation and attribution. In
the case of possession, there is no dedicated possessive construction. Speakers in-
stead resort to the locative construction, thereby conceptualizing possession as a spa-
tial relation (when using spatial prepositions) or an accompaniment (when using the

38 The alternative possibility would be to analyze these cases as consisting of a non-verbal predicate
(a noun, adjective or quantifier), and a subject that is introduced by a preposition. This is a possible
analysis, too: such a constituent order is attested in both the equative and the attributive construc-
tion; and prepositions introduce subjects in the equative constructions. However, as discussed in the
text, I consider the overall evidence to be in favor of the locative analysis. This decision has the addi-
tional advantage that the morphosyntax provides unambiguous criteria for identifying the constitu-
ents – whereas the alternative possibility introduces the danger of relying on subjective assessments
as to whether a specific case is locative or equative/attributive in meaning.
",50.16288757324219,1,0.8837328366210931," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

",45.8298225402832,0,0.9159801294683336,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",47.030181884765625,0,0.8768731253439173," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap
 dap.. [ama=qaqera-ki ama=vu-ki]NP,
 but ART=person-SG.F ART=bad-SG.F
 de=ta=tis-ki ma=sinap

b. de saqika iaqamqaqraqa
 desaqi-ka [ia-ka=ama=qaqera-ka]NP
 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

" It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",1,0.8924756294427137," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?

‘sit down, and.. and.. and.. and.. and the.. uh and Bridget, she will be
looking at you’ (C12VARPLAY-437)
The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.
",54.51620864868164,0,0.8008227992910011,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",57.35208511352539,0,0.8099130663497293," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in

some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",51.86876678466797,0,0.8695879130427864,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

Transitivity | 235
Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.

(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",35.09347915649414,1,0.8190830049240653," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",40.49331665039063,4,0.901493720294875," The above discussion has shown that, despite their diachronic relationship, there
are considerable synchronic differences between relational nouns and possessed
nouns: relational nouns have to occur within prepositional phrases, the form and dis-
tribution of their possessor indexes show differences, they cannot be marked for noun
class and they do not function as heads of possessive noun phrases. Given these dif-
ferences, I consider them a separate word class. There would be some justification in
analyzing them synchronically as postpositions. I have nevertheless opted for an
analysis in terms of relational nouns in order to emphasize their diachronic origins as
possessed nouns and their continued morphosyntactic similarity to possessive struc-
tures.
6.2 Adverbs
All attested adverbs are listed in Table 69. They are defined as a word class on the
basis of their syntactic behavior, although some adverbs (in particular, spatial ad-
verbs) exhibit additional syntactic properties and are considered distinct formal sub-
classes. Morphologically, all adverbs are unmarked, and there is no productive
means for deriving adverbs from other word classes (even though some adverbs prob-
ably have a multimorphemic origin). Semantically, most adverbs convey information
on space, time, and quantity (including frequency and collectivity). Interestingly,
there are hardly any manner adverbs.
",46.07506561279297,0,0.9094986978817244," The noun classes surface in a large number of grammatical environments. The
free pronouns distinguish noun class, and they gave rise to object suffixes on verbs
and prepositions. The classes are also overtly marked by suffixes on the noun (except-
ing the special case of masculine and feminine plurals) and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun: adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives, in-
definite pronouns, and some interrogative pronouns. The genders surface in the form
of possessor indexes on possessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associ-
ative pronouns. Chapters 3 and 5 give more information on these word classes and
their characteristic membership and properties.
",55.094181060791016,0,0.8965278503088664," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",50.06573867797852,1,0.8902046698455259,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",33.46152114868164,0,0.9351917477406464," NM=how.much/manyfrom/with=ART=minute
 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

 ‘we shine into the water (to catch fish)’ (N11AAGBROTHERS-0019)
Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",43.42879867553711,0,0.890410735262098,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",44.88459014892578,0,0.9159801294683336," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-

demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",47.02180480957031,4,0.9027604582416486," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",52.62533950805664,0,0.9178275818499164," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",53.64641571044922,0,0.9120412224087648,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",57.46119689941406,1,0.908071501805075," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",60.46821975708008,1,0.9234533580933986," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-

",1,0.8988965860788974," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.

of different vowels.

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.

(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)

perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)

",49.5097885131836,0,0.8902046698455259," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",43.39910888671875,1,0.8968316918982817,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",57.15296173095703,1,0.9144924584412588," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

 ‘we shine into the water (to catch fish)’ (N11AAGBROTHERS-0019)
Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",64.61614990234375,0,0.8809920807129815," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

"The distribution of nouns (as heads of noun phrases) and adjectives (as modifiers
within noun phrases) is fairly straightforward. They share morphological similarities
in that both nouns and adjectives are marked for noun class and are preceded by ar-
ticles. And they differ in that only nouns can have an inherent noun class, while ad-
jectives always agree with the class of their head noun; there are also slight differ-
ences in the noun class paradigms of nouns and adjectives. And although the article
 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases | 67
ama, which introduces modifiers, is segmentally identical (and presumably dia-
chronically related) to one of the articles introducing head nouns, it synchronically
belongs to a different paradigm.

 ‘and he sees [a.. a big vine]NP’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0013)
This seemingly clear picture is complicated by two observations. First, adjectives
freely convert to nouns, in which case they occur as heads of noun phrases. For ex-
ample, the head noun in (2a) is gil-ki ‘small-SG.F’ (converted from the adjective gil
‘small’), co-occurring with a pre-head demonstrative. Such converted nouns do not
have an inherent noun class, but reflect the class of their referent (i.e., a girl in (2a),
thus triggering the use of the feminine noun class). Second, modification within the
noun phrase is not restricted to adjectives. For example, the noun gam-ki ‘seed-SG.F’
occurs in the modifier slot in (2b), restricting the reference of iling ‘pumpkin’ (which
denotes various edible parts of the pumpkin, e.g., pumpkin leaves, but also pumpkin
fruits). There are subtle formal differences between adjectival and nominal modifiers
(see section 3.4.2), but both can be used to modify a head noun.

Finally, both nouns and adjectives occur as non-verbal predicates: nouns as equative
predicates (as in 3a), and adjectives, as attributive predicates (as in 3b). The two con-
structions share formal similarities: both have the same constituent order, and both
mark their predicate by an article (which, in the case of nominal predicates, can be
replaced by another pre-head determiner). But, again, there are morphosyntactic dif-
ferences (e.g., the subject is introduced by a preposition in the equative construction,
but not in the attributive construction), which show that these are two separate con-
structions (discussed in chapter 8.2 in more detail).

by far the most frequent prefixes, and they can occur with any of the directionals. The

ter.
",34.625919342041016,0,0.8647474108973244,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",54.21083450317383,4,0.8327326983683276," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the

occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

 ‘normally no-one.. walks differently (i.e., wrongly), but maybe..’
 (I12ABLAJLATASOCIO3-040)
3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",53.43424606323242,4,0.872154767755639," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following
Determination | 109
noun (as in 49b). Although, again, it is more common for the preposition to form a
clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

(N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-0020)
In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

136FF)
3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?
 are-ia-ki nema-ki?

 ama=vilanngi
 ART=NAME:SG.F
 ‘in an abandoned garden, and then, there was a.. a Vilan (spirit)’
 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

Finally, the conjunction ip is used to introduce ordinal numbers (see chapter 3.2.2).
8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

",49.443504333496094,0,0.8902046698455259," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",43.26014709472656,0,0.8968316918982817," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",44.70285034179688,0,0.9159801294683336," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap
 dap.. [ama=qaqera-ki ama=vu-ki]NP,
 but ART=person-SG.F ART=bad-SG.F
 de=ta=tis-ki ma=sinap
 CONJ=3PL.SBJ=call.CONT-3SG.F ART.ID=NAME
 ‘and.. there is a bad person, they call her Sinap’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-031FF)
b. de saqika iaqamqaqraqa
 desaqi-ka [ia-ka=ama=qaqera-ka]NP
 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",46.49859619140625,0,0.9027604582416486,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",57.15281295776367,0,0.9144924584412588," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).
",60.311317443847656,4,0.9489423005345414," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

Although examples like (25a) above are very rare, they do exist. This variation could
suggest that the pronominal objects are clitics, rather than suffixes. Despite the exist-
ence of such examples, I tentatively analyze them as suffixes because they trigger a
phonological change that is otherwise only attested in the case of suffixes.23
There is evidence that many Qaqet roots diachronically contain a final vowel a,
which is synchronically only preserved in those environments where the root is fol-
lowed by a suffix (but not by an enclitic). The clearest evidence comes from nouns
and adjectives (see chapter 4.1.1), but a similar alternation between the presence and
the absence of a final vowel a is also observed in prepositions (see section 5.3.1) and
verbs. In most contexts, a verb such as mat ~ rat ~ tat ~ tmat ‘take’ (and its lenited
form mar ~ rar ~ tar ~ tmar) would appear without a final vowel: in the final position
of an intonation unit (as in 26a), when preceding another phonological word (as in
26b), or when preceding an enclitic (as in 26c). But when it precedes a pronominal
object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).
",0,0.9052688216891832," The transitivity of a verb has to be distinguished from its semantic valency. Very
frequently, transitivity and valency do not match, because Qaqet makes widespread
use of prepositions to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics. There is
an on-going lexicalization process whereby prepositions that originally introduced
adjuncts become integrated into the verb: they start to interact with the argument
structure of individual verbs, and end up as unanalyzable verb particles or suffixes.
In the intermediate stages of this development, this lexicalization process has conse-
quences for the analysis of transitivity and grammatical relations: the question arises
as to whether arguments marked by prepositions should or should not be considered
(direct) objects of transitive verbs. This question cannot be easily decided. To my
knowledge, there are no behavioral or coding properties that would distinguish an
object from an adjunct: they both appear in post-verbal position, neither one is in-
dexed on the verb, and there are no morphosyntactic operations such as passivization
or relativization that would target only the object. The only formal difference seems
to be the presence or absence of a preposition. For this reason, I take this formal dif-
ference as the determining factor: object (and subject) are defined as unmarked argu-
ments, and the transitivity of a verb is defined in terms of the number of unmarked
arguments it can co-occur with. As a result of this definition, the transitivity of a verb
does not necessarily correspond to its valency.

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-

arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

",53.79344940185547,0,0.8327326983683276,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

object, a final vowel a is invariably present (as in 26d): if it were not present, we would
expect the form to be *matki (instead of the actually attested form meraqi ~ mraqi). In
nouns and adjectives, this vowel is only attested in the case of suffixes, and I therefore
also analyze the pronominal objects as suffixes.

23 The object suffix thus shows a closer phonological integration (as an affix) than the subject index
(as a clitic). Mali Baining exhibits a comparable asymmetry (although person-marking overall is pho-
nologically more independent than in Qaqet): Mali object pronouns can be encliticized, while subject
indexes are phonologically independent words (Stebbins 2011: 42–44).

speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the

Transitivity | 233
(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155

comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-

",39.618446350097656,4,0.9267957955705308,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

 ‘but [that water]NP, they cannot cross it’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0004)
Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",54.11080551147461,1,0.9285371956725156," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",38.28947448730469,0,0.9571423014033796," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",51.66936492919922,0,0.9178275818499164," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

",54.29891204833984,1,0.9197685974956352," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

",60.27182388305664,1,0.9552678193534554,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.

(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?
 are-ia-ki nema-ki?
",55.30800247192383,0,0.816285301960015,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",50.741695404052734,0,0.8887553451340681," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",51.66829681396485,4,0.8972774455553464," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",29.76751708984375,0,0.8471561158183842," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",33.182315826416016,0,0.8445719473652081," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

",45.17863464355469,0,0.922340611154092," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).
",53.97966003417969,0,0.9285371956725156," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).
",48.88459396362305,4,0.9216528664641472," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",32.7077751159668,0,0.947889502169846," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",38.18139266967773,0,0.9571423014033796," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

",54.10832214355469,0,0.9197685974956352,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

",44.6639518737793,4,0.8797004129606788," This section presents the consonant phonemes in the following order: (i) voice-
less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:
(1)kʰəpɲip̚
 kə=pɲip

 ‘he is dying’ (AJL-15/06/2011)
22 | Phonology
Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives
Phonemes, allophones and the orthography | 23
often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).
",52.41423797607422,0,0.8327326983683276," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.
",55.03757095336914,0,0.816285301960015," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

",51.380558013916016,2,0.909752572484804,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",56.76239776611328,0,0.9208411698863632," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

(ii) Object argument
The object argument always follows the verb, either as a noun phrase (as in 22a) or as
a pronominal suffix (as in 22b). These two are mutually exclusive, i.e., different from
the subject argument, the object argument does not receive a separate index. The ob-
ject suffixes originated in free pronouns, and thus distinguish all noun classes. The
subject indexes, by contrast, have collapsed some of the noun class distinctions (see
chapter 3.2.3). This mismatch is illustrated in example (22c): it contains two referents
from the same shape-based noun class (ini ‘SG.DIM’), once as a free pronoun in subject
function and once as an object suffix. The subject index, by contrast, collapses all
shape-based noun classes into a single neuter gender (nga ‘3N.SBJ’).

The object noun phrase can form a clitic group with the preceding verb. This is espe-
cially common in the case of vowel-final verbs preceding vowel-initial noun phrases.
Example (23a) illustrates a typical context: the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’ preceding the article
ama ‘ART’. In other environments, no such cliticization is observed. The difference
between the two environments is illustrated with the two adjacent utterances in (23b):
the first object noun phrase is consonant-initial and does not cliticize to tlu ‘see’, but
the second is vowel-initial and does cliticize.

In the case of the verb lu ~ tlu ‘see’, further phonological reduction can occur if it is
followed by a demonstrative (which always starts with the syllable lu). This demon-
strative can either occur as a separate word (as in 23b above), or it can cliticize to the
verb – and in this case, its initial syllable is lost (as in 24 below). A similar loss of
identical syllables was observed in the case of the subject indexes (see point i above).
It is not an automatic rule, though: it is optional, and it is only attested in cases where
there is a diachronic relationship between the syllables (see chapter 3.3.2 for the ori-
gins of the demonstratives).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",37.68083190917969,1,0.8337688339335686," The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.
",28.82397079467773,0,0.8471561158183842," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)

",32.34033966064453,1,0.9541270656345748," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",38.12744140625,1,0.9633798648681084,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",44.33150100708008,0,0.9159801294683336,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

",51.256717681884766,0,0.9241082512998434,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).
",52.99248504638672,0,0.9120412224087648," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

 ‘we shine into the water (to catch fish)’ (N11AAGBROTHERS-0019)
Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.
",60.00092697143555,0,0.9552678193534554," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

" The morphological complexity of a verb does not determine its transitivity and
argument structure. Both types of verbs can be intransitive (as the simple verb in 8a
and the complex verb in 8b); and both can be transitive (as in 9a and 9b). Both types
of verbs can introduce arguments through prepositions (as in 10a and 10b). And both
can occur in constructions with reduced transitivity, such as the agentless construc-
tion that presents an event as non-controlled (as in 11a and 11b). Issues of transitivity
are discussed in section 5.2.

Finally, verbs show stem alternations that convey aspectual distinctions. Most verbs
distinguish a non-continuous stem (as in 12a and 12b) and a continuous stem (as in
12c), but there are also conjugation classes that have only one (unchangeable) stem
or three different stems (e.g., mes ~ es ~ tes ‘eat’ in the second clause of 12a); plus
possibly additional stems occurring in other contexts. These alternations, and their
relationship to the tense categories coded in the subject indexes, are discussed in sec-
tion 5.4.

The patterns reported above for Qaqet are reminiscent of pervasive lexicalization pat-
terns discussed in the literature on Papuan languages (as summarized, e.g., in Foley
1986: 111–166; see especially Pawley’s 1993 classic article). Complex events are often
broken into more fine-grained components that are then combined in complex ex-
pressions, often in the form of serial verb constructions (where a semantically general
verb combines with a more specific verb), but also in the form of a semantically more
general verb combining with a more specific preposition or nominal. The rules for
forming complex expressions are usually analyzable and productive, but there is a
considerable amount of idiomaticity involved, determining which of the possible
 Transitivity | 227
combinations are well-formed and meaningful. Furthermore, Papuan languages of-
ten have a multiplicity of verb stems distinguishing controlled from uncontrolled
events as well as continuative from completed events. There is only one Papuan pat-
tern that is not attested in Qaqet (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 38–57): stem alter-
nations depending on person and number of arguments.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",33.848140716552734,1,0.8962455742777656," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).
",44.50004577636719,4,0.9044847653798208,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).
",54.897891998291016,0,0.816285301960015," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",50.03789520263672,0,0.9137055989929836," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

",35.72966766357422,2,0.8461610101431396," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).
",28.43889236450196,4,0.8719404682375261," This section introduces the prefixes in the following order: (i) the prefixes a- ‘DIR’

‘HERE’ and miasi- ‘THERE’.

The prefixes a- ‘DIR’ and i- ‘AWAY’ are the most common directional prefixes: they are
by far the most frequent prefixes, and they can occur with any of the directionals. The
prefix a- ‘DIR’ is neutral, while i- ‘AWAY’ entails a direction away from the deictic cen-
ter.
",32.88057327270508,0,0.8445719473652081," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",44.20993423461914,1,0.9285366992588776," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

Finally, the conjunction ip is used to introduce ordinal numbers (see chapter 3.2.2).
8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",32.27666473388672,0,0.9541270656345748," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",38.1210823059082,0,0.9633798648681084," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.
(8) a. dap.. amaqaqraqi amavuqi, deratiski masinap
 dap.. [ama=qaqera-ki ama=vu-ki]NP,

 ‘and.. there is a bad person, they call her Sinap’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-031FF)
b. de saqika iaqamqaqraqa

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",42.52533721923828,0,0.9221337671739376," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following

clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

 ‘but [that water]NP, they cannot cross it’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0004)
Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.

 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).
",52.950416564941406,0,0.9120412224087648," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

",56.83271789550781,2,0.9521867099264856," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.
",59.78667831420898,1,0.9614639074582408," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO
verbs (marking it like an object or prepositional object).
",5,0.9360495247189736," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

",54.63331985473633,0,0.816285301960015,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",49.91923904418945,0,0.9137055989929836," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",51.2867317199707,1,0.940693065509904," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

",25.44093132019043,0,0.8543804503310536," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

",28.23416328430176,0,0.8719404682375261," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

",32.06390380859375,4,0.8691965097890405," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

",48.10541534423828,0,0.9278904299288762," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in

some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",43.92997741699219,0,0.9407644818874756," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

",53.48511505126953,0,0.9197685974956352," Qaqet has an elaborate system of noun classification: noun classes are overtly
marked on nouns and pronouns, on agreeing elements within the noun phrase and
on a number of argument indexes. This chapter frequently makes reference to this
noun class system, but a more detailed discussion of its forms, meanings and distri-
butions is postponed until chapter 4. Note that this grammar distinguishes termino-
logically between “noun class” (used in reference to the full system of classification)
and “gender” (used in reference to a reduced form of the system) (see chapter 4 for
details).
3.1 Introductory remarks on word classes and phrases
This section introduces the word class of nouns (section 3.1.1) and the structure of the
noun phrase (section 3.1.2). Both sections also include a more general discussion on
the issue of word classes and phrasehood in Qaqet. Overall, there is considerable mor-
phosyntactic evidence for the existence of word classes and phrase structure, but
there are two qualifications to be added. First, many Qaqet roots occur underived in
different morphosyntactic environments. As discussed below, I do not consider such
roots to be acategorial, but analyze them as cases of conversion. Second, although
the constituent order within phrases tends to be rigid and contiguous, there are ex-
amples whose constituents appear in different orders, including some non-contigu-
ous orders. It is likely that information structural considerations and/or subtle func-
tional differences will eventually be able to account for the attested variation. For
now, the number of counter-examples is too small to allow for any generalizations.
Mali Baining shares the phenomenon of conversion (Stebbins 2011: 58–59, 95–97),
but there is no information available on variable orders within phrases.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to

refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?
 are-ia-ki nema-ki?
",61.38822555541992,0,0.9312653755732662," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

 ‘how many minutes (lit. the minutes are how many)?’
 (LONGYDS20150516_1-338)
Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

 ‘and they are actually the troops (lit. line-up)’ (N11AAGSIRINILOBSTER2-
 0051)
Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise
Modification | 155
there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).
",33.588497161865234,4,0.9207160826272286," Qaqet thus seems to have inherited many semantic patterns, but the formal
means of expressing them differ somewhat. Qaqet mainly uses prepositions to con-
strain the general meaning of verbs – not serial verb constructions (but see the dis-
cussion in section 5.5). And it uses syntactic means to distinguish between controlled
and non-controlled events (in particular, the agentless construction for presenting
events as non-controlled) – not verb stem alternations or inflectional morphology. It
does show formal similarities to other Papuan languages, in that it employs stem al-
ternation to convey aspectual distinctions.
5.2 Transitivity
This section discusses the issue of transitivity in Qaqet. Verbs in Qaqet can be either
intransitive (allowing for at most one unmarked argument, occurring in subject func-
tion) or transitive (allowing for at most two unmarked arguments, occurring in sub-
ject and object function); there are no ditransitive verbs. All arguments can be omit-
ted if they are recoverable from the context.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",54.56258773803711,1,0.8224029290473808," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

",57.66828536987305,0,0.9163353890120102," Clauses can be juxtaposed without any conjunctions, but such cases are uncom-
mon and are usually accompanied by some other indication of their relationship. Ex-
ample (41a) illustrates a typical case: the two clauses (one containing a verb of think-
ing, and the other, the content of the thought) are juxtaposed, and the intervening
demonstrative adverb taquarl ‘thus’ signals the relationship between the two. An-
other demonstrative adverb, ma ‘thus’, is especially common in this context, often
following verbs of speaking, perception or cognition (as in 41b). It belongs formally
to the class of adverbs (see chapter 6.2), but it is arguably developing into a conjunc-
tion that introduces speech and thought. It is marked through a unique prosody: a
level tone plus glottalization (see chapter 2.3.2 for details).

The overall patterns of clause linking are similar to those found in Mali Baining
(Stebbins 2011: 15–16, 91–93, 248–280), but they are unusual from a Papuan perspec-
tive. Many Papuan languages are known to employ multi-verb constructions, clause-
chaining, switch reference, and/or subordination (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002:
36; Foley 1986: 167–205). As for (mono- or biclausal) multi-verb constructions, it is
possible that Qaqet had such constructions in the past, but they have given rise to
synchronic modifiers (see chapter 5.5) and particles (see chapter 7.1). And there is no
evidence for the existence of either clause-chaining or switch reference. Since both
436 | Clauses
are usually associated with an AOV constituent order, it is probably not surprising
that they are absent in Qaqet. More surprising is the absence of any clear cases of
subordination. Qaqet does have tail-head linkage, which is common in Papuan and
neighboring languages (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 36–37), but again, tail-head
linkage is achieved through the linking of two main clauses (see chapters 3.3.2 and
7.5).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

",31.81065559387207,0,0.9541270656345748," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in

some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

",37.88146209716797,0,0.9633798648681084,"236 | Verbs and the structure of the predicate
There is a small group of verbs that mark nominal and pronominal objects differently.
If the object is a lexical noun phrase, it remains unmarked (as in 27a). But if it is a
pronoun, it is introduced by the form ma (as in 27b). It is not entirely clear how to
analyze this form. On the one hand, its behavior is similar to that of a preposition (see
section 5.3). On the other hand, Qaqet does not have a preposition ma. On the basis
of comparative evidence, it might be possible to relate it to one of the existing prepo-
sitions, either to met ‘in’ or to ne ‘from/with’. In Mali, the preposition mēt ‘inside’
(cognate to Qaqet met ‘in’) has an allomorph ma (Stebbins 2011: 125), and the prepo-
sition na ‘from’ (cognate to Qaqet ne ‘from/with’) has an allomorph mo preceding
some of the directionals (Stebbins 2011: 196–197). That is, it is possible that ma in
(27b) has its origin in one of these prepositions. But regardless of its origin, the syn-
chronic alternation is between an unmarked lexical noun phrase and a marked pro-
noun. It is true that some prepositions have different forms when preceding a noun
or a pronoun, but there are no prepositions that alternate with zero. I therefore tenta-
tively analyze ma as an overt object marker: it probably developed diachronically
from a preposition, but it introduces synchronically the pronominal direct object of
some verbs.

The object argument is not necessarily overtly realized. For example, the transitive
verb tes ‘eat’ appears with a direct object in (28a), but without one in (28b). The omis-
sion of a direct object is partly conditioned by discourse structure: an object can only
be omitted if it is recoverable from the context, e.g., because it is mentioned previ-
ously (as the malay apples in 28b). And it is partly conditioned by animacy: a known
animate participant is not omitted, but realized as a pronoun (as in 28c). These are
the most common patterns emerging from the data, but it is likely that a future in-
depth study will reveal further conditioning factors.

5.2.2 Agentless construction
It is possible to suppress the agent argument of a transitive verb (including all its ex-
ponents, i.e. both the subject noun phrase and the subject index), leaving only the
patient argument. The same pattern is available for intransitive bivalent verbs (i.e.,
verbs that introduce their patient argument through a preposition), but not for intran-
sitive monovalent verbs (a few exceptions are discussed below).

",45.45846176147461,0,0.9398617782201932," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found

",56.57186508178711,0,0.9583428505324436," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",59.36708450317383,0,0.9614639074582408,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

" Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-

",56.22335815429688,0,0.9208411698863632," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).
",57.63679885864258,4,0.9406572353619196,"In all cases, the patient is marked in exactly the same way as in the corresponding
agentive utterance. For example, the verb bup ‘fill’ can occur transitively, with the
patient being linked to direct object function, i.e., it is unmarked and it follows the
verb (as in 29a). This verb can also appear in the agentless construction. In this case,
the agent is omitted, and the patient continues to be expressed in the same way as
before: either as an unmarked noun phrase following the verb (as in 29b), or as a pro-
nominal suffix (as in 29c). A corresponding pattern is observed in the case of verbs
that introduce their patient arguments by means of prepositions. For example, sirlek
‘throw’ introduces its patient argument by means of the preposition ne ‘from/with’,
both when an agent is present (as in 30a) and when it is absent (as in 30b).

Qaqet verbs thus mark their only argument in two different ways. As discussed in sec-
tion 5.2.1, some verbs mark it like the subject of a transitive verb (i.e., in preverbal
position and with a subject index on the verb). And as discussed above, other verbs
appear in the agentless construction and mark it like the object of a transitive verb or
like the prepositional object of an intransitive verb (i.e., in postverbal position, and
without an index on the verb). This distribution is lexically determined, and it is pos-
sible to analyze Qaqet as having a split-intransitive system that distinguishes be-
tween a class of SA verbs (marking their argument like a subject) and a class of SO

",30.77577018737793,5,0.8995988177264275,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",38.0778923034668,0,0.9453901802126088," It is possible that the different orders allow speakers to adopt different perspec-
tives on a situation. This point is illustrated below with the help of property concepts.
Qaqet lexicalizes such concepts in both adjectives and nouns (see also section 3.4.1):
different properties allow for one or the other or both. In (103a) and (103b), the prop-
erties are expressed in the post-head adjective sesek ‘light’ (in the modifier construc-
tion) and in the post-head noun qesep-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’ (in the nominal modifier
construction). In (103c), by contrast, the property is expressed in the abstract head
noun merlen-ka ‘heaviness-SG.M’, which precedes a prepositional phrase (expressing
the location of this concept). Discussions with speakers suggest that example (103c)
focuses on the property, i.e., on the heaviness. In the other two examples, by contrast,
the focus is on the referent (with the property characterizing this referent). It is possi-
ble that pre-head modifiers (as in the examples above) allow for a similar shift in per-
spective, i.e., an emphasis on the property, not on the referent. But this hypothesis
would need further investigation.

3.4.1 Adjectives and the modifier construction
Adjectives constitute a distinct word class in Qaqet: although they share morphosyn-
tactic similarities with nouns and they can freely convert to nouns, there are formal
differences that justify setting up a distinct class (see section 3.1.1 for a discussion of
similarities and differences).
",43.85125732421875,1,0.9346171608463548," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

3.4.3 Prepositional phrases and directionals
Prepositional phrases (as in 119a) and directionals (as in 119b) can function as modi-
fiers to a head noun. Like the other modifiers, they almost always occur post-head.
Different from the others, they are not introduced by the article ama; and different
from the modifier construction, there is no agreement. Instead, they retain the inter-
nal structure of prepositional phrases or directionals (see chapter 5.3 on prepositional
phrases and chapter 6.3 on directionals), often resulting in syntactically ambiguous
structures. In (119a), the context suggests that the prepositional phrase forms part of
the noun phrase. Out of context, however, this example could alternatively instanti-
ate either the locative construction (with the interpretation of ‘canoes are (made) from
taro’) or the equative construction (with the interpretation of ‘the taro is a canoe’). In
(119b), the morphosyntax only allows for the noun phrase interpretation – otherwise

there would have to be an overt conjunction i (for the interpretation of ‘the child
comes back from down there and says’).

Despite their formal differences to other types of modifiers, there is overlap with the
nominal modifier construction. This overlap is restricted to abstract nouns that can
function both as head nouns and as nominal modifiers. Example (120a) illustrates a
noun phrase containing a prepositional phrase: the head noun is nauisaqa ‘blue-
ness:SG.M’, and the prepositional phrase specifies the location of this color. And ex-
ample (120b) illustrates the nominal modifier construction: here, the head noun is
daqa ‘taro:SG.M’, and the modifier consists of the noun grlan ‘yellowness’ and a prep-
ositional phrase (with the pronominal prepositional object being co-referential to the
head noun daqa ‘taro:SG.M’). The two structures are similar in that both contain a
nominal property concept and a prepositional phrase (specifying the location of the
property), but they differ in the syntactic status of the property noun (as head noun
in 120a and as modifier in 120b).

3.5 Possession
In possessive noun phrases, the possessor noun precedes the possessed noun,
and the possessor is indexed in the form of a clitic on the possessed noun.
Qaqet thus shares the typical word order of East Papuan languages – despite
not sharing the concomitant verb-final constituent order and postpositions.
Conversely, Qaqet does not display any of the typical Oceanic features: there
are no possessive classifiers and no suffix-marked possessives, and a distinc-
tion between alienable and inalienable possession is marginal (see the discus-
sion on possession in Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill (2002: 33–34), and the sum-
marizing tables in Dunn et al. (2008: 743)).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function

gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

",52.06078338623047,4,0.9502080709329104,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",56.44113540649414,0,0.9583428505324436,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

 The double-marking structure exemplified in (3d) above is not attested else-
where. It probably results from the diachronic process, with ka ‘3SG.M’ no longer being
interpreted as subject morphemes. Such a re-interpretation is further suggested by
phonetic erosion: it is not uncommon for the proclitic ka ‘3SG.M.SBJ’ to be realized as
a (as in 4a and 4b). A comparable erosion is never found in subject morphemes cliti-
cizing to verbs.

If a particle inflects for subject, this morpheme is always invariable. In most cases,
this morpheme is ka ‘3SG.M’ (as in 5a and 5b), and once, it is ini ‘SG.DIM’ (as in 5c). This
morpheme is always used, even if it does not match the subject of the main verb: e.g.,
the subjects of the main verbs are ure ‘1PL.SBJ.NPST’ and ta ‘3PL.SBJ’ in the two clauses
in (5a), ki ‘3SG.F.SBJ.NPST’ in (5b), and ut ‘1PL.SBJ’ in (5c). Recall that both the 3SG.M cat-
egory and the DIM category are attested as default noun classes, i.e., they are used in
cases where the class of the referent is irrelevant or unknown (see chapters 4.2.1 and
4.2.4). It is very likely that they receive a non-referential subject interpretation here,
with a more literal translation of ‘it is emphasized that’ (in 5a), ‘it is intended that’ (in
5b) and ‘it is assumed that’ (in 5c).

There is considerable variation in the expression of the subject category: some parti-
cles can occur either with or without it; those that can occur with it are all attested
with both full and reduced forms (i.e., ka ~ a ‘3SG.M.SBJ’); and some (like kias ‘actually’
in 3b to 3d) can express the subject either as a proclitic, as a suffix or both. It was not
possible to determine any difference in meaning or use, and the variants are thus ten-
tatively considered to be in free variation. It is likely that this variation is triggered by
the grammaticalization process from full verbs to invariant particles.
",0,0.9360495247189736," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.
",43.91670989990234,1,0.9105293306047662,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",51.47397994995117,0,0.8632106853241953," In possessive noun phrases, Qaqet displays the typical Papuan order of the pos-
sessor preceding the possessed – despite not (or no longer) having the concomitant
Papuan verb-final constituent order. Qaqet also does not have any possessive classi-
fiers, which are typical of Oceanic languages (although they are largely absent in
neighboring Oceanic languages, too). There is evidence for Qaqet having the category
of inalienable possession (which is typical of Oceanic languages), but it only concerns
a handful of items (a few kinship nouns, relational nouns and irregular proforms).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-

",48.4410285949707,0,0.940693065509904," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

",36.85248947143555,0,0.9453901802126088," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.
",43.67168426513672,1,0.9406617260713004," Both pronouns usually occur in non-verbal expressions (as in 40a and 40b above)
or one-word questions (as in 40c above), but they can also occur in the other syntactic
functions available to nouns, e.g., as subjects (in 41a below), objects (in 41b) or prep-
ositional objects (as in 41c).

",51.02580261230469,0,0.9347747591372444," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.
",37.01322555541992,0,0.9633798648681084," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

Given their nominal character, both the predicate and the subject are marked for
noun class. Since the two nouns designate different entities in the world, their noun
classes do not necessarily match, and each noun retains its inherent noun class. For
example, the predicate in (32a) is the feminine noun smeski ‘food:SG.F’, while the sub-
ject is a masculine pronoun (referring back to the singular masculine noun lengiqa
‘word:SG.M’). Or the predicate in (32b) is the singular noun lainnga ‘line:SG.M’ (having
a collective reference to the family line), while the subject is a plural pronoun.

Aside from coincidental matches (where the inherent noun classes of subject and
predicate happen to match), matches are found only in those cases, where the predi-
cate has no inherent noun class, but takes on the noun class of its referent. Mostly
(but not exclusively, see below), these are nouns converted from adjectives. For ex-
ample, the adjective gil ‘small’ converts into the noun gil ‘small one’, which can be
marked for any noun class, e.g., gilka ‘a small (singular masculine) one’ or gilki ‘a
small (singular feminine) one’. When such nouns occur in the equative construction,
the noun class of subject and predicate usually match (as in 33a and 33b). If the sub-
ject is a speech act participant, the predicate noun would still change depending on
the noun class of the referent. For example, the pronoun nyi ‘2SG’ does not distinguish
gender, but this information is coded in the predicate noun (in 33c and 33d).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

",50.272796630859375,0,0.9669384669664546," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).
",51.94681167602539,4,0.9362194833085468,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.
",52.032012939453125,0,0.9502080709329104," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.
",55.59239959716797,0,0.9583428505324436,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced

‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).
(40) a.ariaik nemgi?
 are-ia-ki nema-ki?
",61.43799591064453,0,0.9514524921527658
"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

",33.125999450683594,0,0.926760647852174," The particles share formal and semantic similarities with the class of adverbs (see
chapter 6.2 for a comparison). Formally, the members of both classes are synchroni-
cally non-inflecting and morphologically simple, although a diachronic origin of par-
ticles in verbs is visible in some optional and rudimentary inflectional possibilities.
And semantically, both classes convey (amongst others) temporal and aspectual in-
formation. They differ in their syntactic distribution, though: adverbs occur in the
right periphery of the clause, unless they are formally marked; while particles always
occur in the left periphery, co-occurring in a fixed order.

meaning is that of ‘my friend(s)’ (as in 128a). The plural form is also used as an inter-
jection to convey empathy (as in 128b). It is not possible to replace gua ‘1SG.POSS’ with
any of the other possessor indexes to convey a different possessive relation (e.g., one
could not use gia ‘2SG.POSS’ in order to convey the meaning of ‘your friend(s)’).

Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

In the case of trivalent verbs, at most one argument is linked to direct object function
(and the other, or sometimes both, are expressed via prepositions). The relevant ar-
gument is usually the recipient (as in 49a and 49b), although a few verbs select a
theme (as in 49c).

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Finally, ambitransitive verbs alternating between inchoative and causative uses are
almost absent. All attested cases involve lexicalizations (as in example 32 above); oth-
erwise, speakers resort to the agentless construction (see section 5.2.2).
5.3 Prepositions: Introducing participants
Qaqet makes extensive use of prepositions to introduce participants in different se-
mantic roles to an event (summarized in Table 61).

 Prepositions: Introducing participants | 253
Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as
adjunct, as argument introduced by a preposition, or as unmarked argument. This
variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

",36.81260299682617,0,0.9453901802126088," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

Left-dislocation is not restricted to participants in an event, but is also found for all
other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to

refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only

hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

Left-dislocation is not restricted to participants in an event, but is also found for all
other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",0,0.9360495247189736," In the nominal domain, Qaqet exhibits a number of characteristic East Papuan
features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins
2009a; Terrill 2002). Most notably, nouns are marked for noun class (distinguishing
two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,
dual and plural), and the classes overtly appear in a large number of grammatical
environments: as free pronouns and as arguments that developed from the free pro-
nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

ter.
",43.60269165039063,0,0.9165391960703252," The forms and patterns discussed in this chapter are very similar to those of Mali
Baining (as described in Stebbins 2011). But despite an overall similarity, there are
considerable differences in detail, with evidence pointing both to innovations and to
the re-organization of shared forms and inherited structures. Similarities and differ-
ences were noted throughout this chapter. From an East Papuan perspective, the
structure of possession is of main interest: Qaqet shares the typical Papuan word or-
der of the possessor noun preceding the possessed noun (without having retained a
verb-final constituent order or postpositions), and does not exhibit any typical Oce-
anic features (i.e., it has no possessive classifiers, no suffix-marked possessives, and
the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is at best marginal)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–34; Dunn et al. 2008: 743). Finally, from an areal
perspective, the existence of articles is noteworthy, as they are most likely borrowings
from Oceanic (Stebbins 2009a; see also Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 34–36; Dunn
et al. 2008: 743).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-

Ambitransitive verbs are infrequent. In most cases, such verbs have distinct (albeit
related) senses, and I therefore analyze them as distinct lexemes – even though their
formal properties suggest that they are diachronically related. For example, quarl ~
kuarl has a meaning of ‘present (give, show)’ when occurring transitively (as in 50a),
but ‘shine a light (in order to catch fish)’ when occurring intransitively (as in 50b).

Transitive verbs often omit their direct object, and thus look indistinguishable from
intransitive verbs. Whenever the object is recoverable from the context, I consider
such verbs to be transitive (see section 5.2.1). This analysis holds for the majority of
cases, but there remains a small number of unclear cases. Some emotion verbs such
as ning ~ ngning ‘fear’ are possibly ambitransitive, occurring either with a stimulus
object (as in 51a) or without (as in 51b). An animate object (as in 51b) would normally
not be omitted, but be expressed pronominally: its absence in (51b) could point to the
verb being used intransitively. In addition, there are a few verbs such as rerles ~ terles
‘hide’ that receive a reflexive interpretation when used intransitively (see example 31
above). Mostly, though, reflexivity is overtly expressed through nas ‘self’.

Depending on the verb semantics, the syntactic status of the participant varies: as

variation is the result of a lexicalization process, whereby prepositions are first re-
cruited to introduce arguments entailed by the verb semantics and eventually become
lexicalized as verb particles and suffixes.

",28.21632957458496,0,0.8995988177264275," Most nouns are conventionally assigned to a single noun class only (although
speakers can shift to other classes in order to highlight specific properties of a refer-
ent). The main exception are nouns with human reference, which do not belong to a
conventionalized class, but are assigned to a class depending on the sex of their real-
world referent. For example, the noun qaqera ‘person’ appears with feminine singu-
lar marking in (8a), but masculine singular marking in (8b), referring to a woman and
a man respectively. It would even be possible to shift to other classes to highlight non-
sex-based properties of a human referent, e.g., to the diminutive class in example (9)
below.

 CONJagain-3SG.M other-SG.M=ART=person-SG.M
 ‘and he is also a (kind of) person’ (D12ADKSPIRITS-053)
In all cases, the class of the noun determines the form of the pronominal reference,
the person indexes and the agreement. For example, the adjective vu ‘bad’ in (8a) and
the indefinite determiner ia ‘other’ in (8b) agree with their head; and the object pro-
noun in (8a) is co-referential with the feminine singular noun. In (8a) and (8b), the
noun class and the sex of the referent happen to coincide. But in (9) below, they hap-
pen to differ: a diminutive noun class, with presumably a male or female real-world
referent – and it is the diminutive class that triggers the use of the neuter subject in-
dex; the masculine or feminine indexes could not be used. This is only possible in
 Heads of noun phrases | 75
some restricted environments, where the sex of a real-world referent can override the
grammatical class: this phenomenon is observed for some possessor indexes (see
chapter 4.3) and for some nominal modifiers originating in the non-verbal equative
construction (see chapter 8.2.3).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same

form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-

arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to

refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced

‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

",44.48970031738281,0,0.9518815091513116,"Speakers can choose to assign a noun to the opposite class, in which case they
highlight an unusual or untypical referent. For example, surl-ka ‘fence-SG.M’ can ap-
pear as feminine surl-ki ‘fence-SG.F’ in order to highlight an incomplete fence that has
just been started around a new garden. Or dul-ka ‘stone-SG.M’ can appear as feminine
dul-ki ‘stone-SG.F’ to express frustration with a particular stone. In everyday speech,
such shifts are not very common, and they do not straightforwardly shed light on the
semantic organization of the system. Instead, what seems to be of pragmatic im-
portance is the fact of the shift itself. Interestingly, Dickhardt (2009: 156) observes
that such shifts are a characteristic property of verbal exchanges that take place dur-
ing public meetings aimed at conflict resolution. Unfortunately, our corpus does not
contain recordings of such events, and it is thus not possible to investigate the pat-
terns of shift further.

(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

The determiners are considered clitics, not affixes, because they can occur as free
morphemes. With the exception of the demonstratives (as in 48c above), this is rare,
but possible (e.g., in 49a below). In careful speech, it is also not uncommon for a de-
terminer to form a clitic group with a preceding preposition, and not with a following
Determination | 109
noun (as in 49b). Although, again, it is more common for the preposition to form a
clitic group together with the entire noun phrase (see also chapter 5.3.1).

3.3.2 Demonstratives
The Qaqet demonstratives are morphologically complex, consisting of a demonstra-
tive base lu, a noun class suffix, and a deictic root. The deictic roots are -iara ‘PROX’, -a
‘DIST’, and mara ‘here’ (usually realized as an enclitic). Chapter 4.1.2 discusses the
resulting forms in more detail, including the evidence for the status of the deictic
roots as suffixes or clitics. The present chapter, by contrast, focuses on the distribu-
tion of (i) the demonstrative words (occurring pronominally and adnominally), (ii)
the deictic roots (occurring adverbially), and (iii) the demonstrative base lu (occurring
adverbially).
(i) Demonstrative word
The demonstrative word occurs both pronominally and adnominally. As a pronoun,
it occurs in almost all syntactic functions available to common nouns, e.g., as left-
dislocated constituent (in 50a), subject (in 50b), direct object (in 50c) or prepositional
object (in 50d). It can also function as the possessor within a possessive noun phrase,
but not as the possessed entity (see section 3.5.2). Furthermore, the demonstrative
pronoun cannot co-occur with other noun phrase elements.

As an adnominal demonstrative, it agrees in noun class and number with its head
noun. Its position relative to the head noun is not fixed, as shown by the two contras-
tive examples below: it most frequently occurs at the left edge of the noun phrase (as
in 51a), but there are a good number of examples where it immediately follows its
head (as in 51b). In possessive structures, it obligatorily occurs in post-head position.
But other than that, the factors that determine its position are not clear: the two ex-
amples below are parallel, they occur in comparable contexts, and they were uttered
by the same speaker – and yet they differ in the position of the demonstrative.

Regardless of the position of the demonstrative, the head noun is always marked by
either the article ama or the article ma. Examples (52a) below and (51a) above illus-
trate this kind of marking for pre-head demonstratives, and (52b) below and (51b)
above, for post-head demonstratives.
",1,0.941993318297229,"4 Nominal classification
Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).
",32.66572189331055,0,0.926760647852174," Similarly, the pronominal categories are characteristic of East Papuan (Dunn,
Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 40–41, 45–48; Stebbins 2009a): Qaqet has dedicated dual
pronouns, and it shows no evidence for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive
first person. Like in many other East Papuan languages, participants are indexed on
the verb, but they are indexed by means of subject proclitics and object suffixes (and
not by means of subject suffixes, as is otherwise the preference in East Papuan)
(Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 52–57; Dunn et al. 2008: 743).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

Qaqet has an elaborate system of nominal classification that surfaces on nouns and
pronouns, in agreement morphology and as argument indexes. The classes are thus
identified through their agreement patterns, i.e., they constitute a gender system (fol-
lowing Corbett 1991). Qaqet has two distinct (albeit related) gender systems, and this
grammar adopts the terminological distinction established by Stebbins (2011) for the
Baining languages: it uses “noun class” in reference to the full system (which sur-
faces on nouns and independent pronouns, as object suffixes on verbs and preposi-
tions, and on elements within the noun phrase) and “gender” in reference to a re-
duced system (which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on possessed nouns,
of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns).

intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

 ART=NAME:SG.F
 ‘in an abandoned garden, and then, there was a.. a Vilan (spirit)’
 (I12AANACLADNSOCIO3-476)
The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

",49.16674041748047,0,0.9502080709329104," This section presents the consonant phonemes in the following order: (i) voice-
less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

features (Dunn, Reesink, and Terrill 2002: 33–36; Dunn et al. 2008: 743; Stebbins

two sex-based and six shape-based classes) and number (distinguishing singular,

nouns (object suffixes on verbs and prepositions); and on noun phrase elements
agreeing with the noun (adjectives, the numerals ‘one’ and ‘two’, demonstratives,
some indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘who’). Fur-
thermore, the noun classes are mapped onto a smaller system (labeled ‘gender’
throughout this grammar), which surfaces in the form of possessor indexes on pos-
sessed nouns, of subject indexes on verbs, and as associative pronouns. Both nominal
classification and the dual/plural distinction are widespread among the East Papuan
languages, and are largely absent from Oceanic. But although East Papuan languages
tend to have some form of nominal classification, the formal and semantic properties
of these systems are very different. The Qaqet system shares similarities with those of
other Baining languages, but it remains to be seen whether similarities are also found
with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

with the other East Papuan languages of the Bismarcks.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only

hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

In fact, it is not uncommon for long stretches of discourse to rely on pronouns only
for referent identification (as in (39), where the pronoun ap ‘PL.RCD’ tracks the referent
hlangap ‘bee:PL.RCD’).

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In
Heads of noun phrases | 101
addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

Given that particles can form a proposition, they can be questioned or negated. For
example, in the elicited dialogue in (2), the particle arik ‘supposing’ is questioned by
speaker B and replaced by the particle nani ‘can’, indicating his greater certainty that
the event will, indeed, happen.

Particles frequently combine with each other, always in a fixed order and sometimes
forming formulaic sequences. Table 74 gives an overview of these orders, based on
the attested co-occurrences in the corpus of natural and elicited data. Altogether 13
particle slots have to be posited. The particles within each slot do not co-occur. Note
that this does not necessarily mean that these particles cannot co-occur: some com-
binations are likely to be impossible on semantic grounds, but other combinations
could be possible and just happen to not occur in the available data. It is likely that
additional data will lead to modifications of Table 74. Particles across the two groups
can combine freely in the given order, unless there are semantic restrictions.

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
7.2 Modality
Many of the particles express epistemic, evidential and deontic meanings: (i) ani
‘maybe’, (ii) arik ‘supposing’, (iii) kias ‘actually’, (iv) kui ‘quoting’, (v) kut ‘inferring’,
(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

meaning is that of ‘my friend(s)’ (as in 128a). The plural form is also used as an inter-
jection to convey empathy (as in 128b). It is not possible to replace gua ‘1SG.POSS’ with
any of the other possessor indexes to convey a different possessive relation (e.g., one
could not use gia ‘2SG.POSS’ in order to convey the meaning of ‘your friend(s)’).

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-

and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In

addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,

(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

The conjunction de not only introduces verbal clauses (as in the examples above), but
any kind of proposition. Example (44-4) illustrates a typical case. Such examples of-
ten look superficially like noun phrase coordination (e.g., ‘days and nights’ in this
case). However, in each case, there are indications that the linking continues to oper-
ate on a clausal level. For example, the content of the utterance in (44-4) is essentially
a condensed paraphrase of the content expressed in the three preceding clauses (in
44-1, 44-2 and 44-3). Syntactically, the propositions are often marked by particles or
adverbs, which do not operate on a phrasal level (e.g., the particle tika ‘EMPH’ in 44-
4). And prosodically, there is a boundary between the two units. Given all indications
together, utterances such as (44-4) are analyzed as a linking of two existential clauses
(which are not overtly marked in Qaqet; see section 8.2.1). On a functional level, there
is nevertheless some overlap with noun phrase coordination (see chapter 3.6 for de-
tails).

The conjunction de is furthermore used in a second context: as marking the boundary
between a left-dislocated element and the clause. Such left-dislocations are very fre-
quent in Qaqet discourse. Often, the left-dislocated element is a noun phrase that is
co-referential with the subject (as in 45a) or with any other argument of the verb (as
the prepositional object in 45b). It is even possible for more than one participant of
the event to be left-dislocated (as in 45c).

 Clause linking | 441
The left-dislocated elements do not function as arguments in the clause, as evidenced
by the distribution of argument indexing. In the case of direct objects, the index and
the direct object noun phrase are in complementary distribution (see chapter 5.2.1).
But a left-dislocated noun phrase can co-occur with an object index on the verb, e.g.,
the index ki ‘3SG.F’ and the dislocated noun phrase pick out the same referent in (46a).
In the case of subjects, the situation is slightly different, as subject noun phrases and
subject indexes co-occur. However, there are restrictions on subject noun phrases
consisting of independent pronouns (see chapter 3.2.2). In the case of dislocated noun
phrases, by contrast, no such restrictions apply, and any independent pronoun can
appear in this slot (as the pronoun ki ‘3SG.F’ in 46b).

Left-dislocation is not restricted to participants in an event, but is also found for all
other kinds of elements, including adverbs (as in 47a), prepositional phrases (as in
47b), and particles (as in 47c).

The second additive conjunction is be: it also serves to introduce subsequent events,
but it does not mark left-dislocated elements. This pattern is illustrated in (48). The
utterance in (48-2) starts a new episode, and the speaker uses be as part of the fixed
expression beip maget ‘and then’. The entire expression is left-dislocated, and the fol-
lowing clause is marked by the conjunction de – it is not possible for be to occur in
this second context.

While there is overlap between be and de in the sequencing of discourse, they have
subtly different meanings: be entails a close conceptual relationship between the se-
quences, while the semantics of de are more general, and do not give information
about the closeness of the relationship. By itself, de does not indicate a remote rela-
tionship – but as it pragmatically contrasts with be, it often receives such an interpre-
tation.

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

8.4 Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to Qaqet clause structure, covering
both verbal and non-verbal clauses. Non-verbal clauses are used extensively to con-
vey existence, location and direction, possession, equation and attribution. Note that
Qaqet does not make use of any copula in its non-verbal constructions. Instead, it
relies on syntax alone, juxtaposing the constituents.

less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

The conjunction is furthermore used in a second context: to introduce conditional
clauses. It is possible that this second use can be analyzed as a contextual interpreta-
tion of its basic purposive meaning. Most examples continue to allow for a purpose
reading (as in 66a). Nevertheless, there are cases where a purpose reading is no longer
obvious. For example, the person in (66b) does not intend to move the objects: she
intends to pick up the objects carefully, and the whole purpose is to not accidentally
touch and move any of the other objects. Such examples suggest that the conjunction
is developing a second, conditional, sense. There are very few such cases, though,
and there is always additional material that could trigger the conditional readings. In
(66b), it is probably the presence of ivit ‘upon (doing X)’ in the first clause. In fact, it
is very common for speakers to resort to the fixed expression ivit nani ip in conditional
contexts, as in (66c), which has a more literal translation of ‘upon spearing himself’
(see chapter 6.3 for a discussion of ivit). Another common collocation in this context
is ariq ip, as in (66d) (see also chapter 7.2).

98 | Nouns and the noun phrase
In non-verbal clauses (see chapter 8.2), free pronouns can occur as subjects (as in
35a). In verbal clauses, the free pronoun can co-occur with the obligatory subject in-
dex on the verb. There are two patterns. First, the free pronoun occurs in the same
prosodic unit as the verb and its subject index. In such cases, the pronouns behave
like noun phrases headed by nouns, and they can be analyzed as the subject of the
clause. This pattern is only attested with pronouns from one of the shape-based clas-
ses (as in 35b). Second, the pronoun is set apart prosodically and syntactically in its
own unit. In such cases, the pronoun arguably does not function as the subject. This
pattern is possible for all pronouns, and it is the only attested pattern for pronouns
that do not belong to any of the shape-based classes (as in 35c). Presumably, the dif-
ference in distribution follows from the fact that the pronouns from shape-based clas-
ses – just like common nouns – convey additional semantic information about the
referent. The other pronouns, by contrast, do not add information that is not already
coded in the subject index. As a result, speakers tend to use them for information
structural reasons, and hence mark them in special ways. It is possible that the 3DU.M
and 3DU.F pronouns distribute like the shape-based pronouns (as they add infor-
mation on the sex of the referent), but there are no relevant examples in the corpus.

The free pronouns presumably gave rise to the pronominal arguments: they share the
same forms and categories, and they only differ in their wordhood. The free pronouns
are independent words (that may or may not cliticize to surrounding elements), while
the pronominal arguments are suffixes. They are analyzed as suffixes (and not as en-
clitics) for two reasons. First, they invariably form a phonological word with the pre-
ceding preposition or verb. Qaqet clitics, by contrast, are more variable: the same
Heads of noun phrases | 99
form can usually be realized as either a proclitic or an enclitic, depending on the en-
vironment. And second, the pronominal arguments trigger phonological changes in
preceding elements that are otherwise only attested in suffixes, not in enclitics. Two
typical changes are illustrated in the examples below. In (36a), the basic preposition
is men ‘at’, but it appears in the form mena when followed by a pronominal object.
Similarly in (36b), the basic verb is raneng ‘hold.NCONT’, but it appears as ranenga
when followed by a pronominal object. I assume that the suffixed forms preserve the
original roots, in particular, I assume that they preserve final segments (very fre-
quently, a final vowel a, as in both examples below) that were lost in the non-suffixed
forms. The clearest evidence for such a diachronic scenario comes from nouns, and
this development is discussed in detail in chapter 4.1.1.

 ‘she wants to hold him’ (N11AAGSIRINIROPE-0066)
The pronominal arguments occur in three morphosyntactic contexts: as object argu-
ments of prepositions (as in 36a above and 37a below) (see chapter 5.3.1), as object
arguments of transitive verbs (as in 36b above and 37b below) (see chapter 5.2.1), and
as the single argument in the agentless construction (as in 37c below) (see chapter
5.2.2).

The pronouns and pronominal arguments code information about noun class and
number, and they are thus powerful tracking devices, which are commonly used to
100 | Nouns and the noun phrase
refer back to already established entities in discourse. For example, the pronoun irang
‘PL.DIM’ in (38a) occurs in subject function and refers back to the earlier introduced
noun uim-irang ‘child-PL.DIM’. Similarly in (38b), where the pronominal argument ini
‘SG.DIM’ functions as the argument of an agentless construction, referring back to
rlaun-ini ‘netbag-SG.DIM’.

3.2.4 Interrogative pronouns
Qaqet has two interrogative pronouns that function as heads of noun phrases: nem(a)
‘who’ (as in 40a) and gi ‘what’ (as in 40b). Both are overtly marked for noun class, but
speakers can also resort to an unmarked form if they do not intend to presuppose
anything about the identity (and hence the noun class) of the referent (as in 40c). In

addition, there is a third interrogative pronoun, kesna ‘how much, how many’ that
occurs in restricted nominal contexts only (see chapter 8.1.2).

",20.82796096801757,0,0.9054805877663384," This section presents the consonant phonemes in the following order: (i) voice-
less plosives, (ii) fricatives, (iii) voiced plosives, (iv) nasals, and (v) liquids.
(i) Voiceless plosives: /p/, /t/, /k/
Qaqet has three voiceless plosives that contrast with each other in all environments.
Table 5 gives (near-) minimal pairs for voiceless onsets and codas in the environment
of different vowels.

Phonetically, the voiceless plosives can be realized in different ways: released or un-
released, and aspirated or non-aspirated. Figure 1 exemplifies the most common re-
alizations by means of the following example:

Fig. 1: Typical realization of voiceless plosives (male speaker: AJL)
In syllable onset position (as exemplified with word-initial /k/ [kʰ] in Figure 1), voice-
less plosives are usually uttered released and aspirated – with a weak release burst
and a short period of aspiration. In word-internal coda position (as exemplified with
word-medial /p/ [p]), we still perceive a weak release burst, but usually no aspiration.
And in word-final coda position (as exemplified with word-final /p/ [p̚ ]), the plosives

often remain unreleased, and the place of articulation only leaves its traces in the
formants of the preceding vowels. For example, we observe a lowering of formants 1,
2 and 3 in Figure 1, which is taken to be indicative of vowels preceding a labial plosive
(following Ladefoged 2001: 48–52).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.

‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

(vi) nani ‘can’, (vii) kerl ‘DEONT’, and (viii) padi ‘hopefully.PST’ and padip ‘hope-
fully.FUT’.
(i) ani ‘maybe’
The particle ani ‘maybe’ is only infrequently attested in the corpus. It conveys a con-
siderable degree of uncertainty about the truth of a proposition (as in 8a). It is fur-
thermore attested in directives and hortatives, often combining with the particle kerl
‘DEONT’ in order to tone down a suggestion (as in 8b).

Given the above discussion, it is likely that the Qaqet particles – or at least a good
number of them – originated in verbs. Their verbal origin is visible in their retention
of some rudimentary verbal properties. The majority of synchronic particles, how-
ever, remain uninflected, and there is no evidence for (or against) a verbal origin.
Synchronically, particles thus have to be considered a distinct non-inflecting word
class that is syntactically defined by their fixed position in the left periphery of the
clause.
