3.3.1 Evidence for subjecthood and objecthood
From the above discussion and example sentences given so far, it is clear that word order in Gã
is strictly SVO, but so far the terms ‘subject’ and ‘object’ have been used without any real
justification. In order to determine whether Gã has the grammatical relations of subject and
object, there needs to be determined whether there are any syntactic phenomena that apply
equally to the arguments that have been labelled as subjects and which do not apply to those
arguments labelled as objects. In other words, are A and S arguments treated alike while P
arguments are treated differently in Gã? If the answer to this is affirmative, then Gã
grammatical relations are functionally similar to those in languages like English where A and S
undergo various syntactic phenomena from which P is excluded. A and S are then subjects and
P is object, giving a nominative-accusative case system.

is strictly SVO, but so far the terms ‘subject’ and ‘object’ have been used without any real
justification. In order to determine whether Gã has the grammatical relations of subject and
object, there needs to be determined whether there are any syntactic phenomena that apply
equally to the arguments that have been labelled as subjects and which do not apply to those
arguments labelled as objects. In other words, are A and S arguments treated alike while P
arguments are treated differently in Gã? If the answer to this is affirmative, then Gã
grammatical relations are functionally similar to those in languages like English where A and S
undergo various syntactic phenomena from which P is excluded. A and S are then subjects and
P is object, giving a nominative-accusative case system.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",0,0.6131471927654585," The syntactic behaviours in Gã that establish A and S as one grammatical relation

i) Word order
A and S arguments always occur before the verb while P occurs after the verb in the immediate
post-verbal position. As hinted at earlier, the A or S argument need not necessarily be an agent.
It may be a patient, instrument, recipient, location or benefactor. The P argument, on the other
hand, cannot be an agent. It is usually a patient, location or recipient. Switching the order of the
A and P arguments results in a different meaning. Example:
(205a) tsàtsú !tsɛ̃́ òkó

",50.76860046386719,5,1.0,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

",61.98885345458984,5,1.0,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive

object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose

This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

From the above discussion and example sentences given so far, it is clear that word order in Gã
is strictly SVO, but so far the terms ‘subject’ and ‘object’ have been used without any real
justification. In order to determine whether Gã has the grammatical relations of subject and
object, there needs to be determined whether there are any syntactic phenomena that apply
equally to the arguments that have been labelled as subjects and which do not apply to those
arguments labelled as objects. In other words, are A and S arguments treated alike while P
arguments are treated differently in Gã? If the answer to this is affirmative, then Gã
grammatical relations are functionally similar to those in languages like English where A and S
undergo various syntactic phenomena from which P is excluded. A and S are then subjects and
P is object, giving a nominative-accusative case system.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a

that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",53.60333251953125,0,0.6366824387328317," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.

In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or

languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and

",65.25676727294922,0,0.4294180549913118,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká
AkugiveOko money
“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient
(219b) ákú !hã́ lɛ̀shìká
Akugive3SG.OBJmoney
“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).
(221a) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó ni ́̃é=kpé lòò
Oko PROG-want NMLZ 3SG.SBJV=chew meat
“Oko wants to chew meat.”

"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

 b.",1,0.6810496732555991,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",49.76683044433594,0,0.6407874799137676,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",59.24080657958984,0,0.7227265726449518," 313
3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",60.099609375,0,0.8103675825505756,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",65.56556701660156,5,0.744825391469381,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

by more than one TAMP category, then these categories are mutually exclusive for the slot in
question. Also, slot 3, containing the negative subjunctive prefix ká- may occur only in the
presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic
component of motion.

role - and these roles may be marked morphologically or by word order. Languages differ in
how the marking of semantic roles in a typically transitive clause corresponds to the marking of
a single argument in an intransitive clause. This sets up the well-known binary division
between nominative-accusative languages and ergative-absolutive languages. In nominative-
accusative languages, the agent (A) of the transitive clause is marked the same as the single
argument (S) of an intransitive clause, while the patient (P) of the transitive clause receives
unique marking. In ergative-absolutive languages, it is the P of the transitive clause that is
marked the same as the S of the intransitive clause, with the A of the transitive clause being
uniquely marked.
",52.27005386352539,3,0.4178832517810212," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.

clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

",59.81394577026367,0,0.7230187459733773,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",65.29695129394531,5,0.7723304467790194,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical

different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.

In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent

word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

the verb word. There are three pre-head slots and two post-head slots. If a slot can be occupied
by more than one TAMP category, then these categories are mutually exclusive for the slot in
question. Also, slot 3, containing the negative subjunctive prefix ká- may occur only in the
presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic
component of motion.

have scope over all the verbs in the series.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",58.64714813232422,0,0.6567718321328935,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN

315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

",64.78856658935547,5,0.7931907707475587," The syntactic behaviours in Gã that establish A and S as one grammatical relation
distinct from P are word order, pronominalization, raising and indispensability of A and S.
These will be examined in turn.
 305
i) Word order
A and S arguments always occur before the verb while P occurs after the verb in the immediate
post-verbal position. As hinted at earlier, the A or S argument need not necessarily be an agent.
It may be a patient, instrument, recipient, location or benefactor. The P argument, on the other
hand, cannot be an agent. It is usually a patient, location or recipient. Switching the order of the
A and P arguments results in a different meaning. Example:
(205a) tsàtsú !tsɛ̃́ òkó
antsting Oko
“An ant stung Oko.”
(205b) òkó !tsɛ̃́tsàtsú
Okosting ant
“Oko stung an ant.”
",66.13957977294922,5,0.7526113003771381,"In terms of wordhood, Gã SVCs form separate grammatical and phonological words. In
a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2
such as the object of V1, the pronominal subject marker on V2 and any aspectual morphemes.
The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.
",37.86500549316406,0,0.537638429770426,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

 b.",53.42081832885742,1,0.634821070479564," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.
",51.73939895629883,0,0.4365912668823966,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",58.61880874633789,0,0.496989361949987,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit

Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",63.94786834716797,5,0.836388718507056,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.
",65.50794982910156,0,0.7153907384946728,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",37.600128173828125,5,0.5934747762847411," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

“So, after they have finished preparing the herbs…”",53.24643707275391,1,0.3940966063472644,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká

“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient

“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

between nominative-accusative languages and ergative-absolutive languages. In nominative-
accusative languages, the agent (A) of the transitive clause is marked the same as the single
argument (S) of an intransitive clause, while the patient (P) of the transitive clause receives

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",65.75088500976562,0,0.5568587812876789,"In terms of wordhood, Gã SVCs form separate grammatical and phonological words. In
a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2
such as the object of V1, the pronominal subject marker on V2 and any aspectual morphemes.
The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.
",69.02178192138672,0,0.5867205214244479," The syntactic behaviours in Gã that establish A and S as one grammatical relation
distinct from P are word order, pronominalization, raising and indispensability of A and S.
These will be examined in turn.
 305
i) Word order
A and S arguments always occur before the verb while P occurs after the verb in the immediate
post-verbal position. As hinted at earlier, the A or S argument need not necessarily be an agent.
It may be a patient, instrument, recipient, location or benefactor. The P argument, on the other
hand, cannot be an agent. It is usually a patient, location or recipient. Switching the order of the
A and P arguments results in a different meaning. Example:
(205a) tsàtsú !tsɛ̃́ òkó
antsting Oko
“An ant stung Oko.”
(205b) òkó !tsɛ̃́tsàtsú

“Oko stung an ant.”

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",65.30231475830078,5,0.7582604958419253,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable

not be possible (220b):

iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",46.60073471069336,0,0.6007507937073548,"Each argument in a clause plays a role in the development of the action - a semantic
role - and these roles may be marked morphologically or by word order. Languages differ in
how the marking of semantic roles in a typically transitive clause corresponds to the marking of
a single argument in an intransitive clause. This sets up the well-known binary division
between nominative-accusative languages and ergative-absolutive languages. In nominative-
accusative languages, the agent (A) of the transitive clause is marked the same as the single
argument (S) of an intransitive clause, while the patient (P) of the transitive clause receives
unique marking. In ergative-absolutive languages, it is the P of the transitive clause that is
marked the same as the S of the intransitive clause, with the A of the transitive clause being
uniquely marked.
",50.218074798583984,3,0.5601755096098502,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",58.62050628662109,5,0.6032906639396268,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",45.350189208984375,0,0.7830487300727634,"The template in table 8 shows verbal morphemes and the order in which they appear in
the verb word. There are three pre-head slots and two post-head slots. If a slot can be occupied
by more than one TAMP category, then these categories are mutually exclusive for the slot in
question. Also, slot 3, containing the negative subjunctive prefix ká- may occur only in the
presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic
component of motion.
",51.5127182006836,1,0.4469016913593053,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon

i) Word order

verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",58.0996208190918,0,0.5320820806031608," The syntactic behaviours in Gã that establish A and S as one grammatical relation

 305
i) Word order
A and S arguments always occur before the verb while P occurs after the verb in the immediate
post-verbal position. As hinted at earlier, the A or S argument need not necessarily be an agent.
It may be a patient, instrument, recipient, location or benefactor. The P argument, on the other
hand, cannot be an agent. It is usually a patient, location or recipient. Switching the order of the
A and P arguments results in a different meaning. Example:
(205a) tsàtsú !tsɛ̃́ òkó
antsting Oko
“An ant stung Oko.”
(205b) òkó !tsɛ̃́tsàtsú
Okosting ant
“Oko stung an ant.”
",58.33523941040039,5,0.5262304258959711,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

b)ònúkpá-!í

‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

",38.33699035644531,0,0.7693449716901739,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well

3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",51.17644500732422,5,0.5116451543496581," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):

“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀

iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",59.76967239379883,1,0.7572590893794474,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",56.575904846191406,5,0.6429648119044473," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",64.42003631591797,0,0.7373604326819049," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",58.16838073730469,0,0.5818617098242116," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.
",62.40215301513672,0,0.563552896157287,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

",67.98393249511719,0,0.6319027116844285," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.
",69.19075012207031,0,0.6057857105391856
"Each argument in a clause plays a role in the development of the action - a semantic
role - and these roles may be marked morphologically or by word order. Languages differ in
how the marking of semantic roles in a typically transitive clause corresponds to the marking of
a single argument in an intransitive clause. This sets up the well-known binary division
between nominative-accusative languages and ergative-absolutive languages. In nominative-
accusative languages, the agent (A) of the transitive clause is marked the same as the single
argument (S) of an intransitive clause, while the patient (P) of the transitive clause receives
unique marking. In ergative-absolutive languages, it is the P of the transitive clause that is
marked the same as the S of the intransitive clause, with the A of the transitive clause being
uniquely marked.
",3,0.6056772277667669,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",52.03168487548828,0,0.6251898502868906," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to

expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit

3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",49.73118591308594,5,0.6024035672737704,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",57.82344818115234,5,0.64378763758898,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath

inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",67.90228271484375,1,0.6366673071574913,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká
AkugiveOko money
“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient
(219b) ákú !hã́ lɛ̀shìká
Akugive3SG.OBJmoney
“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).
(221a) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó ni ́̃é=kpé lòò
Oko PROG-want NMLZ 3SG.SBJV=chew meat
“Oko wants to chew meat.”
(221b) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó lòòini ̃́ é=kpéØi
Oko PROG-want meatNMLZ3SG.SBJV=chew3SG.OBJ
“Oko wants meat to chew.”

" Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",57.2770881652832,0,0.7352248058459475,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.
",59.47383117675781,0,0.7509538146912792,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",61.98448944091797,0,0.7698869441123707,"The template in table 8 shows verbal morphemes and the order in which they appear in
the verb word. There are three pre-head slots and two post-head slots. If a slot can be occupied
by more than one TAMP category, then these categories are mutually exclusive for the slot in
question. Also, slot 3, containing the negative subjunctive prefix ká- may occur only in the
presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic
component of motion.
",63.5416145324707,1,0.7439808152676342,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",49.57514953613281,0,0.6174224479562043,"In terms of wordhood, Gã SVCs form separate grammatical and phonological words. In
a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2
such as the object of V1, the pronominal subject marker on V2 and any aspectual morphemes.
The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.
",46.33757400512695,0,0.5299194815633523,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.
",49.27146911621094,1,0.6073433331014034,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical

same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English

arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.

In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical

different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",56.449317932128906,0,0.6278018328199343," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an

word will not apply recursively.
",57.32761764526367,0,0.5727415888080866,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).

Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):

“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”

“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

",5,0.6508102506055039," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",58.5024299621582,1,0.7539330803367464," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

",55.60897064208984,0,0.6806370389426134,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",56.63414764404297,5,0.7052093933134052,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation

in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.
",48.96623611450195,0,0.6000778649511099,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká
AkugiveOko money
“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient
(219b) ákú !hã́ lɛ̀shìká
Akugive3SG.OBJmoney
“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).
(221a) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó ni ́̃é=kpé lòò
Oko PROG-want NMLZ 3SG.SBJV=chew meat
“Oko wants to chew meat.”
(221b) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó lòòini ̃́ é=kpéØi
Oko PROG-want meatNMLZ3SG.SBJV=chew3SG.OBJ
“Oko wants meat to chew.”
",57.32085037231445,5,0.6879969346848904,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",51.57387924194336,5,0.5368122785628373," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

 “The women are singing.”
̀ =bé-ɔ̀
(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́
 3PL=quarrel-HABtoo.much
 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",55.83119201660156,1,0.5778527544524151," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",64.8133544921875,0,0.6307765525065645,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká
AkugiveOko money
“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient
(219b) ákú !hã́ lɛ̀shìká
Akugive3SG.OBJmoney
“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).
(221a) òkóŋ̀-tá!ó ni ́̃é=kpé lòò

“Oko wants meat to chew.”

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.
(12)òkó á-ká-tũ̀è=bó!ténṹ=ɛ̃̀ miŋ̀̃̀
Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the

arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.

because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",55.50832748413086,5,0.7305226512369469,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",63.37378692626953,1,0.7381404244487934," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

i) Word order
A and S arguments always occur before the verb while P occurs after the verb in the immediate
post-verbal position. As hinted at earlier, the A or S argument need not necessarily be an agent.
It may be a patient, instrument, recipient, location or benefactor. The P argument, on the other
hand, cannot be an agent. It is usually a patient, location or recipient. Switching the order of the
A and P arguments results in a different meaning. Example:

phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",56.23224258422852,0,0.613127692545089,"The syntactic tests that will be used to determine which of the two objects aligns more
with the direct object of a monotransitive construction are word order, pronominalization, equi-
NP reference in complementation and to some extent, focalization. The first two phenomena
are considered coding patterns while the rest are behavioural patterns (Malchukov et. al
2010:10).
i) Word order
Since in a monotransitive clause the argument in immediate post-verbal position is the direct
object, we may posit then that in a ditransitive clause the argument in this position is also the
direct object. This by itself is not conclusive evidence as there are other languages like English
314
where the reverse obtains i.e. the argument immediately following the verb is the indirect
object and the one furthest from the verb is the direct object. Therefore, more supporting
evidence is needed.
ii) Pronominalization
When this test is applied, we see that only the post-verbal object most proximal to the verb, the
R, is capable of being pronominalized. This argument takes the pronominal form that a direct
object in a monotransitive clause would take. For example, in (219b), the immediate post-
verbal object (R) - Oko - is pronominalized with lɛ̀. The second object (T) in the ditransitive
clause, shìká ‘money’, by contrast, cannot be pronominalized (219c).
(219a) ákú !hã́ òkó shìká

“Aku gave Oko money”
Pronominalization of recipient

“Aku gave him money”
Pronominalization of theme
(219c) *ákú!hã́ òkó Ø
AkugiveOko 3SG.OBJ.INAN
“Aku gave it to Oko”
315
Even if the T were a third person that was high on the animacy hierarchy and therefore capable
of being pronominalized overtly, as in the animate theme gbèé ‘dog’ in (220a) , it still would
not be possible (220b):
(220a) ákúkèòkó gbèé
Aku giftOko dog
“Aku gifted Oko a dog.”
(220b) *ákú kèòkó lɛ̀
Aku giftOko 3SG.OBJ
“Aku gifted him to Oko”
iii) Equi-NP reference in purpose complementation
This is the strongest evidence that the argument immediately posterior to the verb is the direct
object. An event nominalization may function as an NP expressing purpose (221a). When the
main verb is a modal verb such as tá!ó ‘want’, the object of the verb in the purpose
nominalization may be raised to become the object of the main verb (221b).

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",55.68053817749024,0,0.6270897462219089,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.
",61.57133102416992,0,0.5989282248307946,"*Coordinate: “S/he and her/him are going home.”
In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural
pronoun in subject position.

3SG=take Ama 3PL=PROG-gohome
“He and Ama, they are going home.”
In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.
",64.2867202758789,1,0.6350408243257417,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",67.63520050048828,0,0.6731835474901903," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or

nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to

word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",47.970550537109375,1,0.6780829121695666," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL

c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",56.00341033935547,1,0.7211909252365128,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",58.428955078125,0,0.7368971463427353,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.
",54.5769157409668,0,0.7223584344320061,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

 “The women are singing.”

(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́

 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",63.02976608276367,0,0.7298910724985328," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",32.79419708251953,0,0.5995511330656409,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",48.36412811279297,5,0.7092323853618874,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

",50.18831634521485,5,0.5661752911415939,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.

In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",55.38977813720703,0,0.6218966721017515,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

 b.",55.53578567504883,1,0.6312573379529454,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",61.45367431640625,0,0.5922346885388843," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",67.5019302368164,0,0.6439894069529113
"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.

However, the following well-formed sentences have no object.
(214) yè-í=ɛ̀ ŋ̀-lá
 woman-PL=DEF PROG-sing
 “The women are singing.”
̀ =bé-ɔ̀
(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́
 3PL=quarrel-HABtoo.much
 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́
 Oko gift1SG.OBJ neck-thing
 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”
312
(217) kɛ̀kɛ́=!ɛ́ á=wò nyɛ̃̀àtàlé fine
then=TOP 3PL.IMPERS.PERF=wear 2PLdress
“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",37.34430313110352,0,0.7267787504435634," 313
3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",47.96808624267578,0,0.6780829121695666," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.
(275) *fã-ã̀ ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=fã ̀gbɛ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=kɛ̀-yà-táòshìká
 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .
(276) shi ̀̃ni ́̃ ̀̃
 i=yà-fó=!ɛ́hèwɔ̀ è=miŋ̀̀̃ é-!fṹ=!ɛ̃́
 down NMLZ 1SG=ITIV-cut=DEF sake3SG=inside PERF-swell=DEF
 “The wandering (about town) that I did is what has angered her.”
",55.26765441894531,0,0.7211909252365128,"399
In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.
(12)òkó á-ká-tũ̀è=bó!ténṹ=ɛ̃̀ miŋ̀̃̀
Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",58.260379791259766,0,0.7368971463427353,"In this chapter, I will apply Shibatani’s inclusive methodology to Gã in order to
determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.
",54.5360107421875,0,0.7223584344320061,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",56.30022430419922,5,0.7440486713347987," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

 “So when the herbal infusion has been prepared and put down…”",62.34012222290039,0,0.7298910724985328,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",32.489864349365234,0,0.5995511330656409," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2
such as the object of V1, the pronominal subject marker on V2 and any aspectual morphemes.
The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.
",48.13516616821289,0,0.6423977418965007,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́
 Oko gift1SG.OBJ neck-thing
 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”
312
(217) kɛ̀kɛ́=!ɛ́ á=wò nyɛ̃̀àtàlé fine
then=TOP 3PL.IMPERS.PERF=wear 2PLdress
“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",37.03447341918945,0,0.6255548045046221," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.
",41.85401153564453,0,0.7168197432949408," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",47.6304817199707,1,0.6214765870505591,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form

complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X

may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",62.28318786621094,0,0.7298910724985328,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to

expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit

Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to

expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”
́ ̀ ni ̀̃

who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

",36.52671051025391,0,0.6255548045046221," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.
",41.67586135864258,0,0.7168197432949408,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",48.36993789672852,0,0.6896831798244301,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",54.35229110717773,1,0.6391598629442145,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.

It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another

discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite

of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",36.77153015136719,1,0.7373483156635522," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these

to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",43.47098922729492,0,0.6330894855407444,"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.
",49.39786911010742,5,0.6190231172415379," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus

Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

",43.22537612915039,0,0.6754585452848885,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.
",55.36270904541016,0,0.6312573379529454,"*Coordinate: “S/he and her/him are going home.”
In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural
pronoun in subject position.
(102) è=kɛ̀́
 ã!mã́ ãmɛ̃
 ̀ =ŋ̀
 ̀ -yà ̃́ ́
shi!ã
3SG=take Ama 3PL=PROG-gohome
“He and Ama, they are going home.”
In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.
",60.67845916748047,1,0.6137591032727645,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",63.12919235229492,0,0.638898548293964,"399
In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.
",66.41840362548828,0,0.6877908509960201," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.
(10a) è=sà á!kɛ́ é=kɛ́ɛ ́bò

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.
",55.01720428466797,0,0.7548023625713948," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its

It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

In a negative subjunctive SVC, however, the negative morpheme ka- is marked just once on the
first verb. All other verbs are unmarked. However, the negative morpheme is understood to
have scope over all the verbs in the series.

Oko SBJV-NEG.SBJV-jump 3SG=enterwater=DEF inside
“Oko shouldn’t jump into the water.”
As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified

inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

the verb and then fronting it.

The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based

pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",31.520694732666016,1,0.6635632491545387," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into

formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",48.63743209838867,0,0.6190231172415379,"Many linguists agree that the head noun and the so-called relative clause or sentence
together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.
",42.92258071899414,5,0.726676844814474,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.
",48.95858383178711,1,0.6240643022152793,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be

phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form

complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena

terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified

inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.
",53.74245071411133,0,0.7643107899978895," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

",47.17177963256836,1,0.6291215532348479,"Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the word, word classes and their associated
morphology. Gã has all the major word classes: nouns, verbs and adjectives. It has bound
subject pronominal clitics and free object pronominals. Property concepts are expressed mainly
by verbs and nouns. Ideophones are very common and belong to the adverb, adjective and noun
classes. Chapter 3 is dedicated to verbs. Verbal categories are conveyed primarily by affixation.
Gã is an aspectual language with a recently established future time
prefix that is becoming more tense-like. Gã is nominative-accusative with highly transitive
clauses and an indispensable subject. Chapter 4 discusses serial verb constructions. These were
found to be pervasive and an important means of achieving valency changes and carrying out
aspectual functions. As a result, morphological operations to alter valency are few. Major voice
categories are manifested mainly through periphrastic means (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 looks at
nominalizations generally. In Gã, grammatical nominalizations have functions ranging from
relativization to complementation and adverbial modification. Topic and focus constructions are
examined in the final chapter. Focus constructions are utilized for contrast and emphasis. Topic
constructions are made up almost entirely of left-dislocated constructions. They may also mark
contrast, and are used discursively to highlight background information.
",42.90606689453125,0,0.726676844814474," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

young.ladyINDEF
‘a certain young woman’ [DF:119]
 d. lɔ́lèyɛ̃ŋ́́ =!ɛ̃́

‘the white car’
Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",48.77629089355469,1,0.6341627382085893," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.
",53.31026840209961,0,0.6920076890441585,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.

 kpékplé-!ɛ́ hṹ tsùlù
1PL=FUT-do kpekple-DEF toored
“We’ll make the kpékplè̀ too red.”
2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’
(a) lɔ́lè ̀
glá!sé=!ɛ́é-mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́
car glass=DEF PERF-mangle
“The window of the car is mangled’
(b) àtàlé mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
(253) tsɛ́!lɛ́ ‘tear (ITER)’ tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ̀ì‘torn, tattered’
(a) ó=tàlé=!ɛ́é-tsɛ́-!lɛ́
2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó
 quiet COPKojo
 “Kojo is quiet.”
7
The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.
",54.75422286987305,0,0.6312573379529454," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",60.0168571472168,1,0.6238575392660746,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

"[CH:232]
ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute

isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",53.6390380859375,1,0.7742739905404957,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",54.35197830200195,0,0.7548023625713948,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",60.02523422241211,0,0.766135937132634," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

“So, after they have finished preparing the herbs…”",42.90514755249024,1,0.7366400453570803,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

“They are returning.”",47.54155349731445,0,0.6852283808262779," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

However, the following well-formed sentences have no object.
(214) yè-í=ɛ̀ ŋ̀-lá
 woman-PL=DEF PROG-sing
 “The women are singing.”
̀ =bé-ɔ̀
(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́
 3PL=quarrel-HABtoo.much
 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́
 Oko gift1SG.OBJ neck-thing
 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”
312
(217) kɛ̀kɛ́=!ɛ́ á=wò nyɛ̃̀àtàlé fine
then=TOP 3PL.IMPERS.PERF=wear 2PLdress
“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",47.75849151611328,0,0.6999268397303472,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",53.17570114135742,0,0.6920076890441585," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

However, the following well-formed sentences have no object.
(214) yè-í=ɛ̀ ŋ̀-lá
 woman-PL=DEF PROG-sing
 “The women are singing.”
̀ =bé-ɔ̀
(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́
 3PL=quarrel-HABtoo.much
 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",59.6933479309082,1,0.6338207398086807," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",62.32989883422852,1,0.6591054087424872,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",0,0.7091927509164178," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2

The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.
",61.36489486694336,0,0.7298910724985328,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

together form one NP (Givón 2001b, Andrews 2007, Lehmann 1986). One problem that
Shibatani (2011) has with this view is that if it is maintained that the argument nominalization
is actually a clause, it entertains a scenario where a larger, more complex structure (a clause) is
embedded within a smaller structure (a noun phrase). This is impossible and it entreats us to
search for a more syntactically sound analysis of relative constructions. This, I believe is the
nominalization analysis put forward by Shibatani.
6.4 Verb-based argument nominalizations in modification function (Relative
clauses)
In Gã, the verb based argument nominalization is marked at the initial boundary by the
nominalizer, ni,̃́ an invariant particle. It is the most important nominalizer in Gã and is found in
various other grammatical nominalizations which carry out a variety of functions, such as
complementation and adverbial modification. When the nominalized argument is subject or
object, the argument nominalization has a gap in the position where that grammatical relation
531
would be. Recall that Gã has strict SVO word order and grammatical relations are determined
primarily by word order.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,

Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different

formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other

coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",54.15785217285156,5,0.6818345962347048," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",54.434513092041016,0,0.6312573379529454,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",59.52799987792969,0,0.6338207398086807,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.

mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,

example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",54.10268783569336,3,0.7839576567231595," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

i=kɛ̀-yà-táòshìká
 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",61.36373901367188,1,0.7396095038824543," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.

",44.19941711425781,1,0.6388399846187696,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

",40.49616241455078,1,0.8200914792835549," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",45.65235900878906,0,0.6814145111835124," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.

marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full

2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",54.10770034790039,0,0.6818345962347048," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó
 quiet COPKojo
 “Kojo is quiet.”
7
The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

However, the following well-formed sentences have no object.
(214) yè-í=ɛ̀ ŋ̀-lá
 woman-PL=DEF PROG-sing
 “The women are singing.”
̀ =bé-ɔ̀
(215) ãmɛ̃̀tsɔ̃́
 3PL=quarrel-HABtoo.much
 “They quarrel too much”
 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́
 Oko gift1SG.OBJ neck-thing
 “Oko gifted me a necklace.”
312
(217) kɛ̀kɛ́=!ɛ́ á=wò nyɛ̃̀àtàlé fine
then=TOP 3PL.IMPERS.PERF=wear 2PLdress
“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",65.56298065185547,0,0.6877908509960201," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.
(275) *fã-ã̀ ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=fã ̀gbɛ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=kɛ̀-yà-táòshìká
 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .
(276) shi ̀̃ni ́̃ ̀̃
 i=yà-fó=!ɛ́hèwɔ̀ è=miŋ̀̀̃ é-!fṹ=!ɛ̃́

"In terms of wordhood, Gã SVCs form separate grammatical and phonological words. In
a two-verb SVC, for instance, there may be several elements intervening between V1 and V2
such as the object of V1, the pronominal subject marker on V2 and any aspectual morphemes.
The verbs in the SVC may also be formally marked for different aspectual categories.
",0,0.7189111823003393,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.
(251) *wɔ̀=bàá-féé̀
 kpékplé-!ɛ́ hṹ tsùlù
1PL=FUT-do kpekple-DEF toored
“We’ll make the kpékplè̀ too red.”
2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’
(a) lɔ́lè ̀
glá!sé=!ɛ́é-mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́
car glass=DEF PERF-mangle
“The window of the car is mangled’
(b) àtàlé mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
(253) tsɛ́!lɛ́ ‘tear (ITER)’ tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ̀ì‘torn, tattered’
(a) ó=tàlé=!ɛ́é-tsɛ́-!lɛ́
2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó
 quiet COPKojo
 “Kojo is quiet.”
7
The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.
",46.02986145019531,0,0.7406533877041319,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",54.21088790893555,5,0.8302818038986943," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

",56.75203323364258,0,0.7854893032623432,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",37.6441535949707,0,0.652906352917976," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate

the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X

",65.34920501708984,1,0.697397997506685,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100

only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form

",45.99557495117188,0,0.7406533877041319,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.

Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which

property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",54.20635223388672,0,0.8302818038986943,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16

leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì

“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó

 “Kojo is quiet.”

The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.
",34.76504135131836,0,0.718226826555378,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:
(216) òkókèmi ̃̀ kùɛ̀-ni!ĩ́ ̃́

“…then you will be dressed in fine clothes.”",45.07174682617188,0,0.6814145111835124,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

",52.92992401123047,0,0.7934947161414339,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

",43.8739128112793,0,0.7583298058288045," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.
(5) a) ́
è=nyɛ̃-!ŋ́
3SG=be.able-NEG.FUT
‘S/he will not be able (to do it)’
b)ònúkpá-!í
elder-PL
‘elders’
c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",41.561031341552734,1,0.7555456083231574,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",54.94673156738281,0,0.7258676618431498," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.
",48.90249633789063,0,0.6989650076514767,"It is hoped that this snapshot of Gã interjections and the power that they possess in
communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not

subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

",47.822242736816406,0,0.6936971723055417,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",52.45757293701172,0,0.7017261204280801," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.
",53.47904968261719,1,0.6912378649837655,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",53.86163711547852,5,0.6877759759152654,"If a grammatical word is a noun with plural number, then the final boundary may be
identified by the plural morphemes -ì, -ji,̃̀ -bí!í and -mɛ̀ì since these always occur finally. For
verbs, the verb head itself or the post-verbal affixes such as the habitual -ɔ, and negative
perfect kò will mark the final boundary of the grammatical word. The initial boundary is
marked by the bound pronouns if the subject is a pronominal. If the subject of the verb is a full
NP then the initial boundary of the verb complex is marked either by the verb itself or the
perfect prefix é-.
2.1.4 Clitics
It is important to recognize a small class of elements in Gã which correspond to what have
been described in other languages as clitics. Matthews (1991:218) writes that clitics “are units
which are word-like in their grammar, but phonologically must lean for support…on another
word adjacent to them.” Clitics therefore share characteristics with both words and affixes and
are considered by many (e.g. Haspelmath 2011; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002) to be
grammatical words. Whereas a particular affix must occur with words of a particular syntactic
category and in a particular order, clitics have no such restriction. They may attach to different
classes of words and have variable word order. In Gã, there are two classes of clitics: subject
 45
pronominals and articles. The former are proclitics while the latter are enclitics. These will be
discussed in detail in §2.3.2.1 on subject pronominal clitics (bound pronouns) and §2.3.1.2 on
articles. For now, a brief discussion with examples will suffice.
Articles:- The definite and indefinite articles lɛ and ko are clitics. They occur after the noun
phrases they modify and form a phonological word with their host noun phrases. The definite
article, in spoken Gã, is hardly realized as lɛ. It has the allomorphs -ɛ, -a, or -ɔ, the realization
of which is dependent on the final phoneme of the noun phrase. Like true clitics, they exhibit
low selectivity of hosts and so they attach to the last word of the noun phrase, regardless of its
syntactic category. It is attached to a noun in (6a) and (6c), a nominalization marker in (6b) and
an adjective in (6d). In chapter 7, it will be shown that the definite article also functions as a
marker of topicality.

meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.

than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

",56.61113739013672,0,0.7948925720114038," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).
",53.7538948059082,1,0.7932671980681197," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",58.7918701171875,0,0.8041825899590874," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",60.68407440185547,0,0.7396095038824543,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

“They are returning.”",27.878963470458984,0,0.7127474820508958,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and
free pronouns on the other is that whereas free pronouns and object pronouns may be modified
by the additive adverb hṹ ‘too’ and the quantifier, fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, the subject pronominals cannot. So
(121) is grammatical because it is the object pronoun that is modified by fɛ̃ɛ́ ̃́ ‘all’, but (122),
where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.
",54.70772933959961,0,0.7258676618431498,"321
In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

the verb and then fronting it.

 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

 “So when the herbal infusion has been prepared and put down…”",53.24694061279297,0,0.6912378649837655," 43
In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

b)ònúkpá-!í

c)jù-lɔ̀-ì

d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.

Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.

“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

 “We will show it to God, so that he blesses these herbs.” [YM:78]
Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.

(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́

“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to

verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X

may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

“So, after they have finished preparing the herbs…”",56.096458435058594,1,0.8040287521864067,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",52.75345993041992,0,0.7934947161414339,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",53.72267532348633,0,0.8024878461839888,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",58.1392707824707,0,0.8041825899590874," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an

For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",54.60634994506836,0,0.7258676618431498," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",33.706111907958984,0,0.7275363679003382," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",38.60063552856445,0,0.8200914792835549,"*Coordinate: “S/he and her/him are going home.”
In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural
pronoun in subject position.
(102) è=kɛ̀́
 ã!mã́ ãmɛ̃
 ̀ =ŋ̀
 ̀ -yà ̃́ ́
shi!ã
3SG=take Ama 3PL=PROG-gohome
“He and Ama, they are going home.”
In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.
",43.80679321289063,1,0.6905506913585151,"It is hoped that this snapshot of Gã interjections and the power that they possess in
communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

Barring special discourse contexts such as phone conversations and letters, an exchange in which the subject is
first person and the object is second person takes place in one and the same location.

 When the prospective marker occurs with the first singular pronoun, the first vowel of the prospective marker is
elided.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",53.09366607666016,0,0.7004585130996345,"*Coordinate: “S/he and her/him are going home.”
In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural
pronoun in subject position.

3SG=take Ama 3PL=PROG-gohome
“He and Ama, they are going home.”
In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",58.33855819702149,0,0.6893272491370864,"In this chapter, I will apply Shibatani’s inclusive methodology to Gã in order to
determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.
",60.96282196044922,0,0.7164537264068414," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical

for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",53.18363952636719,0,0.8302818038986943,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",55.8708610534668,5,0.8493076298812602," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

",59.81402587890625,0,0.7672714482300613,"Another difference between the subject pronominal clitics on one hand and object and

where the subject proclitic takes the modifier is not grammatical. In order for a subject
pronominal to take on such qualifiers, free pronouns must be employed. These can be modified
100
and left-dislocated and then can be followed by the subject pronominal clitic, as in (123). The
inability of the subject clitics to be modified shows that they are not quite like ordinary words.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode

them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",46.5716667175293,0,0.7537381916172216,"In this chapter, I will apply Shibatani’s inclusive methodology to Gã in order to
determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.
(10a) è=sà á!kɛ́ é=kɛ́ɛ ́bò

 “He has to tell you.”

“Everything that you need to be told, he should tell you.”",48.33893585205078,5,0.7442438853463302," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

i=kɛ̀-yà-táòshìká
 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

 “The wandering (about town) that I did is what has angered her.”
",33.59206771850586,0,0.7275363679003382,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",38.11561584472656,0,0.8200914792835549," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

c)jù-lɔ̀-ì

d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",58.12639617919922,0,0.6893272491370864,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",64.6058578491211,0,0.7066186456225539,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",0,0.7284134765173559,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.

“We’ll make the kpékplè̀ too red.”
2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’
(a) lɔ́lè ̀
glá!sé=!ɛ́é-mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́
car glass=DEF PERF-mangle
“The window of the car is mangled’
(b) àtàlé mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́

“a tattered dress”
(253) tsɛ́!lɛ́ ‘tear (ITER)’ tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ̀ì‘torn, tattered’
(a) ó=tàlé=!ɛ́é-tsɛ́-!lɛ́
2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó
 quiet COPKojo
 “Kojo is quiet.”

The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.

“So, after they have finished preparing the herbs…”",52.54232406616211,1,0.8024738285792924,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",53.55958938598633,0,0.8115436217229595,"*Coordinate: “S/he and her/him are going home.”
In order to express the coordinate meaning when at least one of the actors is a pronoun, the
coordinate NP must be topicalized by left-dislocation and followed by the third person plural
pronoun in subject position.

“He and Ama, they are going home.”
In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both

",31.241214752197266,1,0.6898140893907153,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",36.15167617797852,0,0.6667686086536502," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is

Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger

"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",0,0.7284134765173559,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.
",33.59099197387695,5,0.861688271739125,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé

 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

 “They say, “No news is good news.”
",26.62928771972656,0,0.7585247190113641,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",53.74537658691406,3,0.7525853731046089,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",47.983306884765625,0,0.7442438853463302,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.
(298a) àbìfáó=!ɛ́é-shwìàgbò

“The baby is very fat.”
(298b) ?àbìfáó=!ɛ́ é-!shwí-kòàgbò

(299b) ?tsó=ɛ̀é-kɛ́ɛɛ́ ́kàkàdãŋ́ ŋ́ ́
tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall
“The tree is not very tall.”
2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

",43.80942153930664,0,0.7660622276803596," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

Bound pronouns:- These are clitics and they will be discussed in detail in §2.3.2. Bound
pronouns in Gã are only found in subject position. They are always the first morpheme in the
verb complex, if there is no full NP subject.
2.1.5 Affixes
Affixes are morphemes which cannot occur in isolation and which convey grammatical or
semantic information about the stem to which they attach. They are neither phonological words
nor grammatical words. They do not belong to any syntactic category and are restricted as to
where they occur and in what order; a particular affix attaches only to words of a particular
syntactic category e.g. aspect markers can only attach to verbs. Verbs generally exhibit more
affixation than other word classes. Specific affixes and the functions they carry out will be
examined as part of the discussion on the word class they occur with.
2.1.6 Grammatical words consisting of phonological words
Compound words are an example of grammatical words that are made up of more than one
phonological word. They are considered one grammatical word because they take only one
inflectional affix e.g. only one plural suffix. Examples are:
(7) a.shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́ shiã̃́ ̀ wùɔ́-!í
house chicken house chicken-PL
‘local chicken’ ‘local chickens’
47
b.yàlà-bò yàlà-bò-ì
funeral-clothfuneral-cloth-PL
‘funeral cloth’‘funeral cloths’
c.ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké ŋ̀shɔ̀-ké-!í
ocean-pile ocean-pile-PL
‘ocean wave’ ‘ocean waves’
2.1.7 Phonological words consisting of grammatical words
A clitic and its host are an example of two grammatical words that make up a phonological
word e.g. a pronominal subject clitic and the verb complex it attaches to, as in (8).
(8) è=bàá-gbó
3SG=FUT-die
“S/he will die.”
Also, a possessive NP consisting of a pronominal clitic possessor and its NP host, the possessed
entity (e.g. è=mãm ̀ i ̃́ ‘3SG=mother’, ‘his mother’). And finally, an NP host and the definite or
indefinite article clitic that follows it also constitute one phonological word comprising two
grammatical words (example 6).
2.1.8 Grammatical words that coincide with phonological words
There are many words in Gã wich constitute a single grammatical word as well as a single
phonological word. According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:24), these are words that can
stand in isolation as an utterance. In Gã, the grammatical word and the phonological word
coincide frequently; as long as they are made up of only one word component. That is, all
 48
single phonological words are also grammatical words and all single grammatical words are
also phonological words. So, for instance tsù-ɔ̀ (be.red-HAB) ‘be light-skinned’ is both a
grammatical and phonological word but è=ninè ̃̀ (3SG=hand) ‘his hand’ is a phonological
word made up of two grammatical words; è ‘3SG’ and ninè ̃̀ ‘hand’. One must also bear in mind
 ̃̀ ‘hand’ is at the same time a phonological word. So, the only time a phonological
that ninè
word is not a grammatical word is when it consists of more than one word. Likewise, the only
time a grammatical word is not one phonological word as well is when it consists of more than
one word, as in the case of compounds (example 7).

Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate

the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X

This discourse-pragmatic use of the recent perfect has been described for English by Nishiyama
and Koenig (2006) and is termed by them as “commonsense entailment”.
3.2.2.4.3 Perfect of persistent situation
In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present
(Comrie 1976:60). This is seen in (105) and (106), for example.

3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

2.2 Word Classes
In order to identify word classes in Gã, I will be relying mostly on distributional evidence, with
support from morphological and semantic criteria. Utilizing the distributional method is
unproblematic from a language-particular point of view. However, in order to define word
classes universally (and by this is meant only the major classes of nouns, verbs and adjectives),
other criteria need to be looked at, since the morphosyntax of one language differs from the
next. Some linguists are of the view that there are languages which lack one or more of these
word classes. For instance, some Austronesian, Salishan and Iroquian languages are said to lack
verbs (Haspelmath (2012:118). However, some linguists, such as Croft (2000) and Haspelmath
(2012) maintain that all languages possess these three word classes or parts of speech.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.

",59.75120544433594,0,0.7609832451759398,"Although these are not SVCs, it is appropriate to discuss this construction type here
because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some

nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

Barring special discourse contexts such as phone conversations and letters, an exchange in which the subject is
first person and the object is second person takes place in one and the same location.

elided.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",47.60899353027344,0,0.7442438853463302,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

",32.37089920043945,0,0.7275363679003382,"In this chapter, I will apply Shibatani’s inclusive methodology to Gã in order to
determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.
",37.542877197265625,0,0.8200914792835549,"321
In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.
(232) òkókɛ̀ shìká=àhã́!mí

“Oko gave me the money.”

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

 “And the boy got up slowly.”",43.26680755615234,0,0.7660622276803596,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

“The baby is very fat.”

(299b) ?tsó=ɛ̀é-kɛ́ɛɛ́ ́kàkàdãŋ́ ŋ́ ́
tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall
“The tree is not very tall.”
2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",46.0917854309082,0,0.7027529478445124,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

Barring special discourse contexts such as phone conversations and letters, an exchange in which the subject is
first person and the object is second person takes place in one and the same location.

elided.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

This discourse-pragmatic use of the recent perfect has been described for English by Nishiyama
and Koenig (2006) and is termed by them as “commonsense entailment”.
3.2.2.4.3 Perfect of persistent situation
In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present
(Comrie 1976:60). This is seen in (105) and (106), for example.
(105) yòómó=!ɛ́é-!fó ãã̀ hṹũ

3SG.PERF=workthing be.located there 3SG.PERF-last.long
“She has worked there for a long time.”
3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.
(363) òkóni ̀̃bà-kɛ̀ɛ ́ ↑
 bò
OkoFOCVENT-tell 2SG.OBJ
“Was it Oko who told you?”
In (364), it is the object, bò, that is in focus.
(364) bòni ̃̀ òkó bà-kɛ̀ɛ ̂
2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.
 (365) fó-mɔ̃̀ni ̀̃ ò=fó-ɔ̀=ɔ̂
cry-NOM FOC 2SG-cry-HAB=DEF
“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,

example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”
́ ̀ ni ̀̃

who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only

In Gã it is relatively easy for the most part to identify a grammatical word. It is the
distinction between affix and clitic that can be particularly tricky, as these form adjacent points
on the continuum. Any root together with its inflectional and/or derivational morphemes
constitutes a grammatical word. The words in (5) are all grammatical words. Their meanings
are readily available to native speakers. The elements that make up these words always occur in
a fixed order e.g. in (a) the pronominal clitic must precede the verb, which also precedes the
future negative.

c)jù-lɔ̀-ì
steal-AG-PL
‘thieves’
d)gbèé ‘dog’
The grammatical words listed above are also phonological words and in addition they constitute
utterances by themselves. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:25) observe that the condition of
isolatability applies to words which are both phonological words and grammatical words.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",37.15576934814453,0,0.8200914792835549," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",51.45854949951172,0,0.7062216974352283,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.

have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",62.605224609375,0,0.7956936696631013,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

" The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

",0,0.73718232377807,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

because of its close relation to the canonical kɛ-SVC construction type. Exactly the diachronic
relation between them is not clear. Based on Stassen’s (2000) observations in his typology of
NP conjunction encoding, one hypothesis as to how these construction types are related is that
the preposition kɛ construction gave rise to the comitative/coordinate construction involving
verb kɛ. This position is untenable for Gã. A brief summation of Stassen’s findings is in order.
Stassen noted that there are two kinds of languages: AND-languages and WITH-languages.
AND-languages have two ways of encoding noun phrase conjunction. They either use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of equal syntactic rank (coordinate strategy) or they use a
strategy in which the two NPs are of unequal syntactic rank i.e. one is subordinate to the other
(comitative strategy). In the coordinate strategy the NPs are often linked by a morpheme - the
coordinator, while with the comitative strategy a comitative morpheme is employed. He notes
that in WITH-languages the comitative strategy often grammaticalizes to produce a coordinate
structure, making such languages more like AND-languages, with the major difference being
that their coordinate and comitative markers are identical. The process in SVO languages,
449
according to Stassen (2000:27), involves the shift of the comitative phrase in sentences like
(94a) into pre-verb position, resulting in a comitative/coordinate structure. He notes that many
languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia have undergone or are undergoing this type of
grammaticalization. This path, however, is untenable for Gã, because it is rarely the case that a
preposition will give rise to a verb. It is far more likely that the construction with the
preposition arose from the SVC by movement of kɛ and its object from before the main verb to
after it.

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular

We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the
second verb is hã́ ‘give’ and its object is the recipient. This is seen in (232) below.

",29.5200138092041,0,0.6898140893907153,"316
If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.
",39.17905426025391,0,0.8363742442005798," Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.
(10a) è=sà á!kɛ́ é=kɛ́ɛ ́bò

 “He has to tell you.”

“Everything that you need to be told, he should tell you.”",41.97062683105469,5,0.8092764420233953,"626
What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).
",45.79253387451172,0,0.7027529478445124," In many languages, especially Indo-European languages, stress is a reliable marker of
phonological words. This is because the placement of stress in such languages is predictable,
always falling on a syllable in a particular position. As is the case in many tone languages of
West Africa, stress does not play a significant role at the word level and is therefore unhelpful
in determining phonological words. For instance, Dakubu (1981:235) finds that in Gã, as in
Yoruba, the domain of semantically based syllable stress is not the word but the pause group
(i.e. the intonation unit).
2.1.3 The grammatical word
A grammatical word is described by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19) as consisting “of a
number of grammatical elements which a) always occur together rather than scattered
throughout the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness), b) occur in a fixed order and c) have a
 42
conventionalized coherence and meaning.” These are considered to be the essential properties
that every grammatical word in every language should possess. Other, less universally-
applicable characteristics exist that could be used as supporting evidence. These are that there
will be only one inflectional affix in a word (in languages which have a single inflectional
system on each word class), there will be pauses between words, words may constitute an
utterance all by themselves (isolatability) and finally, morphological processes which apply to a
word will not apply recursively.
",49.993988037109375,0,0.7107818959670508,"In this chapter, I will apply Shibatani’s inclusive methodology to Gã in order to
determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.
",51.382118225097656,0,0.7095142886386051,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

“The baby is very fat.”

(299b) ?tsó=ɛ̀é-kɛ́ɛɛ́ ́kàkàdãŋ́ ŋ́ ́
tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall
“The tree is not very tall.”
2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as

some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply

",57.06657028198242,0,0.7331714854406576," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",43.804229736328125,3,0.8364219111710239,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

",52.38037872314453,0,0.8557230835742143,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

leave.

complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)
child=DEF NMLZ Okobeat(3SG.OBJ)
“It is the child that Oko beat.”
́ ̀ ni ̀̃
(223) nãmɔ̃òkóyì (lɛ̀)
who NMLZ Oko beat (3SG.OBJ)
“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.
(224a) yòó=ɛ̀ ̀
 mãjémi ̃̀ àtàlé

“It was a dress that the woman sent me.”
",24.76288414001465,0,0.7672935662720783," *“It is smoking that Oko smokes.”
It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.
(275) *fã-ã̀ ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=fã ̀gbɛ̀ ni ̃̀̃̀
i=kɛ̀-yà-táòshìká
 uproot-NOM FOC 1SG=uproot wayand 1SG=take-ITIV-look.formoney
 “It was travelling that I did in order to make money.”
The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in

motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode

 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument

particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be

quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

"A detailed analysis of the semantics of all or most verbs and their inherent complements
will constitute a huge undertaking. This modest analysis of a few ICV meaning clusters is
meant to demonstrate that in Gã, these lexical items are not random combinations of verbs and
nouns. For the most part, they have figurative and metaphorical extensions that can be traced to
their meanings in non-ICV contexts. ICVs with the same components will therefore tend to
 359
have some primitive conceptual concept in common, forming a systematic pattern of meaning
expression within an ICV meaning cluster. Some are quite literal (yè ni!ĩ́ ̃́ [eat thing] ‘eat’, wò
jàlà [put wares] ‘display wares for sale’) while others are more metaphorical (e.g. jè gbɛ̀ [exit
way] ‘do sth. intentionally’, tsí yìsɛ̀ɛ ̀ [push back of head] ‘rush someone to do something’.
Either way, they form a very tight semantic unit. Like all metaphor, the meanings of ICVs are
rooted in human experience, which is culturally determined, and this should be at the forefront
of any endeavor to unpack the semantics of these distinctive verbs.
3.5 Non-prototypical clause types
This sections looks at clause types that do not obey the prototypical SVO word order, as well
as clauses which have non-prototypical predicates.
3.5.1 Copula clauses and verbless clauses
In addition to transitive and intransitive clauses, Gã also has copula clauses and verbless
clauses. Copula clauses are clauses containing a verb, the copula, which lacks rich semantic
content and only serves to relate two NP arguments: the subject and the complement. Dixon
(2010:159) identifies five types of relations that may be predicated by the copula: identity,
attribution, possession, benefaction and location.

ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see

adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is

3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect

set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.
",50.62646865844727,0,0.855839239718642,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀

 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",41.68913650512695,3,0.8348557929110608," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",59.38026428222656,0,0.7609832451759398,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

379
A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

the verb and then fronting it.

The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between
the various interpretations - comitative, causative and coordinative - is quite obvious. Assuming
that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.

corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

In order to express the intended meaning in (231b), a serial verb construction must be used. In
this construction, the first verb is kɛ ‘take’ and its object is the definite theme NP, while the

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì
dress tattered
“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀
̃́/jwɛ̃ŋ̀ -̀ mɔ̃̀
 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó
 quiet COPKojo
 “Kojo is quiet.”
7
The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.
",57.979148864746094,0,0.829771750050319,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall
“The tree is not very tall.”
2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,

example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.

(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular

3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are

example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the Gã verb, its associated morphology as well as the simple clause and its
argument structure were introduced. It was noted that there were three types of verbal
predicates in Gã: simple verbs, serial verbs and inherent complement verbs (ICVs) (§3.1).
Verbal categories expressed morphologically were examined. It was determined that Gã was
mainly an aspectual language. The future is the only category resembling tense in Gã, but it
also has modal functions (§3.2.1.2). Most unmarked verbs are given a default past time
interpretation, but depending on the semantics of the verb and the effect of time adverbials,
present time and habitual aspectual interpretations may also be given for bare verbs. In §3.2.2,
the prospective, habitual, progressive, perfect, iterative and distributive aspects were discussed.
An examination of mood revealed that Gã has two irrealis categories, the subjunctive and
imperative, which both signal hypothetical situations (§3.2.3). The various forms of negation
were the subject of §3.2.4. In §3.2.5, the pre-verbal deictic auxiliaries were examined and
shown to provide spatial, aspectual as well as temporal information about the event.
Transitivity and grammatical relations were looked at in §3.3. Gã has nominative-accusative
grammatical relations and evidence was provided in support of the notion of subject. Different
transitivity classes of verbs were identified (§3.3.3). In §3.4, inherent complement verbs (ICVs)
were investigated and it was proven that the complement in an ICV is also the direct object of
386
the verb in the ICV (§3.4). The semantics of ICVs were treated by examining a few meaning
clusters in detail (§3.4.3). Non-prototypical clause types were looked at in §3.5. Copula clauses
and verbless clauses were presented in §3.5.1 and §3.5.2, while the use of verb and preposition
yɛ̀ for location, existential expression and possession was the subject of §3.5.3. Question-
formation was the topic of §3.6. Polar questions are formed by a combination of question
particles and pitch changes on the final syllable of the supposition. Content questions make use
of a focus structure in which the question word is focused. The question word may also be in
situ.

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.
In (308) to (311), the (a) examples contain property concepts modifying nouns while the
corresponding (b) examples contain those same property concepts but modifying verbs (manner
adverbs).

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

",51.55563354492188,0,0.8651643317073925,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀

 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

It is also not possible to focus the verb in the ICV. Verb-focusing is done by first nominalizing
the verb and then fronting it.

The fact that the second translation in (274a) is not possible speaks to the semantic unity of the
verb and its inherent complement. As one semantic unit, its meaning is not restricted to the
meaning of just one of its parts. It predicates an event and thus, like any verb, it is the event
that is being emphasized and contrasted even when only the nominal part of the ICV is in focus
position.
iii) Modification by a verb-based grammatical argument nominalization
Like a canonical direct object, the complement in an ICV can be modified by a verb-based
grammatical argument nominalization. In (276), the ICV is fò shi ̃̀ [cut down] ‘wander’ .

If the verb in the purpose nominalization has two objects, as in (221c), only the object closest
to the verb i.e. the recipient, can be raised to become the object of the main verb (221d). The
theme cannot (221e). This shows that it is the recipient that is the direct object.

 “Oko is looking for a necklace to gift to Aku/Oko wants a necklace to gift to Aku.”
iv) Focalization and constituent questioning
These two are discussed together because they essentially comprise the same syntactic strategy.
An argument is focused by placing it in sentence-initial position followed by the focus marker,
ni.̃̀ The focus marker may be omitted, although its tone remains and docks on the preceding
syllable (See chapter 7 for a fuller discussion). A content question is obtained by placing the
317
question word in initial position followed by the focus marker, ni.̃̀ Here also, the focus marker
may be deleted.
In (222), the patient/object in a monotransitive clause is focused and in (223) it is questioned.
́
(222) gbé!kɛ̃=!ɛ̃ ́ ni ̃̀òkóyì(lɛ̀)

“It is the child that Oko beat.”

“Who did Oko beat?”
The focalization and question-formation tests yield some mixed results. Since a direct object in
a monotransitive clause is capable of being focused and questioned, one would expect that a
direct object in a ditransitive clause will also be amenable to these processes. For most
speakers, both the theme and recipient arguments of all ditransitive verbs do qualify in this
regard. The example in (224a) contains the verb, mãj̀ é ‘send.from.abroad’.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

(364) bòni ̃̀ òkó bà-kɛ̀ɛ ̂
2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm

‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",50.87128829956055,3,0.7825808671289907,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

determine how major voice categories are realized in this language. In §5.1, the well-known
active/passive voice opposition will be examined. §5.2 takes a look at the causative voice, §5.3
looks at middles, and §5.4 at antipassives. Benefactives and applicatives have their turn in §5.5
and the chapter is summarized in §5.6.

"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

This discourse-pragmatic use of the recent perfect has been described for English by Nishiyama
and Koenig (2006) and is termed by them as “commonsense entailment”.
3.2.2.4.3 Perfect of persistent situation
In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present
(Comrie 1976:60). This is seen in (105) and (106), for example.

“She has worked there for a long time.”
3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì

“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀

 Aku have money/sibling/strength/think-NOM
 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).
(255) *diŋ́́̃ ŋ̀ jí Kòjó

 “Kojo is quiet.”

b) Aspectual function
A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.
i) Completive aspect
In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-
final slot in an SVC (28), (29).

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

",50.64472961425781,0,0.7946777727017991,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",46.16960525512695,0,0.7614199239849972," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

This indicates that yàá- has not proceeded as far down the grammaticalization cline as bàá-,

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.

(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́

“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16

leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present

3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

In such SVCs which have kɛ as V1 and a motion verb as V2, the semantic relationship between

that kɛ did originally mean ‘take’, it is a logical implication that if a person, A takes an object
X and moves while still in possession of X, then A is accompanied by X for as long as A is in
possession of X, making a comitative interpretation possible. If X is inanimate, or is animate
but subject to A’s control and manipulation, then it is A who causes or makes X move, hence
the causative sense. When X is animate but is not subject to A’s control or manipulation, X
 444
may on their own volition move in the company of A. The result is that A and X are now both
involved in the same activity at the same time and kɛ is reanalysed as a coordinator.

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They

A few aspectual meanings are conveyed by minor verbs in asymmetrical SVCs.

In order to express completive aspect, the verb tã̀ ‘be finished, be used up’ occurs in the verb-

Chapter 2: Words and word classes
2.0 Introduction
This chapter examines the concept of the word in Gã. It categorises these words into various
functional categories known as word classes and examines any accompanying morphology.
§2.1 will focus on wordhood and the delineation of phonological and grammatical words. §2.2
will give an overview of some of the difficulties encountered in divying up the lexicon of a
language into syntactic/semantic categories such that they can be relevant to discussions of
typology and linguistic theory. The following word classes will then be discussed in detail:
nouns in §2.3, property concepts in §2.4 and adverbs in §2.5. Ideophones, which do not
constitute a separate word class, will be looked at in §2.6, and finally, interjections will be the
subject of §2.7. The entirety of chapter 3 will be devoted to verbs.
2.1 Wordhood
The concept of a word is one that linguists as well as non-linguists alike take for granted. It is
assumed to be self-evident and easily identifiable, especially when examining a language in its
written form. However, as many writers such as Matthews (1991) and Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2002) have noted, several linguists have tried unsuccessfully to define “word” in a way that is
applicable to all languages. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to reach a consensus is
38
that each writer utilizes different sets of criteria in arriving at their conclusion, with many
appealing to both phonological and grammatical attributes in identifying a word. This,
according to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:10) leads to ambiguities and conflicts when these
criteria do not coincide. Some writers even appeal to orthographic conventions when
delineating the word. For example, Pike’s (1947:89) definition of the word as the smallest unit
of meaning capable of being written in between spaces. This approach also runs into problems
because different orthographic conventions may be used for the same language or closely
related languages. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) advocate an approach that keeps grammatical
and phonological criteria separate and attempts to define the word in terms of each of these
phenomena. In what follows I try to do that and subsequently compare the results from the
utilization of these two rubrics to see whether and how they coincide.
2.1.2 The phonological word
Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:13) define a phonological word as “a phonological unit larger
than a syllable (in some languages it may minimally be one syllable) which has at least one
(and generally more than one) phonologically defining property.” These defining properties
belong to three broad phonological categories, namely: segmental features, prosodic features
and phonological rules. Below, I discuss the phonological features that define the phonological
word in Gã. These features are few and I have identified just two from two areas: segmental
39
features and prosodic features. Note that none of these features individually constitute both a
necessary and sufficient condition for phonological word. However, the aggregate of these
provide good evidence for it.
2.1.2.1 Segmental features
Segmental features comprise phonological features related to internal syllabic and segmental
structure and related phonetic features, word boundary phenomena and pause phenomena
(Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:13). In Gã, there are certain vowel sequences that cannot occur
within a phonological word. However some of these sequences are permitted across word
boundaries. Therefore the occurrence of such vowel sequences suggests the presence of a
phonological word boundary. These vowel sequences are ɛe, ɔe, ɛa, oe, ɔa and ae. For example,
in (1), the sequence of the phonemes /ɛ/ in kɛ́ ‘when’ and /a/ in àwò ‘they prepare’ can only
occur across word boundaries as it is prohibited word-internally. Therefore it is a good marker
of the existence of a phonological word boundary.

This discourse-pragmatic use of the recent perfect has been described for English by Nishiyama
and Koenig (2006) and is termed by them as “commonsense entailment”.
3.2.2.4.3 Perfect of persistent situation
In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present
(Comrie 1976:60). This is seen in (105) and (106), for example.

“She has worked there for a long time.”
3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent

for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode

them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause

cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598

the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,

of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its

leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in

observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

3.3.2.1 Identifying the direct and indirect object in a ditransitive clause
A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

As has been shown in this section, the verbs in a serial verb construction form a very tight
syntactic unit because they cannot be independently marked for contrasting grammatical
categories. Another unique feature of the verbs in SVCs in most languages (Gã being no
different) is that they have just one syntactic subject and in some cases, a shared object as well.
This is further proof that SVCs comprise just one clause. The following section will describe
argument-sharing, generally.
4.2.2 Argument-sharing
4.2.2.1 Subject
In all Gã SVCs the syntactic subject of the initial verb is the syntactic subject of subsequent
verbs. In some SVCs a pronominal copy of the subject appears on all non-initial verbs (13),
(14). Dakubu (2004:16) calls this resumptive serialization.

accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.
(162) kpãã̀ =ã
́ ̀ŋ̀-bàé=bá-tsé
rope=DEF PROG-come 3SG.SBJV=come-break
“The rope is about to break.”
Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.
(163) ni ̃̀ wɔ̀=kɛ̀-bàá-tsɔ̃ɔ̃́ ́ àtàá nãã̀ ́ ̀

 é=jɔ́ɔ ́ bàà nɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ nɔ̃̀
 3SG.SBJV=bless leafthistop
 “We will show it to God, so that he blesses these herbs.” [YM:78]
Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

",55.64509201049805,0,0.8755636201938989,"With little historical data on Gã, it is difficult to unequivocally ascertain what the path
of grammaticalization is and the order in which these senses (including the instrumental sense)
appeared. Based on the semantics of kɛ, it can be assumed that originally, objects of kɛ had to
be inanimate entities; things that could be picked up by hand in order to be transferred to
another location or to be used to achieve some goal. This original construction will thus have
featured instruments and inanimate patients as objects of kɛ. With further grammaticalization,
inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.
For example, yí!tsó ‘head’ (103) and shi!ã̃́ ́ ‘house’ (104) respectively. In (103) we see vestiges
of the instrumental role of the object of kɛ, in that yí!tsó ‘head’ is the entity that was utilized to
bring about the action of pushing the patient, ‘3SG.OBJ’. Stolz et al (2006:42) would term
yí!tsó ‘head’, a body part instrument.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West

The above examples belong to the adverb word class alone. However there are many manner
adverbs which also function as adjectives and property nouns. This is not unexpected since they
are all property concepts. Some adjectives and property nouns are used as adverbs without any
overt derivational morphology. Others have to be reduplicated in order to be used as adverbs.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì

“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀

 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",49.66870880126953,0,0.8029957120337057," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",43.36650848388672,0,0.7614199239849972,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

ii) Focalization
The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an
ICV is focused, the semantic interpretation is one of event focus, not argument focus as
expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is
focused, to (274b) where the object of an ordinary verb (shɛ́lé ‘smoke’) is focused.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.

The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.
 (365) fó-mɔ̃̀ni ̀̃ ò=fó-ɔ̀=ɔ̂

“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

",44.12094879150391,0,0.7448453474417025,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

This indicates that yàá- has not proceeded as far down the grammaticalization cline as bàá-,
which can co-occur with both deictic verbs. yàá- retains enough of its spatial semantic meaning
 234
to render co-occurrence with yà ‘go’ unnecessary and co-occurrence with bà ‘come’ a
contradiction, hence their ungrammaticality.

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for

inanimate objects which could not literally be ‘taken’ were permitted to serve as objects of kɛ.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",3,0.8043523770077206,"626
What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.
",35.91477966308594,0,0.8448457226565855," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.

This discourse-pragmatic use of the recent perfect has been described for English by Nishiyama
and Koenig (2006) and is termed by them as “commonsense entailment”.
3.2.2.4.3 Perfect of persistent situation
In this use the perfect denotes situations that start in the past and still persist into the present
(Comrie 1976:60). This is seen in (105) and (106), for example.

3.2.2.4.4 Narrative perfect
In Gã, there is a special use of the perfect optionally employed for the narration of a sequential
set of events. This set of events comprises a temporally ordered series of activities that are
presented as formulaic, fixed and methodical. Discourse genres where this perfect is abundant
include procedural narratives, where a speaker describes the methods or steps involved in
accomplishing some activity. Descriptions of everyday routines also make good candidates for
perfect marking, as well as any set of events that is felt to be sequentially-ordered.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:
(252) mɔ̃!́ nyɔ̃́ ‘smash, mangle’mɔ̃ń yɔ̃ḿ ɔ̃ń yɔ̃́ ‘tattered’

2SG=dress=DEF PERF-tear-ITER
“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì

“a tattered dress”
146
2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.
(254a) ákú yɛ̀shìká/nyɛ̃m̀ i/hèwàlɛ̀

 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

This indicates that yàá- has not proceeded as far down the grammaticalization cline as bàá-,
which can co-occur with both deictic verbs. yàá- retains enough of its spatial semantic meaning
 234
to render co-occurrence with yà ‘go’ unnecessary and co-occurrence with bà ‘come’ a
contradiction, hence their ungrammaticality.
",28.930532455444336,0,0.7701686193797808," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an

expected. Compare the meaning of (274a) where the complement in an ICV (fã̀ gbɛ̀ ‘travel’) is

2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive

What allows such argument nominalizations to be used in focus constructions as well as
relative constructions is the fact that they contain presuppositions about the involvement of
some entity in an activity. The activity is presupposed and so naturally, the identity of the
entities partaking in the activity will be sought. The function of focus constructions is to supply
this missing information. In (220), it is presupposed in the argument nominalization that some
money was stolen and the identity of the thief is supplied by the focused argument. As was
shown in §3.6.2, content questions also make use of focus structures and hence grammatical
nominalizations. In questions, the identity of the referent which has crucial relevance in the
event presupposed in the grammatical nominalization is not known, and is being explicitly
sought. This is done by putting a question word in subject position. In relative constructions,
the presupposition in the grammatical nominalization is meant to aid the addressee to identify
the referent of the head nominal. So again, in (221), there is a presupposition that some money
was stolen. This information is given information and it is used to delimit the potential pool of
referents of yòó!ɛ́ ‘the woman’ in order to make it more identifiable to the addressee. This is
the modificational function. The new information is contained in the predicate - the fact of the
woman having died. So what makes grammatical argument nominalizations a good vehicle for
the expression of focus (and by extension content questions) and relativization is the
presuppositions contained within them that demand the revelation of any missing actors
 627
involved in the presupposed event. This connection was first reported by Shibatani and bin
Makhashen (2009:23-24).

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

Barring special discourse contexts such as phone conversations and letters, an exchange in which the subject is
first person and the object is second person takes place in one and the same location.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the
part of the subject. This is especially obvious when the subject is inanimate, as in (40a). But
even with animate subjects, in some contexts a motional interpretation is unsuitable (40b).

" Perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the discussion of wordhood in Gã is the
observation that whole sentences such as the verb complex in (8) above must also be
considered phonological words. A strict line between Gã morphology and Gã syntax can then
only be feasibly drawn by separating the study of grammatical words (as opposed to
phonological words) from the study of how these grammatical words combine to form
sentences. Making such a distinction does not seem worthwhile considering that verb
complexes like those in (8) make up the core of most utterances in Gã. Following from this,
there will not be a significant attempt in this dissertation to separate morphological phenomena
from syntactic phenomena. The two are inextricably linked; each can be better understood in
terms of the other and so ultimately it is best that they are examined inter-dependently.
",0,0.8043523770077206," The omission of the focus particle is not feasible in all syntactic environments. One of
these is when the focused constituent ends in a low-tone syllable but the omission of the focus
particle will result in a sentence with neutral pragmatic status i.e. the focus meaning will be
lost. This commonly occurs when such a focused constituent is a full NP, rather than a
pronoun, and the focused NP is also the agent of the clause. The pair of sentences in (14)
illustrates this point. (14a) can only be interpreted as a pragmatically-neutral sentence and not a
639
focused one with an omitted focus marker. Constructions such as (14) where the focused NP
ends in a low tone and that NP is also the agent or executor of the action must obligatorily
feature the focus marker in order to be considered a focus construction.

cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.

In (24), the focus construction conveys not exactly a correction but an observation of a state of
affairs that is contrary to what the hearer perceived. At the beginning of the conversation (a
phone call), Deborah had told Tess to speak only Gã since the conversation would be recorded
for the purposes of analysis of the Gã language. Tess agreed. At some point in the
conversation, however, Deborah switches to English to quote an English proverb. It is in
response to this apparent violation by Deborah of her own rule that prompts Tess to utter the
focus construction in order to point out the irony.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

While the adjective tsùlù ‘red’ can replace the noun étsùlù in line 1, it cannot replace it in line
2 (251). The implication of this is that an object complement denoting result must be a noun.

2.4.2.3 Derivation of adjectives from verbs
Adjectives may be derived from verbs by the following derivational processes.
i) Suffixation
This is not a very productive means of adjectivization. Two basic colour adjective terms are
derived from verbs by the suffixation of -ŋ. These are di!ŋ́̃́ ‘black’ from di ̃́ ‘to become black’
 145
and yɛ̃!́ ŋ́ ‘white’ from yɛ́ ‘to become white’. It is limited to these two words. Another suffix, -
ru/-lu derives the adjective tsùrù/tsùlù from tsù ‘become red’.
ii) Reduplication
Another means of deriving adjectives is by reduplicating certain verbs. The verbs must be
ambitransitive/labile verbs and must belong to the “temporary” property verb class (discussed
in §2.4.1.1). This method is fairly limited in productivity. In (252) and (253), the property verb
is found in the (a) examples while the adjective is in the (b) examples:

“Your dress is torn.”
(b) àtàlé tsɛ́lɛ̀ìtsɛ́lɛ́ì

2.4.3 Type C: Property concepts that function as arguments in clauses (Property
nouns)
Certain descriptive words may occur as subjects or objects of verbs. Most are able to occur as
objects of the verbs yɛ̀7 ‘have’ and fèê ‘do’. Hengeveld (1992:34) calls such linking words
‘semi-copulas’. Such descriptive words are classed as property nouns because they occur in a
syntactic position reserved for nouns (254). In (254a), the objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ are regular
nouns; in (254b) the object of yɛ̀ ‘have’ is a property noun.

 “Aku has money/a sibling/strength/sense”
(254b) yòó=ɛ̀ yɛ̀ légélégé
 woman=DEF have skinny
 “The woman is skinny.”
Property nouns constitute a large class with dozens of members from all semantic classes. They
often describe a stable or permanent attribute. In Gã, the normal copula jí ‘be’ cannot have a
property noun as complement (255).

The verb yɛ̀ is polysemous and may also mean ‘be located’.
",35.854373931884766,0,0.8448457226565855,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.
",28.54892539978028,3,0.7945764171876544,"ICVs are syntactically unique. They contain an obligatory complement which functions
as the direct object to the verb. The complement exhibits a number of syntactic properties that
are typical of objects, but at the same it lacks certain canonical features of direct objecthood
such as pronominalization. The inability to display these features largely stems from the unique
semantics of ICVs, where both components must be overtly present in order for the ICV to
carry out its predicating function. The whole cannot function without a part and that is why
sentences like (280b) sound awkward. In the following section, the semantics of ICVs will be
discussed in greater detail.
3.4.4 Semantics of ICVs
In an ICV, the verb alone cannot code the state, event or activity that is coded by the ICV as a
whole. In (282a) bí gbɛ̀ [ask way] codes the act of asking permission for something, in this
case, permission to leave.
347
(282a) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀ mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask road then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask permission (to leave) then.”16 [FH:150]
Omitting the complement, as in (282b) or replacing it with different arguments in (282c) results
in different meanings, none of them involving permission. Since bí ‘ask’ is a transitive verb,
when it occurs without an overt object, one may assume that its object is the null third singular
inanimate pronoun. So, in (282b) what is being asked is presumably known from previous
discourse. The point of relevance here is that, it does not code the act of asking permission.
(282b) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bî mɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask then
“Auntie Sally, we will ask, then.”
(282c) Auntie Sally wɔ̀=bàá-bí ákûmɔ̃́
Auntie Sally 1PL=FUT-ask Akuthen
“Auntie Sally, we will ask Aku, then.”
We see that it is only when bí ‘ask’ is used with the complement gbɛ̀ ‘way’ that it predicates
the act of seeking permission. This obligatoriness of a specific complement in order to yield a
specific meaning is what makes ICVs unique. The same phenomenon is illustrated in (283), this
time with an ICV that has a relational noun complement - kũ̀ sɛ̀ɛ ̀ [break back] ‘return’. Its
proper use is shown in (283a). In (283b) it is ungrammatical because it is missing its
16
 “wɔ̀=bàá-bí gbɛ̀” is usually said at the end of a visit to indicate that the visit has ended and one is about to
leave.
348
complement and because kũ̀ ‘break’ is an ambitransitive verb, the (animate) subject is
interpreted as the patient of kũ̀ ‘break’, a situation that is absurd. Finally, in (283c), the
meaning of the predicate changes because the complement of kũ̀ ‘break’ changes.

379
A particular constituent in a polar question may be focused by fronting it and following
it with the focus particle, ni.̃̀ The English construction that best reflects the semantics of this
construction would be a cleft construction, as in (363), where the subject, Oko is the referent
whose identity is being questioned.
(363) òkóni ̀̃bà-kɛ̀ɛ ́ ↑
 bò
OkoFOCVENT-tell 2SG.OBJ
“Was it Oko who told you?”
In (364), it is the object, bò, that is in focus.
(364) bòni ̃̀ òkó bà-kɛ̀ɛ ̂
2SG.OBJ FOC Oko VENT-tell
“Was it you that Oko came and told?”
The verb or action may also be focused in a polar question, but this results in a rhetorical
question expressing disbelief that the subject referent is partaking in the action (365). In order
for the verb to be focused it must be nominalized.
 (365) fó-mɔ̃̀ni ̀̃ ò=fó-ɔ̀=ɔ̂
cry-NOM FOC 2SG-cry-HAB=DEF
“Are you really crying?” (Lit: “Is it crying that you are crying?”)
The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone
 380
pattern is not identical to dààbí ‘no’. It is best transcribed as ḿm̀ hm̀ ḿ. An alternative to this is -
ɛ̃ɛ́ h̃̀ ɛ̃ɛ̀ ̃́ - which has the same tone pattern but involves oral articulation rather than just voicing
with the vocal cords.
3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are
nãḿ ɔ̃̀ ‘who’, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ ‘what’, nɛ̃ǵ bɛ̀/niŋmɛ̃̃́ ̀ ‘where’, mɛ́ɛb̀ à/mãá b̃̀ à, mɛ̃ń i ̃̀ hèwɔ̀ [what sake] ‘why’,
mɛ̃ɛ́ b̃̀ è ‘when’, té…tɛ̃ŋ́ ŋ́ ̀ ‘how’, é!nyiɛ̃̃́ ́ ‘how many, how much’, mɛ̃!́ ɛ̃́ NP ‘which NP’. One
example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

 234
to render co-occurrence with yà ‘go’ unnecessary and co-occurrence with bà ‘come’ a
contradiction, hence their ungrammaticality.

The question of where the deictic centre is is a tricky one. It appears to be a conceptual
space or environment in which both the speaker and the subject or agent of the clause are
situated. This space need not coincide with the actual physical space that the speaker and agent
occupy since they may be in two totally different locations (as the case may be if they are
talking on the phone). For example, when the speakers utter the sentences in (35) to (37), they
indicate that the respective subjects/agents will move away from their current locations in order
to carry out their respective actions. My reason for postulating that the speaker and the agent
share the same conceptual space is that yàá- cannot be used when the speaker is predicating an
action that will affect the speaker or addressee (the first person or second person). In other
words, yàá- may not qualify a verb when it is the speaker (38c) or addressee (38a), (38b) that is
the object or patient of the verb. This is true whether the agent is a third person (38a), or the
speaker himself i.e. first person (38b). These sentences are not acceptable because in such
228
pragmatic contexts, the speaker and addressee share the same physical space9 and so it is
ungrammatical for the speaker to use a deictic morpheme which indexes movement away from
that space if indeed the endpoint of the action (the patient) is confined to that same location. If
the deictic centre was just the agent alone or speaker alone, it would be very difficult to explain
the ungrammaticality of (38). In these instances, the future marker bàá- is preferred (39a),
(39b). These examples show that in addition to its future time semantics, yàá- still has traces of
its original motional sense and is not merely a future marker.

There are also contexts in which the use of yàá- expresses no sense of physical motion on the

The fact that purpose constructions with main verb bà ‘come’ or yà ‘go’ are the only
ones capable of doing away with the nominalizer is no accident. The conceptual link between
motion, generally, and purpose is very strong indeed, as reported by Schmidtke-Bode
(2009:97). She observes that in many languages, ‘motion-cum-purpose’ clauses, as she calls
them, contain less morphological material (e.g. no purpose markers, no purpose clause
subjects), suggesting a much tighter semantic bond than in non-motion purpose types. The
 597
reduction in form comes about as a result of high predictability, which is a consequence of the
cognitive link that humans make between movement from one location to another and the
accomplishment of goals. Schmidtke-Bode writes that even from childhood we associate
change of location with a need to get something done at the new location. It is the ubiquity of
this cognitive association that makes purpose markers and purpose subject arguments
redundant; afterall, it is normally the case that the one who moves is the one who has a goal to
achieve by moving. Indeed, there are several languages for which purpose adverbials can only
occur with motion main verbs (Smidtke-Bode 2009:94). In Gã, the ‘motion-cum-purpose’
construction has even grammaticalized to mark prospective aspect. This is limited to the verb,
bà ‘come’ when it is in the progressive.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́
Apart from ni ̃́ and kóni,̃́ purpose nominalizations may also be marked by á!kɛ́. The use of a
quotative marker grammaticalized from the verb ‘say’ as a purpose marker is found in
neighbouring Akan and according to Schmidtke-Bode (2009), is also attested in other unrelated
languages e.g. Kannada and Lezgian. Schmidtke-Bode (2009:192) calls such constructions
verbalized self-suggestions because they probably arose from situations where an actor asserts
 598
an action and verbalizes the intended result as direct speech. The action and result are linked by
the verb ‘say’. Using (163) as an example, this will translate to: “And we will show it to God,
saying “Bless these herbs”.

Purpose adverbials marked by á!kɛ́, unlike those marked by ni,̃́ do not have to have irrealis
marking on the purpose predicate. In (164), the purpose predicate is marked progressive. The
semantics of á!kɛ́-purpose adverbials is nevertheless very similar to the ni-̃́ purpose adverbials.
It denotes an event which is viewed as the desired result or the reason for the action in the main
clause. For example, in (163), the purpose of showing ‘it’ to God is so that he blesses it and in
(164), the subject turns around in order to go/leave.

5.6 Summary
This chapter has surveyed the various voice categories found in Gã with the understanding that
major voice categories are rooted in the human conceptualization of the evolution of an action.
As such, all languages will display these major voice oppositions albeit via different structural
means. It has been shown that voice expressions in Gã often do not involve a change in valency
or a realignment of grammatical relations. In §5.1 it was shown that Gã employs a non-
promotional impersonal passive construction. The semantic and syntactic scope of causatives
was discussed in §5.2. Causatives are expressed by a construction involving the causative verb,
hã́ ‘give’ and a grammatical event nominalization which functions as its object. The middle
voice was the subject of §5.3 and in Gã it is expressed lexically, by intransitive verbs and some
transitive verbs (all ICVs), as well as periphrastically by the PRON+he possessive NP. This
NP is primarily used to mark reflexive middles and reciprocals but may also be employed for
non-reflexive middles. Antipassives were shown in §5.4 to be conveyed by fully transitive
clauses with a generic noun (ni!ĩ́ ̃́ ‘thing’ or mɔ̃̀ ‘person’) in object position. Benefactives and
applicatives were the topic of §5.5.

formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

 Agentive nouns with the suffix, -lɔ and -fo are pluralized with the plural suffix -i.
Example, jùlɔ̀ì ‘thieves’, tsɔ̃ɔ̀ l̃́ ɔ̀ì ‘teachers’, shãm
̀ ɔ̃l̀ ɔ̀ì ‘those who urinate/idiots’ and òhiã̃̀ !́ fó!í
‘poor people’. Words nominalized by tsɛ̀ are pluralized with -mɛ̃ì ,̃̀ which itself is the plural of
mɔ̃̀ ‘person’. Example: àkùtútsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘orange sellers’, shìkátsɛ̀mɛ̃ì ̃̀ ‘rich people’.
6.1.3 Nominalization of simple verb phrases and inherent complement verbs
(ICVs)
In Gã, it is possible to nominalize any simple verb phrase consisting of a verb and its object by
switching the order of the verb and object and nominalizing the verb. That is, the object is
fronted or preposed and the nominalized verb immediately follows it. This nominalization may
then be used as an argument in a clause. Most of such nominalizations result in phrases and not
necessarily lexical items. For example, the sentence in (10a) contains the verb phrase kɛ́ɛ ́ bò
‘tell you’. It is provided in order to show the contrast between it and the nominalization, bò
kɛ̀ɛ!́ mɔ̃́ ‘telling you’ in (10b). In (10a) the verb precedes the object; in (10b) it is nominalized
and it now follows the object. The entire nominalization in (10b) also functions as an argument
- the object of sà ‘fit’.

 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview, scope and aims of the study
The aim of this dissertation is to provide a thorough description and analysis of a wide range of
morphological and syntactic phenomena in the Gã language. Gã is a language of the Niger-
Congo family, the largest language phylum in the world with 1,436 languages (Williamson and
Blench 2000:11). It belongs to the Kwa sub-branch, which is the predominant branch in West
Africa. Gã is spoken primarily in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. Native speakers are also
referred to as Gã (people) or Gãs.

communicating various crucial meanings will encourage more ambitious studies of these little
words in this and other languages.
2.8 Summary
This chapter has seen the presentation and discussion of the phonological word (§2.1.2) and the
grammatical word (§2.1.3) in Gã. It has been shown that in many instances they are one and
201
the same (§2.1.8). The various word classes and their accompanying morphology have also
been discussed. Nouns, the grammatical categories associated with them, as well as pronouns
and possession were presented in §2.3. Property concepts were the subject of §2.4. Gã was
shown to have three main grammatical types of property concepts: those that manifest as verbs
(§2.4.1), those that manifest as adjectives (§2.4.2) and those that manifest as nouns (§2.4.3).
Grammatical differences between property verbs and non-property verbs were also noted
(§2.4.1.3 and §2.4.1.4). The same was done with property nouns and regular nouns (§2.4.3.1
and §2.4.3.2). The various semantic types of adverbs pertinent to Gã were discussed in §2.5.
Finally, in §2.6 ideophones were recognized as a phonosemantic class of words with
membership in the property noun and adverb classes. Their unique phonological and morpho-
syntactic characteristics were discussed. Finally, interjections, were covered in §2.7.
",35.738189697265625,0,0.8448457226565855,"Some writers such as Haspelmath (2011) decry linguists’ obsession with finding a
cross-linguistic definition of the word, specifically the morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical)
word. He believes that such a concept has no validity across languages and consequently that
the division between morphology and syntax is spurious. Defining the word for specific
languages is a much easier enterprise, but even so different writers give different weight to
different properties with the result that each writer simply chooses whichever word criteria that
his language of study exhibits as proof of wordhood (Haspelmath 2011:59). He advocates an
approach that recognizes the concept of a fuzzy word or prototypical word, where grammatical
units occupy a continuum from tightly bound entity to independent word (i.e. from affix
through clitic to independent word). The same view is taken by Aikhenvald (2002:43) and
others.
",38.20410537719727,0,0.8157732731200671,"The semantics of possessive predication would require that the complement of yɛ̀ ‘have’
be a noun. Only concrete ‘things’ can be possessed. An extension to allow property-denoting
words to fill this slot is not unexpected. If a thing or person exhibits some quality, then that
quality can be thought of as being a part of the thing’s or person’s constitution - a part of their
‘body’ (to use the term loosely), which they then have control over (just as humans have
control over their bodies) and can be said to have ownership over.
2.4.3.9 Adverbial use of property nouns
Property nouns can themselves be used for the adverbial modification of property verbs which
have identical semantic component (298), (299). This is possible only in the affirmative, as the
(b) examples show. The function of the property noun appears to be emphasis; it reinforces the
property expressed by the property verb.

tree=DEFPERF-be.tall.NEGtall
“The tree is not very tall.”
2.4.4 Comparison and Gradability
One of the most common features of property words across languages is that they can occur as
a parameter of comparison in comparative constructions. In Gã, only property verbs and
property nouns can occur in comparative constructions. The comparative construction is a serial
verb construction in which the property word constitutes the first VP or is a complement of the
first VP and the comparative verb, fè ‘surpass’ constitutes the second VP. The object of fe
‘surpass’ is the object of comparison. Since the comparative construction only has positions for
nouns (objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’ or fèê ‘surpass’) and verbs (V1 slot), adjectives cannot occur in this
construction since they cannot be objects of yɛ̀ ‘have’. However, since many adjectives in Gã
have verbal counterparts, this does not represent a handicap for concepts expressed by
adjectives; their verbal semantic counterparts can occur in comparative constructions. Example
(300) contains a property verb as parameter of comparison while (301) and (302) have property
nouns. (303a) is a comparative sentence where the property at issue is an adjective, tsùlù ‘red’.

A decades-old problem in syntax is that of ascertaining which object in a ditransitive
construction is the direct object i.e. which object exhibits the same syntactic behavior as the
single object in a transitive clause. The other object, by virtue of not exhibiting these
characteristics nor characteristics of the subject, is then ascribed the status of indirect object. In
order to answer this question with respect to Gã, one must recognize that various objects will
display various syntactic properties depending on the verb they occur with. Therefore, not all
direct objects in ditransitive clauses are the same. Some exhibit more typical direct object
features than others.

The answer to a polar question may be minimally, hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃/́ ɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, dààbí ‘no’or an
answer that communicates ignorance. Agreement may also be indicated by a vocative which
involves simply vibrating the vocal cords to the tonal pattern of hɛ̃ɛ̀ !̃́ ɛ̃́ ‘yes’, a sound I
transcribe as m̀ ḿ!ḿ. Disagreement may also be expressed by a vocative, one whose tone

3.6.2 Content questions
The means of formation of content questions is similar to the focused polar questions just
discussed. A content question is basically a focus construction which has a question word in
focus. Watters (2000:215) notes that in many African languages question words are always
focused constituents. The focus particle, ni ̃̀ may optionally occur after the question word. In all
the examples in my data, the focus particle was absent. The question words found in Gã are

example featuring each question word is given below. A focus particle is included in brackets
in examples where its presence is feasible. The norm, it seems, is to leave it out. There are no
special pitch changes associated with content questions, in the manner that was seen with polar
questions.

The complement in the ICV can be focused just like a direct object can. There is one major
difference, however. As noted by Aboh and Essegbey (2010:59), when the complement in an

 The syntactic phenomena discussed above shows that Gã treats A and S arguments the
same and O arguments differently. This is equivalent to what pertains in languages like English
that have established subject and object grammatical relations. Therefore, one can posit that the
arguments that occur in A and S function in Gã are subjects, while those that occur in P
function are objects.
3.3.2 Ditransitive clauses
In the preceding sections, we have seen examples of clauses which have no object (intransitive
clauses) and those which have one object (monotransitive clauses). Certain verbs are capable of
occurring with two objects, resulting in ditransitive clauses/constructions. Examples of such
verbs are hã́ ‘give’, kè ‘gift (v.)’, wò ‘wear, apply’, mã̀ ‘lend’, fà ‘borrow’, ŋmã̀ ‘write (a
letter)’. Some example sentences are given below, with the two objects in bold:

that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",31.29376983642578,0,0.8946745814945926," Other authors have noted that the adjective class (or more broadly, the class of words
that occur as modifiers of nouns in NPs) in many West African languages is an innovation
(Ameka 1991b). Schaefer and Egbokhare (1993:74) note that in Emai, the relatively new
adjective class is an addition to a system where property concepts were primarily and perhaps
160
singularly coded by verbs. In Gã, it is not possible to determine whether the older form of
property expression is property verbs or attributive adjectives and nouns. What does seem
clear, though, is that complementation of yɛ̀ ‘have’ with property nouns is a more recent
innovation, judging from the fact that most of the basic property concepts cannot occur in this
construction.
2.4.3.8 The relationship between possession and property-denotation
The use of possessive syntax to introduce property concepts is common in the world’s
languages. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2013:536) observe that property concept lexemes
which occur in possessive predicate constructions are those that denote abstract “substances”
such as English ‘strength’ and ‘beauty’. These are essentially abstract nouns. Those that occur
in canonical predicate constructions (e.g. copula constructions) tend to be adjectives in English.
Their thesis is that substance-denoting property concepts require possessive semantics in order
to meet the truth conditions of property concept constructions, while adjectivally-denoting
property concepts have no such requirement.
",41.616966247558594,0,0.8449483614669124,"Another characteristic of SVCs – that each component be able to stand on its own – or
that each verb should be able to occur as the only verb in a simple clause, is also called into
question by Shibatani (2009a). He shows that in an SVC, only one of the verbs is fully
formally and functionally finite, while the other verbs are dependent on it. In order for these
 392
non-finite verbs to occur independently they must be morphologically marked as such, and in
this instance they are different from their SVC forms. This means that constructions which
contain converbs can be considered SVCs. Converbs, common in Chinese, can only occur in
the company of another verb and this fact has led Matthews (2006) and others to disqualify
such converbal constructions as SVCs. This point is especially pertinent to Gã, where over a
third of all SVCs contain a converb-like element, kɛ.
",47.62492370605469,0,0.8817062642267008,"The template in table 8 shows verbal morphemes and the order in which they appear in
the verb word. There are three pre-head slots and two post-head slots. If a slot can be occupied
by more than one TAMP category, then these categories are mutually exclusive for the slot in
question. Also, slot 3, containing the negative subjunctive prefix ká- may occur only in the
presence of the subjunctive prefix á- in slot 2. There are two deictic pre-verbs: ba- is the
ventive (VENT) pre-verb and generally indicates motion towards the deictic centre while ya- is
the itive (ITIV) pre-verb and indicates motion away from the deictic centre. However, see
§3.2.5 for a discussion of how these auxiliaries in some contexts have lost the semantic
component of motion.
