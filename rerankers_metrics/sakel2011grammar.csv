Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

clause. They exclusively appear with 1st and 2nd person:253

order can easily be varied, with different pragmatic effects.

morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

The basic constituent order in transitive clauses changes when an
argument is represented as a personal pronoun. Primarily subject
participants are represented as personal pronouns, whereas personal
pronouns in object position are extremely rare. Therefore, I will
consider only two types of clauses with personal pronouns here: 1. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP object and 2. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a pro-dropped object.

seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

The basic constituent order in transitive clauses changes when an
argument is represented as a personal pronoun. Primarily subject
participants are represented as personal pronouns, whereas personal
pronouns in object position are extremely rare. Therefore, I will
consider only two types of clauses with personal pronouns here: 1. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP object and 2. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a pro-dropped object.

Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

12.1.3. Word order in transitive clauses
In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).
",42.123085021972656,1,0.642517176006515," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.
",55.33079528808594,1,0.642517176006515,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260

disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.

Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.

The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.

These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).

The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

(12:17) M e’-ki-ki j a e ’ma m i’ mis-e-’.
so-CO-RD DM3M.SG talk-VI-3F.O
‘So (change in referent) he talked to her.’ STE/EC
Apart from appearing independently in the clause, personal pronouns
can also be cliticized to the verb (see also section 5.1.). Primarily 1st and
2nd person pronouns in subject position appear as clitics:
(12:18) Khin ’-ra ’ kaw-e- ’-mi!
now-IR see-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Now you will see!’ WTE/JH
3rd person pronouns usually only appear as clitics in constructions with
the quotative verb yi- ‘say’:
(12:19) ... ye-’-md ’ yij
 say-3F.O-3F.SG footprint
‘...she said to (the) footprint.’ STE/EC
As opposed to independent personal pronouns in transitive clauses,
these clitics can, in very few cases, also cover object functions in the
clause. They exclusively appear with 1st and 2nd person:253
(12:20) “I-ya’-ra ’ mi bae’-i!”yi-n-yae.

question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an

interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260

disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

The basic constituent order in transitive clauses changes when an
argument is represented as a personal pronoun. Primarily subject
participants are represented as personal pronouns, whereas personal
pronouns in object position are extremely rare. Therefore, I will
consider only two types of clauses with personal pronouns here: 1. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP object and 2. a
personal pronoun in subject position and a pro-dropped object.

orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,

caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:

seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

",5,0.9084315859943712,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

",62.72922897338867,2,0.7803001876484656," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",62.64847946166992,3,0.8952809414106327,"3F.SG housebig
‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.
 moming-VJ-F.S good-QT-2SG Ricardina momingVJ-F.S
‘Good morning Ricardina, how are you, good morning!’
COE/JH
(12:27) Nai-jo ’ jaem ’-yae.
moming-VJ-F.S good-lSG

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.

a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in

morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

Apart from appearing independently in the clause, personal pronouns
can also be cliticized to the verb (see also section 5.1.). Primarily 1st and

subject usually precedes the verb:

restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L

the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:

 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we

differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by

",69.09422302246094,1,0.7612021953869295,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:

“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.

In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:

participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.

‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.

See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",50.18875503540039,2,0.7604662702964349," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the

These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",62.19190216064453,1,0.7537125422739488," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",60.89471435546875,3,0.8741962135768487,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by

Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

participants are often realized as personal pronouns and can also occur
in subject position. In this case, the pronoun disambiguates which
identified participant the speaker is talking about.252 In clauses with a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP in object position,
word order is (as a tendency) generally V A O, instead of A V O:

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",45.092323303222656,1,0.6002398231300186," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",47.45283126831055,3,0.9006074551777362,"1SG house-COM

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",51.78150939941406,1,0.8704371044546569," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",58.045188903808594,1,0.871208631685322,"3F.SG housebig
‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.

380 Clause types
12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",53.98844528198242,1,0.8509013152520062,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN
‘First, she was sitting for a while in the shadow.’ STE/EC

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:
(11:99) K atyi’ jike mintyV-chhom khin-ki ajitsiki

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).

At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",39.81672668457031,3,0.8209161198167215," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he

where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning

order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning

the head tata ‘father, priest’:

Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.
",40.78446578979492,4,0.7493543339164377," When several participants are identified in the context, subject
participants are often realized as personal pronouns and can also occur
in subject position. In this case, the pronoun disambiguates which
identified participant the speaker is talking about.252 In clauses with a
personal pronoun in subject position and a full NP in object position,
word order is (as a tendency) generally V A O, instead of A V O:

Apart form a change in the word order with pronominal subjects, there
are also other constituent orders in transitive verbal clauses. These are
378 Clause types
primarily caused by changes in pragmatic status. All kinds of word
orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the
speaker expresses ‘I have not seen them - only these two rats have I
seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an

a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260

interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).
",1,0.8201689799499858,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",39.80900192260742,2,0.8156928615712495,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,

‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto

‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.

252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can

those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.

",64.87242126464844,2,0.8576710557669698," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0

moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",57.64923095703125,4,0.8913444798653223," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",53.21497344970703,3,0.8611448708521047," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",46.49902725219727,3,0.7898858451666366,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:

so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.
",52.1559944152832,4,0.8349399579874491,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

",52.999324798583984,1,0.8382747073917304,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.
",54.78338623046875,5,0.8046740088754063," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:

In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:

‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT

‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?

‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers

naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:

‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247

 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).

eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH

‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the

marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",49.536399841308594,3,0.794976196048872,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.
",59.20201110839844,5,0.8332866570043744," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’

12.1.2. Word order in intransitive clauses
In the present section on intransitive clauses, I will exclusively consider
those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.

morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",64.60275268554688,3,0.853852977166665," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",64.30450439453125,3,0.8622178260426882," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.

Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",46.77212905883789,1,0.8447570823288386,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,

woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

‘man’:

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",60.712284088134766,4,0.8435052283019517,"NG think(PR) -2SG thingyear
 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.
talk-VY-2SG/l.SG now
 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",65.81829833984375,1,0.7466656745120931," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",68.01129913330078,4,0.7818210649236604,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:
(13:54) M e’-ki ja e ’ma menbae’-e-dye’ aj-win m o’-tyaka ’
so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.
",71.7642822265625,4,0.7948540926566167,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:

",71.98431396484375,4,0.8248335708113239
" The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

12.1.2. Word order in intransitive clauses
In the present section on intransitive clauses, I will exclusively consider
those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.
",49.48545837402344,1,0.7810078989489538,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",61.44211959838867,2,0.7854954219986496,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.
",59.142555236816406,5,0.8677282989142415," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?

‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

12.1.2. Word order in intransitive clauses
In the present section on intransitive clauses, I will exclusively consider
those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.
",64.2208251953125,1,0.8462149451961234,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:
Verbal clauses 375

The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.
 moming-VJ-F.S good-QT-2SG Ricardina momingVJ-F.S

380 Clause types
12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning

these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:

seen’, fronting ‘two rats’ due to pragmatic reasons:

 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we

",59.8668212890625,4,0.8219162779113536," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:

derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",67.88021087646484,1,0.7682508131414245,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:

thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391

The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the

where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?

12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses

into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in

",71.67190551757812,1,0.7808894901366382," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is

Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain

noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).

predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

",34.42557907104492,1,0.7134641624789497,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

In the present section on intransitive clauses, I will exclusively consider
those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",52.97719955444336,1,0.8723829095788921,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?

je-k-e ’tshij-dye-si ’?
 take-DK-3F.O fire-B-L.F
 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",41.062347412109375,1,0.7773959069948497," NX-VI.M. S-still-1SG
‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:
(11:91) Khaki majmi jam-bVanik ja em ’-nae’-ban-’-in.
 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN
‘First, she was sitting for a while in the shadow.’ STE/EC

dyij-yi-chhom-ra ’-yae.
think-VY-first-IR-ISG
‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:
(11:99) K atyi’ jike mintyV-chhom khin-ki ajitsiki
EH PS man-firstnow-CO yet jaguar
bae ’-i.
live-VI.M.S
‘It is said that he was a man at first, but now he lives as (i.e. is)
a jaguar.’ ELE/JH
 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.

 jady-i-kiEdy.
go.and.come.back-VI-DK.M.S Edy
‘No, he did not send him, but Edy went there.’ COE/MW
 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

‘She robbed a child in the old days, right?’ COE/JH
 (l2-M )aJibi’-dyaj.
sure-QY
‘Yes, that is right.’ COE/VJ
 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",51.80742263793945,3,0.8374735136022162," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man

372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).

this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when

katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",54.16624069213867,4,0.8291807026353242," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",59.44262313842773,3,0.8350426895051474," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",59.95675277709961,4,0.8567877045339576," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative

‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",59.95978546142578,4,0.8507549141277667,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",67.6601333618164,3,0.7824160860970166," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:

‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning

Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The

relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:

verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",45.09681701660156,1,0.6757461275761834," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

",56.3074951171875,2,0.8821674828538033,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:
(8:15) Jedye-dye-si’-dye’-ki-ra’ ka-ti-’?

 beat-AN-lPI.S.M.O-IR EM-MO kill-VI-lPI.S.M.O
 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:
(8:17) J o ’dye’y d ’ jam ajtsin dyai-dye’-ra’ tsin
 and NG yet IP many-NO-IR IP
j a e ’ma ti-kse-ja’y i- ’-tsa’dyij-ye-dye’

(8:18) Sob-a-kse-ja ’mi ’-in nanatyi ’-in.
 visit-VI-3P.0-1PI.S 3M-P boy-P
 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.
 call-3P.0-lPI.S-IR NG-IRDE.F dry-VY-F.S chicha
 ‘We will call them, the chicha will not stop (lit. ‘dry in’).’
 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",52.68721008300781,1,0.8654484221735881," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’
3F.SG-FO-CO one-F frog 3F-ADwait-VI-AN-F.S
 yo-dye’-si’-tom-ra’ phi-ki.
",40.834590911865234,3,0.7908521877560474,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:

",46.176551818847656,1,0.7999838898413951," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which

combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we

live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F

are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,

astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).

276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",2,0.812055921178924," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393

example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",39.25494003295898,3,0.8174489317969745,"The nominal morphology is rather simple, and most nominal
 modification is carried out by clitics. The same is the case with
 adjectives, adverbs and particles. Exceptional in nominal and adjectival
14Introduction
morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.
",48.84988021850586,1,0.765581682423418," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:

say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.

The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:

‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",56.270809173583984,1,0.8753068797575542," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:
(8:281) Tranquilo wen-chhi-yae nitsiwa-wa-i’
quiet.Emove-DC.M.S-lSG NG.Ecold-RD-VI-F.S
se 'w-e-
feel-VI-3F.O
‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",52.395416259765625,0,0.8499120450844903,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",40.82579803466797,1,0.7856308606955416," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:

clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.

are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",59.807735443115234,1,0.8563313775511341,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:

thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391

The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",70.46590423583984,1,0.8115577899175882," NX-VI.M. S-still-1SG
‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:
(11:91) Khaki majmi jam-bVanik ja em ’-nae’-ban-’-in.
 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:

‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN

 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.

"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",1,0.8066453329593896,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.

 modification is carried out by clitics. The same is the case with
 adjectives, adverbs and particles. Exceptional in nominal and adjectival
14Introduction
morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.
",58.43663787841797,1,0.8231799901552306," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20

‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",63.44785690307617,1,0.8395063478883606,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",34.303462982177734,2,0.7464416877884293,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,

The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",38.05196762084961,3,0.7586469440153312," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",41.09360122680664,3,0.6937621072994736,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:

The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to

Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:

NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:

Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",40.785926818847656,4,0.806686225818767,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:
(13:54) M e’-ki ja e ’ma menbae’-e-dye’ aj-win m o’-tyaka ’
so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.

"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

‘He has three daughters and three sons.’ (lit.: ‘His children are
three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often

independent of the place of its antecedent.",58.11394500732422,1,0.8177588144850287,"DE.M-FO fatherNG send-VD.DT-3M.O

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",60.671634674072266,3,0.8121606537226276," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:

no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:

fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:

When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

12.1.3. Word order in transitive clauses
In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).
",62.39150619506836,1,0.8338113060877608,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:
(13:54) M e’-ki ja e ’ma menbae’-e-dye’ aj-win m o’-tyaka ’
so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.
",33.01584243774414,4,0.7674694742552725,"Intransitive clauses consist of intransitive verbs and a subject
participant. As a full noun phrase, the subject can appear before or after
the verb. Both orders occur in Moseten, with a tendency for S V to be
the pragmatically least marked constituent order:
(12:7)Jiris-khan-katyi’ mayedye’ iits____ oitere’ dyij-yi
one-F-IN-EH day DE.M rooster think-VY.M.S
“tyi-tom-ra ’ phi-ki ”.
person-COM-IR run-VK.M.S
‘One day the rooster thought ‘with whom can I run?’ WTE/JH
In some constructions, the constituent order in intransitive clauses can
be V S. This order can occur when a new participant is introduced:
(12:8)Watyeke katyi’ chon’-ye-chhiiiri-tv soni ’
suddenly EHcome.out-VY-DC.M.S one-M man
daer-si ’-tom jeba ’badye ’.
big-L.F-COM saber
‘Suddenly a man came out with a big saber.’ WTE/JH
When summing up what different people do, the verb often appears
before the subject, focusing on the action instead of on the different
participants:250
(12:9)Khosh-wa’-jo-i its'iki.
sleep-VI.PR-PRI-M.S jaguar
‘The jaguar is sleeping.’ STE/RI
 Moving on to intransitive clauses with a pronominal subject, these also
have the basic constituent order S V, in the same way as intransitive
 clauses with subjects realized as full noun phrases:
Verbal clauses 375
(12:10) Jike-katyi’ m o’wa-ti-’.
",44.10404968261719,1,0.7009976009506051," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",37.57867431640625,3,0.7710827546241609," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

 When the answer to a yes/no question is positive, an emphatic or modal
 marker, or a combination of these can be used, such as anik ‘sure’,
ja -ty i’ ‘yes’, ‘well’, tyaka’ ‘sure’, ‘always’, kha-dyera’ ‘thus it might
 be’ and jib i’dyaj ‘that’s for sure’ (see also section 11.2. and 11.3.):

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:
(11:91) Khaki majmi jam-bVanik ja em ’-nae’-ban-’-in.
 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN
‘First, she was sitting for a while in the shadow.’ STE/EC

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:
(11:99) K atyi’ jike mintyV-chhom khin-ki ajitsiki

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",55.76552581787109,1,0.8626131924063352," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often

independent of the place of its antecedent.",59.00756072998047,1,0.8577994127101491,"144 Adjectives and adverbs
 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as

section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.

‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT

Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:

‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers

naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:

Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",66.28182220458984,4,0.8490471546462117," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.
",69.86177825927734,1,0.8010202341456146," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

"NG think(PR) -2SG thingyear
 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.

is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",1,0.7948093607262869," Notes 481
242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",39.15616989135742,2,0.8503051208231788," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by

way as in declarative clauses:

Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m

380 Clause types
12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",62.230918884277344,3,0.8532761129628327,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were

examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",44.03831100463867,1,0.7034474252041961," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form

forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

12.1.3. Word order in transitive clauses
In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).
",51.46256256103516,1,0.8309499518643657,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:
(13:54) M e’-ki ja e ’ma menbae’-e-dye’ aj-win m o’-tyaka ’
so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM
 phenyo-dye’-si’ shae’a-i Oye.
woman R-NO-L.Frob-VI.M.S Oye
‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.
",40.66175079345703,4,0.8443847764411243," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",44.83884811401367,4,0.8535437518494575," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’

",50.93115997314453,3,0.8321518355901832,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.

number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:

12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses

13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",52.86382293701172,1,0.8247435229338987," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",57.95040130615234,1,0.85567833469979,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.

‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers

a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or

12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses

(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.

13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",58.6303939819336,1,0.8709173507337139," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’
3F.SG-FO-CO one-F frog 3F-ADwait-VI-AN-F.S
 yo-dye’-si’-tom-ra’ phi-ki.
",63.89994812011719,3,0.785831246826088," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",66.171875,1,0.8502839605811205," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",69.44540405273438,1,0.8026505403167814,"144 Adjectives and adverbs
 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’
IP buy-VI.M.S DE.M canoe.E DE.F-B-L.M girl
 jaetn ’-si’.

sohi’-tyi’.
man-L.M
‘He has three daughters and three sons.’ (lit.: ‘His children are
three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:
(13:51) Dyiph m i’aj kinakdye’ ti-wen-ka-’

daerae’-khan mochaj ka-i’ ja e ’n a’-ra’ m i’

‘I know the man with whom Roberto left.’ ELE/RC, FT
 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",1,0.796453440884567,"NG think(PR) -2SG thingyear

These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a

13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",59.69542694091797,1,0.8151924051582833," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",57.53068923950195,1,0.8810169139787125,"1SG house-COM
‘I have a house.’ ELE/CT
When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",55.28634643554688,1,0.8739572263083563,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",61.79966735839844,1,0.8544517310723009," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S

The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:

‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",32.409053802490234,1,0.7630948693519967," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a

In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the

cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",55.08406829833984,1,0.8729583110951868," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.
talk-VY-2SG/l.SG now
 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",39.932613372802734,1,0.8456316359581326,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",44.34061813354492,1,0.8547172255151799,"NX-VI-F.S more thing

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the

",49.788536071777344,1,0.8334967109591898,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:

The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.

question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a

 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct

speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:

The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in

the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na

 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or

 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT

‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",63.84153366088867,4,0.811584619841355," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",47.96155548095703,1,0.7864833482788274,"3F.SG housebig
‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.
 moming-VJ-F.S good-QT-2SG Ricardina momingVJ-F.S
‘Good morning Ricardina, how are you, good morning!’

380 Clause types
12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",57.79171752929688,1,0.8382343484205329," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",59.627960205078125,3,0.8323281793397057,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’

three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",61.33211898803711,1,0.8555932880106466,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",61.62387847900391,1,0.861739167887696," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20

‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",43.72445297241211,2,0.7398227864512577," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",36.58089065551758,4,0.8000734131962308," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:

In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:

 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

12.1.3. Word order in transitive clauses
In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",54.9356803894043,3,0.8896410185984005,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",50.68693161010742,1,0.8574685461575188,"1SG house-COM
‘I have a house.’ ELE/CT
When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",39.334659576416016,1,0.8468423702274671,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391

has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",44.0899658203125,1,0.8558567001407259," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",49.11590576171875,4,0.8583320719465107," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

",57.7110481262207,2,0.8807990721837805,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,
when the word order is changed in the main clause:

so-CO DMmoment live-VI-NO yet-C 3F.SG-EM

‘So she had already lived there for some time, the woman, who
(the jaguar) Oye had robbed.’ STE/EC
The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

asking a direct question in order to get an answer:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):

papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH

are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",38.58051681518555,1,0.8538013321563307,"Interrogative clauses are constructed by combining a clause with a
question marker. The interrogated element is fronted, i.e. appears in
clause-initial position, followed by the question particle. In an
information question, this interrogated element is replaced by an
 9 SO
interrogative pronoun ; in yes/no questions, the interrogated element is
a core or optional part of the clause itself. I will discuss the interrogated
elements below, but before that I will turn to the general word order in
interrogative clauses. Apart from the interrogated element, which
follows another pattern, constituent order in questions resembles that of
declarative clauses. Questions are built up by an interrogated element,
followed by a question marker and the elements of the (declarative)
clause. For verbal clauses that are interrogated, the following scheme
applies:260
Table 49: Word order of information questions
Intransitive:INT Q S V
Transitive:INT 0 A V 0
Table 50: Word order of yes/no questions
Intransitive:X-QS V
Transitive:X-QAVO
The X in yes/no questions and the INT in information questions can be
a fronted core element of the clause, in which case the core element
disappears from its original position in the clause. I will now look at the
interrogated element, as well as at further word-order tendencies in the
different types of questions.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The

morphology is the use of the macrofunctional “linker” morpheme,
which relates elements in a noun phrase. Predicatively used adjectives
are not marked by this linker morpheme. The order in the noun phrase is
usually determiner-modifier-noun, though usually long modifiers, such
as relative clauses, appear after the head noun. Furthermore, the noun
phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",31.53765106201172,1,0.766759095480251," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",43.55134201049805,3,0.7571903928096323," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:

Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).

Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).

256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).

The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",50.65658187866211,2,0.8662479624012751,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the

object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form

forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with

 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",50.02850341796875,1,0.8406703729306538,"The head can also be adjacent to the relative clause, for example,

The following example shows a relative clause marked by V-L. In this
type, the relative clause is not initiated by a marker, but appears on the
426 Clause combinations
verb instead. Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to determine
where the relative clause begins, and the hearer has to rely on meaning
and context. In the following example, the relative clause is adjacent to
the head tata ‘father, priest’:
(13:55) Awer,m i’tata, khin’ ja e ’ma Alto
let’s.see.E 3M.SG fathernow DMAlto
khojka-i ’-tyi
care.for-F.O-L.M
‘Let’s see, the priest, who cares for them in El Alto,...’ COE/JH
Turning to the internal structure of relative clauses, yodye ’-L initiates
these, whereas V-L appears on the verb of the relative clause. Word
order inside the relative clause is generally the same as in declarative
clauses, but with some exceptions: the relativized element is exclusively
referred to by the relative clause marker and its place in the clause is not
occupied. This is demonstrated in the example (13:55) above, where the
head tata ‘father, priest’ is relativized and does not appear - apart from
the verbal cross-reference ending - inside the relative clause. In focus
constructions, the word order in the relative clause can be changed, so
that the relative clause appears before its head, often leading to another
constituent order inside the relative clause as well, where the verb then
appears before the subject.

‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said

NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then

so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",4,0.8468877652720136," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",38.37353515625,1,0.8549028628255833,"NG think(PR) -2SG thingyear
 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.

 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",57.204010009765625,1,0.8406868387877355," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",59.232566833496094,3,0.8499391680355325,"1SG house-COM

When a noun phrase contains both determiner and modifier, nominal
relation marking appears with the determiner:
(4:115) Bae’-i-tsin di-khan aka’ maeV-sV.
live-VI.M.S-lP DE.F-IN housenew-L.F
‘We live in this new house.’ ELE/JH
The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.

376 Clause types
12.1.3. Word order in transitive clauses
In the present section, on word order in transitive clauses, I will mainly
discuss clauses that are not affected by pro-drop (12.1.1).
",55.09374237060547,1,0.8921922404199214," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",60.87651824951172,1,0.8654088864003746,"144 Adjectives and adverbs
 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’
IP buy-VI.M.S DE.M canoe.E DE.F-B-L.M girl
 jaetn ’-si’.

‘We buy this canoe for that good girl.’ ELE/CT

sohi’-tyi’.
man-L.M
‘He has three daughters and three sons.’ (lit.: ‘His children are
three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",61.310546875,1,0.8790878728173396,"3F.SG child other-LF-L.M have-3M.O Elena
‘She cares for the son of another woman, Elena.’ e l e / jh
Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",31.403823852539062,1,0.7685164439803579," Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’
3F.SG-FO-CO one-F frog 3F-ADwait-VI-AN-F.S
 yo-dye’-si’-tom-ra’ phi-ki.
",43.02154922485352,3,0.7740887928022789,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.
",36.31524658203125,0,0.7955699742228628,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",40.25311279296875,0,0.7418182936643611," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?

",42.8986930847168,3,0.9116366287947538," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",47.96684265136719,1,0.908896895120846," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:

one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",50.54595947265625,0,0.8597212360511907," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the

affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",38.712650299072266,1,0.8491643564341385,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,

in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative

linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker

restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial

 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.
",47.65738296508789,3,0.8363409230590272," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:

 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.
",57.19181442260742,3,0.8566509345804755," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",60.779815673828125,1,0.8664039368029525,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender

agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",61.29819107055664,0,0.8725886566480585," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:

",31.10815620422364,3,0.7850141053145862," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n

followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.

With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).

There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).

Predicate clauses will be discussed below.

The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes

According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,

... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while

",51.67475509643555,2,0.8614851028236162,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the

object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference

markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",57.47620391845703,1,0.8717857292098284," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

affirmative clause:

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",57.18323516845703,1,0.8576915575744578," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

",58.91753387451172,4,0.8739079715667296,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:
(8:15) Jedye-dye-si’-dye’-ki-ra’ ka-ti-’?

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",55.9077262878418,1,0.8930485817586711,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",53.964500427246094,0,0.8865067439460922," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:

yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",60.55926513671875,4,0.8891518501407341," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 ij-a-n-yae.

 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",31.050575256347656,0,0.7793154024580305," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",42.63637161254883,3,0.7919055594336099,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",34.89653778076172,0,0.7986345163046723,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.
",39.8239860534668,0,0.738328080897823," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",42.00219345092773,1,0.9202660971452012,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?
 how-NO-MO so-VY-lPI-F.O eat-VI-MI-NO

je-k-e ’tshij-dye-si ’?
 take-DK-3F.O fire-B-L.F
 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",46.50079345703125,1,0.9175663603778482,"NG think(PR) -2SG thingyear
 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:

 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani

13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",37.42283630371094,0,0.8441070167302233,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:
(8:15) Jedye-dye-si’-dye’-ki-ra’ ka-ti-’?
 thing-B-L.F-NO-CO-IR bring -1PI.S-F.0
‘Why should we bring it?’ STE/EC

 beat-AN-lPI.S.M.O-IR EM-MO kill-VI-lPI.S.M.O
 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:
(8:17) J o ’dye’y d ’ jam ajtsin dyai-dye’-ra’ tsin
 and NG yet IP many-NO-IR IP
j a e ’ma ti-kse-ja’y i- ’-tsa’dyij-ye-dye’

(8:18) Sob-a-kse-ja ’mi ’-in nanatyi ’-in.
 visit-VI-3P.0-1PI.S 3M-P boy-P
 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.
 call-3P.0-lPI.S-IR NG-IRDE.F dry-VY-F.S chicha
 ‘We will call them, the chicha will not stop (lit. ‘dry in’).’
 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",51.216346740722656,1,0.8624906328324029,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.

There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",61.803131103515625,1,0.8487581001263564,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",68.42681884765625,1,0.8643522874318489," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?
",68.70460510253906,2,0.890029864009698
" Often, word order in the main clause is not changed, even if a
relative clause follows. Since relative clauses usually are placed at the
end of the main clause, they are often not adjacent to their head. This is
shown in the following example, where the head of the relative clause,
tetei ‘frog’ appears before the verb of the main clause, and is not
adjacent to the relative clause yodye’sitomra’ phiki ‘with whom he
would run’:
(13:53) M o’-na-ki jiri-s tetei md’-ya’ bis-a-ki-’

 yo-dye’-si’-tom-ra’ phi-ki.
",3,0.8788792730032389," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.
",37.671974182128906,4,0.8938535012048429," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",58.894805908203125,1,0.8748073197564398,"Following an emphatic particle such as m e’, nash can be used to
introduce a story or a conversation, focusing on what will be said:

kx-i- ’ me ’-ish ats-iyae.
sow-VI-3F.O so-then come.M.S-VI 1SG
‘I want to sow peanuts, therefore I have come.’ STE/VJ
Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",55.34146881103516,3,0.9080763592268188," Notes 481
242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",53.53747177124024,2,0.8944487063090539," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?
want-VI-3F.O-QY sleep-VI-F.S-2SG
‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?
sleep-VI-F.S-QY want-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Do you want to SLEEP?’ ELE/JH

Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix

Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",39.40779113769531,1,0.7401944492136207,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?
 how-NO-MO so-VY-lPI-F.O eat-VI-MI-NO
 ‘How in the world could we do this to the animal!’ COE/VC
(12:61) Ahe-i-ya’jedye’-dye’-ra’ o-we-ra’ yae
 rain-VI.M.S-AD thing-NO-IR F-DR-IR 1SG
je-k-e ’tshij-dye-si ’?
 take-DK-3F.O fire-B-L.F
 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",41.77476501464844,1,0.9208347971818488," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",46.15930938720703,1,0.9181543162184084,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:
(8:15) Jedye-dye-si’-dye’-ki-ra’ ka-ti-’?
 thing-B-L.F-NO-CO-IR bring -1PI.S-F.0
‘Why should we bring it?’ STE/EC
 Verbal inflection 187
(8:16) P a ’-ki-ti-ra’tyaka’-dyera’ ij-a-ti.
 beat-AN-lPI.S.M.O-IR EM-MO kill-VI-lPI.S.M.O
 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:
(8:17) J o ’dye’y d ’ jam ajtsin dyai-dye’-ra’ tsin
 and NG yet IP many-NO-IR IP
j a e ’ma ti-kse-ja’y i- ’-tsa’dyij-ye-dye’

 ‘And we haven’t brought people from outside, but that was the
 priest’s idea.’ COE/SM
(8:18) Sob-a-kse-ja ’mi ’-in nanatyi ’-in.
 visit-VI-3P.0-1PI.S 3M-P boy-P
 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.
 call-3P.0-lPI.S-IR NG-IRDE.F dry-VY-F.S chicha
 ‘We will call them, the chicha will not stop (lit. ‘dry in’).’
 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",53.99271774291992,1,0.9007776012878768,"Following an emphatic particle such as m e’, nash can be used to

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",50.07244873046875,3,0.8988018414846172,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",36.9456787109375,0,0.8380864448760739," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions

also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",56.6411247253418,2,0.8879643906908813," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:

(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.

section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form

a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the

",58.78728485107422,3,0.8897088901728077,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with

derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the

antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",41.47091293334961,1,0.9213898931292834," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?
want-VI-3F.O-QY sleep-VI-F.S-2SG
‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?

",46.01475143432617,3,0.932751943220082," With pronominal subjects, the two main types of relative clauses
differ in their internal constituent order. In relative clauses marked by
 V-L, the pronominal subject usually appears after the verb, in the same
way as in declarative clauses:
(13:56) M i’yae tye-te kirjkajiri-ty soni’
3M.SG ISG give-3M.O bookone-M man
chhii-ye-te-tyi’mi.
know-VY-3M.O-L.M 2SG
‘I gave the book to a man, w hom you k n ow .’ ELE/DM
In relative clauses marked by yodye ’, on the other hand, the pronominal
subject usually precedes the verb:
Relative clauses 427
(13:57) M i’ yaetye-tekirjka jiri-ty soni’
 3M.SG 1SGgive-3M.O bookone-M man
yo-dye’-tyi’mi chhn-ye-te.
",53.8585319519043,3,0.9154970715198376,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?
 how-NO-MO so-VY-lPI-F.O eat-VI-MI-NO

je-k-e ’tshij-dye-si ’?
 take-DK-3F.O fire-B-L.F
 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",50.06981658935547,1,0.8995114296076814," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.

See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",49.72861099243164,1,0.8573462726818051," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.

‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:

make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",56.18878173828125,1,0.8887499695876943,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender

of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

" Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",1,0.8944850834747022," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",37.47994613647461,1,0.8953247470980594," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?

",47.17265701293945,3,0.8547177057224461," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix

Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.

According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,

... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and

267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to

269

before -ki.

consistent.

The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",40.75196838378906,1,0.8627313822015105,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to

this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

",47.01713562011719,1,0.8833927654101167," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:

before the subject:

When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:

 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:

These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",54.837345123291016,1,0.8648892686038901," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",56.07851028442383,1,0.8895172627305721," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

(12:78)q Este hospital huerfano-dye-si ’ jaetaej-yi- ’-dyash
this.hospital.E orphan.E-B-L.F make.noise-VY-F.S-QI

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?
",56.31410598754883,2,0.9007378305770388," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

discussed in section 4.7.
",63.47906112670898,1,0.8893248378817212,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.

See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",1,0.8952012605983283," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?
want-VI-3F.O-QY sleep-VI-F.S-2SG
‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?
sleep-VI-F.S-QY want-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Do you want to SLEEP?’ ELE/JH
 (12:73) Mi-dyajrai’s-e-’ khosh-'i-’?
",36.99191665649414,3,0.9096101232176428,"NX-VI-F.S more thing
‘There do not exist more things.” STE/JH
Finally looking at the word order with negative quantifiers, the negation
always appears before the quantifier(s). These markers can be adjacent,
or other elements can appear in between. The elements that can appear
in between are often adverbials, such as aj ‘yet’, though also other the
subject of the clause may appear between the negator and the negative
quantifier, as in example (10:28) above.
",46.9477424621582,1,0.8557038018978106," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

The order of elements inside the noun phrase is rather free, though there
are some tendencies that I will elaborate on here.
",59.9221305847168,1,0.9130925739556486," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.

 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.

",37.15943145751953,2,0.7454056714178926,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",41.35455322265625,0,0.908824299262572," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:

‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",45.62889099121094,0,0.9200313976787337,"PS-EH enter-VT.M.S-P night-VI-F.S say-DS-F.S-P
‘And then they entered, “good night”, they said.’ STE/vc
The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:
284 The verbal system
(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.

In the present section on intransitive clauses, I will exclusively consider
those clauses that appear with a full NP or a pronoun in subject position,
i.e. where the subject does not undergo pro-drop.249 I will start with
clauses, in which the subject is realized as a full noun phrase, and move
on to those clauses, where the subject is a pronoun.

Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.

See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",45.90892791748047,2,0.8868449918766201," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the

In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the

elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

phrase can also be split up and a verb can appear between the different
parts of the phrase.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",36.89128494262695,1,0.9102141766383356," When replacing
optional elements, the core elements of the clause appear after the
 Interrogative clauses 393
interrogative pronoun and the question marker. In the following
example, the interrogative pronoun jedyei ‘why’ queries an optional
element of the clause, while not affecting the core parts ‘they suck the
bibosi-tree’:
(12:65) Jedye-i am m i’in tvim ’-tebiki?
 thing-VI.M.S QN 2P suck-VD.3M.O bibosi.tree
‘Why are you sucking the bibosi-tree?’ WTE/JH
The constituent order in this question is as follows: the interrogative
pronoun is in clause-initial position, and is followed by the question
marker am and the rest of the clause. The constituent order of the
elements following the question marker is slightly different from word
order in declarative clauses, where a pronominal subject usually follows
the verb. In interrogative clauses, there is a tendency for pronominal
subjects to appear before the verb in transitive and intransitive clauses.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",57.46720886230469,0,0.8919993337314168," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.
",54.30512237548828,1,0.9105018256200248," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",52.80891799926758,1,0.9107932521055192,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",59.17428588867188,0,0.9069905997928204," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",52.84809494018555,1,0.9172688375518562," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20

say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

",45.79825592041016,1,0.8876011790975635,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to

this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",46.513771057128906,1,0.8984423799603694," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",54.00087356567383,0,0.8735045345212199," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?

from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20

‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",55.43097305297852,1,0.9020704098597716,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender

agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement

agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",61.11740493774414,0,0.8607075700083728," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial

 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,

astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).

Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and

The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.

I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main

279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb

281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.

from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-

"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in

types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive

without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",29.63667869567871,3,0.8080994559191487,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’
IP buy-VI.M.S DE.M canoe.E DE.F-B-L.M girl
 jaetn ’-si’.

man-L.M
‘He has three daughters and three sons.’ (lit.: ‘His children are
three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",31.19101905822754,1,0.8000651418430879,"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.
",35.730003356933594,0,0.7421891829139329,"Following an emphatic particle such as m e’, nash can be used to
introduce a story or a conversation, focusing on what will be said:

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.

",45.0181884765625,2,0.9210324874060668,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?

 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",52.75350189208984,1,0.9178134207261964,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",49.61085891723633,2,0.908774895328531," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

this.hospital.E orphan.E-B-L.F make.noise-VY-F.S-QI

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262
Adverbials and emphatics in word order 397
 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?

‘She cares for the son of another woman, Elena.’ e l e / jh
Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",39.72567367553711,1,0.8787431723382702," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",45.779178619384766,1,0.8883410515333888,"Following an emphatic particle such as m e’, nash can be used to
introduce a story or a conversation, focusing on what will be said:

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",46.212493896484375,3,0.9122760175633438,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",49.30068588256836,0,0.8680887871849169," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",53.87022399902344,1,0.8743371990226195,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses

Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279

Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of

Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",63.24399185180664,3,0.904694508881414," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",66.60826873779297,1,0.890254291565394,"3F.SG housebig
‘The house is big.’ ELE/CT
The subject precedes the predicate in the unmarked constituent order. In
focus constructions, the order of predicate and subject is reversed:
(12:25) Daer katyi’ wo’ko-md’.
 big EH stomach-3F.SG
‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):
(12:26) Nai-jo-’ ja em ’-dye-mi Ricardina nai-jo-’.
 moming-VJ-F.S good-QT-2SG Ricardina momingVJ-F.S

380 Clause types
12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:
(12:28) M e’ nash tsin di-khan otel.
",67.26591491699219,1,0.9215896023985571
"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

",36.418601989746094,2,0.9113304426972436,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.
",46.65509796142578,0,0.8587001932214392," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",55.14643096923828,1,0.9114232745755392," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",57.3082160949707,1,0.893406194787868," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",53.165775299072266,1,0.905127799679014,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:
(8:15) Jedye-dye-si’-dye’-ki-ra’ ka-ti-’?

 beat-AN-lPI.S.M.O-IR EM-MO kill-VI-lPI.S.M.O
 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:
(8:17) J o ’dye’y d ’ jam ajtsin dyai-dye’-ra’ tsin

(8:18) Sob-a-kse-ja ’mi ’-in nanatyi ’-in.
 visit-VI-3P.0-1PI.S 3M-P boy-P
 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.
 call-3P.0-lPI.S-IR NG-IRDE.F dry-VY-F.S chicha
 ‘We will call them, the chicha will not stop (lit. ‘dry in’).’
 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",52.24301910400391,1,0.9119552958587798," With the applicative -tye- appearing before -ti- the meaning is a
combination of ‘take from another person’ and ‘for a reason’:
(9:67)Tsin y a ’-i-tye-ti-te jiri-s waka y a ’-i-dye-si’
IP buy-VI-APD-REA-3M.O one-Fcow.E buy-VI-B-L.F
shiish.
meat
‘We have bought a cow from someone (we know what to do
with it) in order to sell meat.’ ele /AT, lm
In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",59.36726379394531,1,0.9061538938212744,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender
190 The verbal system
agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

‘So we started yesterday, now we also go on with the
sentences, like w e started.’ STE/JH
Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani
phi-yi-ti ’khin ’.
talk-VY-2SG/l.SG now
 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",49.43048477172852,1,0.9093666310720184," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.
",34.97869873046875,1,0.8644976226041454," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S

‘Big was her stomach.’ WTE/CT
Very frequent adjective predicate structures can be formed by cliticizing
a 1st or 2nd person subject pronoun to the predicate.254 This is, for
example, the case in the question ‘how are you’ (A) and the answer ‘I’m
fine’ (B):

12.2.3. Locative predicates
Locative predicates express that someone or something is in a certain
location by juxtaposing a subject noun phrase and a locative predicate.
In Moseten, locations are expressed by a place adverb (6.4.1.) or by a
noun phrase marked by a local nominal relation marker (4.1.5. - 4.1.8.).
In the following example, the subject tsin ‘we’ is juxtaposed to the
predicate dikhan otel ‘in this hotel’:

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.

Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

language?’ COE/JH

Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",54.82866668701172,1,0.9119896696965876," DMsend-VD.DT-10 DM Germany.E-DR

Usually, the patient-‘secondary object’ appears after the primary object
in word order.
",57.29660415649414,1,0.8940877983458775," Notes 481
242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
250
The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.
",53.09693908691406,2,0.9121288518116342,"144 Adjectives and adverbs
 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’

‘He has three daughters and three sons.’ (lit.: ‘His children are
three daughters and three sons.’) e l e /jh
These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",57.559837341308594,1,0.9023441031645656," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:
396 Clause types
(12:78)q Este hospital huerfano-dye-si ’ jaetaej-yi- ’-dyash
this.hospital.E orphan.E-B-L.F make.noise-VY-F.S-QI
tsin-si-s-khan huerfano?
lP-L.F-RD.s-IN orphan.E
‘This orphan-hospital - how do we say orphans in our
language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262
Adverbials and emphatics in word order 397
 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?
",57.92937850952149,2,0.9131483846962604," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?

‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?
sleep-VI-F.S-QY want-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Do you want to SLEEP?’ ELE/JH
 (12:73) Mi-dyajrai’s-e-’ khosh-'i-’?

 ‘Don’t you remember what year it was?’ COE/JH
These clauses can also be interpreted as direct question, marked by a
question marker, such as -dyash:
(13:76) M e’-dyaj mi dyijjedye’-dyash-ra’ yowahV,
 so-QY 2SG think(PR) thing-QI-IR yowani

 ‘So, do you remember what this yowani ’ (main actor in a story)
is; tell me about it now.’ STE/VC
13.4.4. Word order in complement clauses
In the present section, I will discuss the position of the complement
clause in relation to the matrix clause, as well as the word order inside
complement clauses.
",29.66186714172364,1,0.8090772665743395," With the applicative -tye- appearing before -ti- the meaning is a
combination of ‘take from another person’ and ‘for a reason’:

meat
‘We have bought a cow from someone (we know what to do
with it) in order to sell meat.’ ele /AT, lm
In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.
",33.30709457397461,0,0.7455500029841584," As mentioned in 3.1. above, only verbs have inflectional forms.
Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",39.35139083862305,0,0.8867957791421772," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

(12:78)q Este hospital huerfano-dye-si ’ jaetaej-yi- ’-dyash
this.hospital.E orphan.E-B-L.F make.noise-VY-F.S-QI

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?
",44.13471603393555,2,0.8961690943169455," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:

‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

",53.0622673034668,1,0.8823957100067977,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.

 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",54.83152389526367,1,0.906162331085983," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.
",54.4145393371582,1,0.9169072396819884," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",62.70037841796875,1,0.8994731133483501," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?
want-VI-3F.O-QY sleep-VI-F.S-2SG
‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?
sleep-VI-F.S-QY want-VI-3F.O-2SG
‘Do you want to SLEEP?’ ELE/JH
 (12:73) Mi-dyajrai’s-e-’ khosh-'i-’?
",66.49944305419922,3,0.904452170582826," In word order, jam is either placed at the beginning of the negated
clause (10:2) or alternatively (without a change in meaning) before the
verb (10:3). Example (10:1) shows jam in combination with an
affirmative clause:
(10:1) Yae jaem -e-’ shokdye’.

",2,0.8920027141895032,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to

this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",36.10885620117188,1,0.9060989153770136," Usually, complement clauses appear in object position of the matrix
clause, i.e. after the matrix verb. This order can be changed to O A V
when the object is focused, in the same way as in transitive declarative
clauses (12.1.3.). This fronting of an object complement is found when
the object complement is rather short and at the same time focused:
(13:77) Aj-in chojw-e-te-in aej-a-tera i’s-e-’-in.
yet-P rage-VI-3M.O-P kill-VI-3M.O want-VI-3F.O-P
‘They were angry with him and wanted to kill him.’ STE/EC
The complement clause aejate ‘kill him’ precedes the matrix verb
ra i’s e ’ ‘want it’.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an

inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally

In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the

elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this

verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following

general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted

the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or

Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’

The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.

One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain

different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",54.55426406860352,3,0.919365789627027,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.

 STE/VC
8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.
",54.05477142333984,1,0.9174312114455152,"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

242
This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.
251
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.
252
Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",25.781688690185547,1,0.825460072898902," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S

 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.
",28.797801971435547,0,0.8052406866861861," Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -

Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

This marker has no gender agreement forms and is not related to the linker (4.8.).
243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.
249
See appendix II for statistics about the word order in written texts.

The context of this example can be seen in the text ‘The story of the Armadillo’ in
the appendix.

Furthermore, different topic markers such as -ki (13.2.1.) can then help to
differentiate between the participants.
253
See also examples in section 5.1.
254
Compare this with cliticization with intransitive (12.1.2.) and transitive (12.1.3.)
verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.
261
The notion o f ‘core’ elements is somewhat misleading, since this term includes
verbs, subjects and objects. The latter two are core elements, but can be “deleted”
from the clause by pro-drop, as they occur in the verbal cross-reference ending.

Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to

Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the

I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:
(13:64) Karij-tya-ki raej-dye-sV mayedye’
 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",46.06676864624024,0,0.8748470964572765,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender

person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd

question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:

 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the

elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:

verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted

Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked

243
Another form, realized with nasal vowels watyeke, means ‘suddenly’.
244
One purpose for the speaker using this marker could be to keep the interest of the
hearer.
245
In verbalized forms, this marker is also used to express ‘accept’ja-yi-, even if ja
itself does not have a positive or negative implication, and can appear in negated
clauses as well.
246
With these parts of speech, it has the meaning ‘big’ (4.6.3.) and can be used in
superlative constructions (6.3.2.).
247
This marker is not to be confused with chhome’ ‘also’.
248
This verb appears in combination with a temporal particle and an evidential that
are optional elements in a clause.

the appendix.

differentiate between the participants.

verbs above.
255
There are few examples which use mo ’we, such as jes mo ’we tyabedye ’ ‘there are
many fish [in the river]’. Other place adverbs, such as dya’ or m oya’ (see 6.4.1.1.)
are never used in this structure.
256
This resembles the use of abikio ’ above, expressing an accusation, rather than a
question.
257
Another marker, -dye, appears with degree adverbs (6.4.4.).
258
The question marker abi ’ does not appear in combination with —ka ’, which may be
caused by the closeness between questions marked by a b i’ and rhetorical
questions: a b i’ expresses that the speaker does not expect the hearer to know an
answer to his question.
259
Question markers show that the interrogative pronouns are used in questions and
not as subordinations, or other functions ( see 5.4.1. for an example where jaen ’ is
used as a subordinator).
260
Predicate clauses will be discussed below.

marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Chapter 13
Clause combinations
In this chapter, I will look at coordination and subordination of clauses
in Moseten. Formally, subordinated clauses are part of the main clause,
while coordinated clauses are two separate main clauses linked for
various reasons. I will discuss the following types of clauses:
 1.Coordination by juxtaposition and by j o ’dye’y d ’. In this section, I will
also look at the coordination of constituents. 2. Contrastive marking of
adjacent clauses, which is a type of marking that frequently appears in
coordinated, but also in subordinated clauses to express a contrastive
meaning. 3. Relative clauses, which formally are modifiers in noun
phrases, as well as headless relative clauses that can be used
 adverbially, 4. Complement clauses, i.e. clauses that take over a subject
 or object function within another clause. In this case, the main clause
will be called the ‘matrix’ clause. 5. Adverbial clauses, which have an
 adverbial function within another clause. 6. Indirect speech and 7.
 Participial clause combinations. Furthermore, I will look at word order
 in the different clause types. In the sections on word order, I will
 generally bold, underline and italicize verbs, subjects, and objects
 respectively. In the other sections, I will bold the markers discussed in
 these sections, such as jo ’dye ’y d ’ or -ki, or the clauses described such
 as adverbial clauses or relative clauses.
 13.1. Coordination
 There are basically two ways of coordinating constituents and clauses:
 by juxtaposition of the elements or by combining the elements with
j o ’dye’y d ’. Both coordinating devices can be used to combine clauses
 and constituents. In the combination of clauses, juxtaposition can
 express succession in time, as well as actions happening at the same
 time, whereas jo ’dye ’y d ’ can only be used with actions happening at the
 same time.
",53.35513305664063,3,0.9307259039753936," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20

say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.

According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

",3,0.8999538793339099,"Given these facts about the 3rd person plural object marker -kse-, I
assume that this marker acts as a derivational suffix instead of as an
inflectional marker. It seems that this derivational marker has acquired
inflectional uses. Furthermore, this suffix appears to be intransitive in
nature, due to the fact that the intransitive 1st plural inclusive subject
form - j a ’ is added to -ksi- instead of a transitive marker. Another
argument for this claim is that 3rd person plural object forms generally
agree with the gender of the subject, whereas 3rd person singular object
forms agree with the gender of the object ( 8.1.2.3).
8.1.2.3. The category of gender in the cross-reference paradigm
The cross-reference system of transitive verbs contains some forms
agreeing in gender with an argument, while other forms do not show
such agreement. All 3rd person object forms show gender agreement
with a number split with respect to their antecedent: singular 3rd person
object forms inflect for the gender of the object, 3rd person plural object
forms agree with the gender of the subject of the clause (see the
previous section 8.1.2.2. for an explanation). Furthermore, 1st person
inclusive plural subject forms (of transitive verbs) show gender

agreement with the object of the clause. Table 21 summarizes the forms
of the cross-reference markers in the 3rd person object forms and the 1st
person plural inclusive forms, in order to show the gender agreement
structure in transitive cross-reference. Only forms which show gender
agreement are shown in the table.

8.1.2.4. The category of number in the cross-reference paradigm
Most cross-reference markers in the paradigm involve number marking
of the subject or object. An exception is the cross-reference marker -n
that can be applied to 3rd person singular or plural subjects, as well as 1st
person singular and plural (exclusive) objects.153 Furthermore, 3rd
person object forms are marked for number, while the corresponding
subject forms do not show these distinctions.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were

been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:

and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH

12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses

I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.

204

One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

 12.5. Adverbials and emphatics in word order
 Optional elements in the clause, such as discourse markers and
 adverbials, do not have a fixed place in the constituent order. As a
 tendency, discourse markers, such as emphatic particles and modality
 markers (11.2. and 11.3.), appear at the beginning of the clause, while
 adverbials, such as ‘in the house’ or ‘yesterday’, can be placed in
 different positions in the clause.

In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:

from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:

The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.

modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.

The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to

203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.
",47.69126892089844,0,0.906090638500438," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:
394 Clause types
(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,
 3M.SG-QY-QR-CO back-VK.M.S-CO 3M-DR go-DK-M.S
 waem ’tvi ’-mo ’ jaen ’-dyash-ka ’?
 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):
(12:70) M e’-dyaj mi rai’s-e-’khosh-'i-’?
so-QY 2SG want-VI-3F.0 sleep-VI-F.S
‘Do you want to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:71) R ai’s-e-’-dyaj khosh-'i-’-mi?

‘Do you WANT to sleep?’ ELE/JH
(12:72) Khosh-i-’-dyaj rai’s-e-’-mi?

",33.32941436767578,3,0.8870627243489398," The internal constituent order of adverbial clauses does not differ
from declarative clauses (12.1. and 12.2.). When the marker of the
adverbial clause is a particle, it appears at the beginning of the clause,
without changing the word order in the rest of the clause.
13.6. Indirect speech
Indirect speech is not marked in a special way in Moseten. In the same
way as direct speech, it is preceded or followed by the quotative verb yi-
‘say’:
(13:99) Khaki waemtyi’-mi m e’-ki’ wae-wa’-ki-n
 because husband-2SG so-size beat-VI.PR-PT-20
 yi- ’-mi, yi-bi-ti ’ yae yij mi.
say-F.S-2SG say-APB-2SG/lSG 1SG footprint2SG
‘Because your husband is beating you like that, you said, you
said to my footprint.’ STE/EC
The clause in bold is the repetition of what another person said,
followed by the verb yi- ‘say’. Knowing the context of this example,
one can interpret the bold part as indirect speech. Apart from this
 Participial clause combinations 443
interpretation, however, the clause in bold can also express the
imitation of direct speech, citing another person who had said to a
woman “your husband is beating you”. In this way, direct speech and
indirect speech are formally not distinguished in the language.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",43.30705261230469,0,0.9050774224105193," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the

antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

",0,0.8999538793339099," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial

 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.
",53.816837310791016,0,0.8957941142635895," With the applicative -tye- appearing before -ti- the meaning is a
combination of ‘take from another person’ and ‘for a reason’:

with it) in order to sell meat.’ ele /AT, lm
In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:

say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",56.19107437133789,0,0.8987203058828873,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.

number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:

",50.47311782836914,2,0.9263822823275104,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",44.37345123291016,1,0.9399380730063952,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.

When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.

See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.

According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).

The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle

I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.

The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.

I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.

The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.

I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.

The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).

In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker

out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.

question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:

With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct

speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.

and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:

complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object

Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.
",56.91303634643555,0,0.902989136293424," Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.
",34.8869514465332,0,0.8320090743339897," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,

Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

",26.576963424682617,2,0.8436458155847895," When the interrogative pronoun replaces a core element in the
clause, this element is deleted from the clause. In the following
example, the verb is replaced. The interrogative pronoun is verbalized
and no verb appears after the question marker am:
(12:66) Jaen’-ye-team-ra’ m i’ini
 how-VY-3M.O QN-IR 2P
‘What will you do to him?’ WTE/JH
In yes/no questions, the interrogated element is fronted, followed by the
markers -dyaj or -dyej. Again, I will differentiate between fronted core­
elements and optional elements fronted. In case of the latter, the marker
is followed by the clitic -dyaj, and the constituent order follows this
question marker resembling the order in declarative clauses:
(12:67) Jam-dyaj nai-tva-ksi-mi yae-si’ awa’-in?
no-QY see-VD-3P.O.M.S-2SG 1SG-L.Fchild-P
‘Haven’t you seen my children?’ WTE/JH
In intransitive clauses, however, there is a tendency to place the verb
before the subject:

(12:68,) A-dyaj daer-i kaedaei-mi?
 yet-QY big-VI.M.Sbaby-2SG
‘Is your baby already growing?’ COE/JH
When a core element of the clause is interrogated, this argument is
fronted and appears in clause-initial position, followed by -dyaj. In the
following example, the fronted element mi ’ ‘he’ appears again after that
clause in an apposition, waemtyi’ m o’ ‘her husband’:
(12:69) Mi ’-dvai-ka ’-ki jae-ki-kim i’-we jij-ka-i,

 husband-3F.SG how-QI-QR
‘Didn’t he follow after her (there), her husband, how was it?’
 COE/JH
When the action expressed by the verb is interrogated, the verb is
fronted in the clause. In an analytic construction of two clauses, both
verbs can be fronted, leading to different questions. In the following
examples, the clause mi ra i’s e ’ khoshi’ ‘you want to sleep’ is
questioned. This can be carried out in four different ways: with the
general question, in which an optional particle appears in fronted
position (12:70), with the question about the clause ‘want’ (12:71), with
the question about the clause with the content verb ‘sleep’ (12:72), or
with the question about the subject (12:73):

clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).

I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",38.84616088867188,2,0.93156955837049," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.

‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

 (12:83)qIits-na tata jam ji-te-te?
",43.57413101196289,2,0.936073710398387,"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative
verb and example (6:3) a noun. All these forms are marked by the
linker, as they stand in modifying position:
(6:1) Tsin y a ’-iiits kasko di-dye-tyi’ nanasi’

These examples show that different parts of speech can be used as
modifiers in the noun phrase when marked by the linker (treated in
section 4.8.). The order of adjectives (modifiers) and head nouns is
discussed in section 4.7.
",46.27935409545898,1,0.9120711383780868,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:

Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

" Wayne Gill belongs to the North American protestant New Tribes
Mission and has been a missionary with the Chimane people since the
early 1980s. Interested in languages, he learned Chimane and created a
writing system for the language. He printed a Chimane-Spanish and
Spanish-Chimane dictionary, published school books and religious
booklets (all under the name of Mision Nuevas Tribus). Furthermore, he
translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament. For new
missionaries, starting at the mission with the Chimane, he wrote a
“teach-yourself-Chimane” manuscript, consisting of grammatical
information, religious phrases and everyday speech. The grammatical
information is very good and reliable. He is continuously collecting
words for a manuscript dictionary of Chimane-English, which in 1999
consisted of more than 5000 words and derivations of words, - and
example clauses for most entries.

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

 ‘We will beat it (the tapir, M) and thus kill it.’ STE/VC
With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:
(8:17) J o ’dye’y d ’ jam ajtsin dyai-dye’-ra’ tsin

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:
(11:91) Khaki majmi jam-bVanik ja em ’-nae’-ban-’-in.
 because roadNG-still EM good-put-VD.again-3F.O-P
‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC
370 Modality and discourse markers
This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:
(11:96) M d’-ki phenj i ’chhaekaen-tye-te
3F.SG-CO woman answer-VD-3M.0
 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.
sit-VI-F.S-first moment-L.F shadow-IN
‘First, she was sitting for a while in the shadow.’ STE/EC

dyij-yi-chhom-ra ’-yae.
think-VY-first-IR-ISG
‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:
(11:99) K atyi’ jike mintyV-chhom khin-ki ajitsiki

‘It is said that he was a man at first, but now he lives as (i.e. is)

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

‘My name is Jeanette.’ (answer to the question ‘what is your
name?’) ele /jh
In the following example, it is applied in order to focus an adverbial
phrase, expressing ‘up there is a lot!’:
(12:91) M o-jd’-chhe’-ya ndja’khd ara-si’!
",54.698856353759766,0,0.8907116359676174," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:
(8:281) Tranquilo wen-chhi-yae nitsiwa-wa-i’
quiet.Emove-DC.M.S-lSG NG.Ecold-RD-VI-F.S
se 'w-e-
feel-VI-3F.O
‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

",56.66946792602539,0,0.902989136293424,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

424 Clause combinations
13.3.4.4. Relative clause markers and the associative
My informants also accepted the associative in relation to the relative
clause marker both in the long form yodye ’-L-min and the short form
yo-min. I could not elicit any differences in meaning between these two
forms. The associative relation (on its own) is very infrequent and there
are no text examples of this form together with the relative clause
marker.
13.3.5. Other relative clause markers
As alternatives to the types of relative clause marking discussed above,
a couple of other elements can be used as relative clause markers: the
interrogative pronouns j a e ’na’ (13:51) ‘where’ and tyitom (13:52) ‘with
whom’, the latter consisting of tyi ‘who’ and the comitative relation
marker -tom. The marker tyitom is exclusively used with human beings:

 13.3.6. Word order in relative clauses
 What is the constituent order in the main clause and the internal
 constituent order in the relative clause? The order of elements in the
 main clause is independent of the type of relative clause involved. The
 Relative clauses 425
relative clause generally appears at the end of the main clause, often
978
independent of the place of its antecedent.",34.50257110595703,1,0.8379521595214985," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is

reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:

8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

‘And then they entered, “good night”, they said.’ STE/vc
The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.
",48.14705657958984,1,0.932325367515019," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

(12:78)q Este hospital huerfano-dye-si ’ jaetaej-yi- ’-dyash
this.hospital.E orphan.E-B-L.F make.noise-VY-F.S-QI

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

sentences, like w e started.’ STE/JH
Complement clauses 429
13.4. Complement clauses
Complement clauses appear in subject or object position of a matrix
clause, and are thus subordinated to this clause. There are three types of
complement clauses in Moseten: finite complement clauses, non-finite
complement clauses and indirect questions. In general, only object
complement clauses are found in the language, whereas subject
complements only very rarely occur. The latter can, however, be
elicited:

 hard-VD-AN.M.S all-B-F.Sday
 ij-a-n-yae.
 kill-VI-1SG.O-1SG
 ‘Working all day kills me.’ ELE/AT
Since all my other examples of complement clauses are object
complements, I will generally refer to them as “complement clauses” in
the remainder of this section. The following table shows the different
types of complement clauses, some of the matrix verbs they appear
with, as well as restrictions on their form:
Table 53: Complement clauses
 Meaning of matrix verb Restrictions
Finite complementwant, must, seem, stop,co-referent subjects in matrix
clausesfinish, begin, know (how clause and complement clause279
 to), etc.
Non-finite beg, forbid, etc.primary object of matrix clause is
complement clausesco-referent to subject of
complement clause
Indirect questions remember, etc. introduced by interrogative
pronoun
13.4.1. Finite complement clauses
Finite complement clauses can appear in transitive and intransitive
matrix clauses. Intransitive matrix clauses are often derived by the
430 Clause combinations
antipassive, as the demoted object complement is apparent in the clause
without being inflected in the cross-reference ending. Due to the
relatedness in form with object complements of transitive verbs, I will
treat these structures under the same heading. The verbs in complement
clauses are finite and can be inflected both intransitively and
transitively. The subject of such a verb is co-referential with the subject
of the matrix clause.

Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.
sleep-VI.ITR-DC.M.S
‘He came here (interrupting his movement here to sleep).’

In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.
",33.61936950683594,0,0.9138016576187576," Relative clauses can be marked in two ways: 1. by addition of the
linker to the verb of the relative clause, marking a restrictive relative
clause or 2. by starting the relative clause with the relative marker
yodye’-L, marking a non-restrictive relative clause. The latter can mark
restrictive relative clauses with plural antecedents, when appearing in
the partially reduplicated form yodyedye-L.271 Furthermore, yodye’-L
and the short form yoj ‘like’ can take over oblique functions in
combination with nominal relation markers (4.1.). Formally headless
relative clauses, structures marked by yoj ‘like’, have adverbial
 412 Clause combinations
 functions. Apart from these markers, a number of interrogative
 pronouns can appear in the same place as relative clause markers,
 expressing similar concepts. I will furthermore discuss constituent order
 in relative clauses, and look both at the placement of the relative clause
 within the main clause, as well as at the constituent order in the relative
 clause.
",44.33169174194336,1,0.8874152461653675,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:

‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT

Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill

11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR
katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",54.4233512878418,4,0.9143395561907268,"The antipassive marker -ti- can furthermore appear with the verb yi-
‘say’, expressing that a quotation is a request. In this way, the
antipassive is similar to the imperative (8.1.5.) is used in direct speech
to express requests. In the following example, a man asks another
person to do something, which is expressed by the imperative in the
quoted speech. The verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive marker
-ti- in order to express that the preceding quotation is a request:
The antipassive- 313

‘ “Let’s see, shoot again at the cuchi-tree and then take your

WTE/JH
In the following example, the verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive
-ti- in order to mark the following quotation as a request:
(9:36)Jike yi-ti-dyera’ kha-in “waila nigra!”

‘And then they entered, “good night”, they said.’ STE/vc
The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.
",55.87093353271485,0,0.902989136293424," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is

Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",24.533935546875,0,0.8455627824780279,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system

order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.

Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:

‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

 A number of other elements are marked by the linker when appearing
in modifying position (see section 4.8. on the linker). The following
examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.
Example (6:1) below shows a “real” adjective, example (6:2) a stative

recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.
",30.671119689941406,1,0.9169693194303372,"This formal deletion, however, does not change their status as core elements of the
clause.
262
When the answer is positive, a marker such as anik ‘sure’ is used.
263
See the transitive clauses below for occurrences of “objects” with verbs marked by
the antipassive, similar to shara ‘gourd’ in this example.
264
Compare this with the fronting of objects in word order (12.1.3.).
265
According to Moseten mythology, people saying to an animal ‘if you were human,
482 Notes
... ’ will meet this animal in a human shape shortly after. The people are often
astonished and wonder where this other “human” comes from. This example is the
answer of a transformed animal, referring to what the person said right before (and
to its consequences).
266
Compare this to example (12:95) above, where chhibin ‘three’ is fronted and
focused by -na.
267
The coordination of fully inflected verbs is very different from participle
constructions, in which only one main verb occurs (8.9.).
268
I have only one example of the marker jo ’dye’, which is used to relate a clause to
the context. Mostly, the formj o ’dye’y a ’ is used.
269
Only the marker na appears in this combination, whereas naja ’ cannot appear
before -ki.
270
Compare this example to (13:9) in section 13.2.1.
271
The marking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is usually very
consistent.
272
These are the possible functions of the relativized element, according to the
accessibility hierarchy, proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
273
Apart from adverbial relative clauses, treated in 13.3.3. below.
274
The first translation is the one I first got from my informants.
275
The personal pronoun agrees in gender with the subject of the main clause.
276
I.e. whether a relativized element can be interpreted as having the role of a
possessor is not marked on the element and depends largely on the context.
277
The noun daerae’ can both mean ‘tree’ and ‘mountain’, i.e. this example could also
be understood as ‘on top of the mountains,... ’.
278
I mainly refer to text examples here. In elicitation examples, the relative clause
usually appears directly after its antecedent, in different places within the main
clause. In texts, however, the orders describes here are prevalent.
279
These restrictions can be removed, marking the complement clause by paj ‘for’.
280
Usually, only one noun phrase appears in this type of adverbial clauses, as the verb
is always intransitive or intransitivized.
281
This particle can also be used in finite complement clauses (13.4.1.) to express that
the subject of the matrix clause is not co-referent with the subject of the
complement clause.
282
The meaning ‘let’ can also be expressed by a causative structure (9.4.2.).
283
In these examples, I only mark in bold the elements in which -w i’- occurs.
284
The construction ‘sit for a while’ is expressed by analytic progressive aspect
marking (8.5.1.), consisting of two juxtaposed verbs: bae’i- and the content verb.
",36.22247314453125,2,0.9254580591905792," Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).
",41.38322830200195,0,0.9290008149884864," With the applicative -tye- appearing before -ti- the meaning is a
combination of ‘take from another person’ and ‘for a reason’:
(9:67)Tsin y a ’-i-tye-ti-te jiri-s waka y a ’-i-dye-si’
IP buy-VI-APD-REA-3M.O one-Fcow.E buy-VI-B-L.F
shiish.
meat
‘We have bought a cow from someone (we know what to do
with it) in order to sell meat.’ ele /AT, lm
In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

",50.41432189941406,0,0.9431842925346008," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:
(8:281) Tranquilo wen-chhi-yae nitsiwa-wa-i’
quiet.Emove-DC.M.S-lSG NG.Ecold-RD-VI-F.S
se 'w-e-
feel-VI-3F.O
‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

Possessive clauses have a separate negation marker daerae’ (10.3.).
12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be
Interrogative clauses 383
applied to both verbal and predicate clauses. The majority of questions
appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.
",1,0.905825987185579," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:
(8:281) Tranquilo wen-chhi-yae nitsiwa-wa-i’
quiet.Emove-DC.M.S-lSG NG.Ecold-RD-VI-F.S
se 'w-e-
feel-VI-3F.O
‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",33.41009521484375,0,0.9138016576187576,"The antipassive marker -ti- can furthermore appear with the verb yi-
‘say’, expressing that a quotation is a request. In this way, the
antipassive is similar to the imperative (8.1.5.) is used in direct speech
to express requests. In the following example, a man asks another
person to do something, which is expressed by the imperative in the
quoted speech. The verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive marker
-ti- in order to express that the preceding quotation is a request:
The antipassive- 313

say-AT.M.O-EH-P
‘ “Let’s see, shoot again at the cuchi-tree and then take your
arrow out again.”, he says to him.’ (i.e. requests him to do)
WTE/JH
In the following example, the verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive
-ti- in order to mark the following quotation as a request:
(9:36)Jike yi-ti-dyera’ kha-in “waila nigra!”

‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.

Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we
like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

",47.776145935058594,4,0.9378587769252092,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.

story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.
sleep-VI.ITR-DC.M.S
‘He came here (interrupting his movement here to sleep).’

",38.33626937866211,2,0.9492207541296056,"This grammar is primarily based on textual data. Some texts were
recorded by me, while others were collected by Juan Huasna. His data
are very good, since he had access to language varieties that were
difficult for me to record. Furthermore, he was able to interview the
speakers in Moseten and ask questions about uncommon words. Some
examples in the grammar are based on elicitation data. They have all
been checked with various different speakers, in order to guarantee the
correctness of the data.
",41.98196792602539,0,0.9479237756416732," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",34.54164123535156,0,0.9254580591905792,"Such verbs are dyijchhi- ‘remember’ andyakchhiti- ‘begin’. In most cases, the path
of lexicalization is synchronically unclear.
202
The form of the 1st person plural inclusive subject is -jija ': khoshe-ji-ja' ‘we go to
various places to sleep.’
203
The masculine form of this marker is often followed by an aspiration, which I mark
by - j in the examples.
204
Below, I will discuss some instances where this is not the case.
205
One possible analysis of -min- and -j- is that -min- expresses the interruption of
the movement in order to do the action, while -j- expresses an ongoing action.

Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd
person plural object forms, the distributive marker follows the -ksi-:
(8:311) Ya-kse-jij.
say-3P.O-DS.M
‘Go to them (individually) to tell them (something).’ ELE/JH
8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

(8:312) Saeks-e-min-jo-’.
eat-VI-ITR-DJ-F.S
‘She went (there), ate and went away (after eating).’
ELE/AT, LM
In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:
(8:313) Khdsh-m'in-chhi.

‘He came here (interrupting his movement here to sleep).’

 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we

",51.75191879272461,0,0.925473435069402,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the
188 The verbal system
cross-reference marker for the 3rd person. This differs from the general
order of affixes in verbs, where only clitics can appear after the verbal
cross-reference ending. Derivational suffixes usually precede the
inflectional marker in verbs.

372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive

With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

",23.38127899169922,1,0.8553563215469039,"There are two forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject in the
transitive paradigm: those with a 3rd person singular object and those
with a 3rd person plural object. The latter formally resemble reflexive
forms (8.2.3.): -ti (1st person plural inclusive subject with a masculine
object) and - t i ’ ( 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
object). In these forms of the 1st person plural inclusive subject, gender
agreement is with the object and not with the subject. The following
examples show the 1st person plural inclusive subject with a feminine
singular object (8:15) and a (8:16) masculine singular object:

With a plural object, the 1st person plural inclusive subject forms
involve the marker for plural objects -ksi- (discussed in section
8. 1.2.2.), as well as the 1st plural inclusive subject marker - j a ’ used in
the intransitive inflection (8.1.1.). Together they form the cross­
reference marker -kseja ’. This marker is undifferentiated for gender:

 ‘We visit the boys.’ ELE/JH
In the same way as - n ’ (undifferentiated for gender) can be used to
mark the 1st person plural inclusive in the intransitive paradigm ( 8. 1. 1.),
this marker can also appear combined with -kse- ‘3rd person plural
object’:
(8:19) Worwa-kse-n’-ra’ jam -ra’ di tyas-yi-’shokdye’.

8.1.2.2. The forms of the 3rd person plural objects
The forms of the 3rd person plural objects in the cross-reference
paradigm differ in many ways from the other forms. When derivational
markers are added to the verbal stem, they commonly appear after the

examples show how different parts of speech can be used adjectivally.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object
forms, marked by -ksi-, as discussed before (8.1.2.2.). With the 3rd

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.
This is also the case in the following example, where the movement to
the deictic center was interrupted in order to sleep:

" Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

language?’ COE/JH
(12:79)a Yaj-ka-k-tyi ’-in.
leave-VK-PP-L.M-P
‘Orphans.’ COE/EC
Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:
(12:80) Jaetaej-yi- ’-dyashphe-ya-k-dye ’-mo ’?
make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?
good-QY live-F.S child-2SG woman-2SG
‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.
good-IPevery-all-lP
‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

‘In 1962 my mother died, I wasn’t bom yet (sic!).’ COE/EC
In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:
(11:91) Khaki majmi jam-bVanik ja em ’-nae’-ban-’-in.

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:

so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?

‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:
(12:3)Jene m i’jiri-ty mintyi’ chhijtt-a-kikatyi’m e’-we

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

In this case, the reason is the idea of killing the cow and selling the
meat, expressed in a purposive adverbial clause, following the clause
marked by the applicatives.
9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.
",22.8062801361084,0,0.8573069981813661," Questions similar to those have a single word as their answer,
applying the question as the antecedent:

the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:

make.noise-VY-F. S-QI talk-VY-MI-NO-3F. SG
‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH
(12:82)a Jaem ’-tsin waj-raej-tsin.

‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

booklets (all under the name of Mision Nuevas Tribus). Furthermore, he
translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament. For new
missionaries, starting at the mission with the Chimane, he wrote a
“teach-yourself-Chimane” manuscript, consisting of grammatical
information, religious phrases and everyday speech. The grammatical
information is very good and reliable. He is continuously collecting

Derivation is found with all parts of speech, but it is most common with
verbs. There is no definite and fixed order of affixes in Moseten.
Generally, one can say that inflectional forms seem to follow
derivational forms, but there are some exceptions to this as well
(8.1.2.2.). Usually, the rightmost element has scope over all elements to
the left.

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive

8.6.6. The -min- interrupted movement marker
With other parts of speech, the marker -min- has several functions, such
as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of

a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.

8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these

Introduction
The language Moseten is spoken in Bolivia, in the eastern foothills of
the Andes. Together with Chimane (Tsimane’), it forms the language
family Mosetenan. This language family has not yet been proved to be
related to other languages.

9.6. Combinations of voice structures
Different voice structures can be combined, giving rise to a
compositional meaning. These types of combinations are rather rare,
and not all voice structures can appear together. Thus, causative and
applicative prefixes cannot be applied to the same verb. In the same
way, two elements of the same voice structure cannot be combined.
Still, it is possible to elicit a number of co-occurring voice structures.

Mission and has been a missionary with the Chimane people since the
early 1980s. Interested in languages, he learned Chimane and created a
writing system for the language. He printed a Chimane-Spanish and
Spanish-Chimane dictionary, published school books and religious
booklets (all under the name of Mision Nuevas Tribus). Furthermore, he
translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament. For new
missionaries, starting at the mission with the Chimane, he wrote a
“teach-yourself-Chimane” manuscript, consisting of grammatical
information, religious phrases and everyday speech. The grammatical
information is very good and reliable. He is continuously collecting
words for a manuscript dictionary of Chimane-English, which in 1999
consisted of more than 5000 words and derivations of words, - and
example clauses for most entries.

",44.6728630065918,0,0.9499079813288028," Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).
",41.27038192749024,0,0.935702686919327," In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is

Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.

‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

as associative relation marking of nouns (4.1.3.) and plural marking of
adjectives (6.1.3.). With verbs, this marker expresses the interruption of
a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from

",55.28163909912109,2,0.9084331731946416,"The antipassive marker -ti- can furthermore appear with the verb yi-
‘say’, expressing that a quotation is a request. In this way, the
antipassive is similar to the imperative (8.1.5.) is used in direct speech
to express requests. In the following example, a man asks another
person to do something, which is expressed by the imperative in the
quoted speech. The verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive marker
-ti- in order to express that the preceding quotation is a request:

",56.73341751098633,0,0.937833942231854," Franz Caspar (1953)24, a Swiss anthropologist, lived with the
Mosetenes in Covendo from 1943 to 1947, with several interruptions.
Interested in the stories and the language, he compiled a word list -
containing roughly 1500 words - of the language in manuscript-form.25
Caspar also wrote a number of sections on the phonology of the
language. He noticed both the significance of the glottal stop, which he
usually transcribed -c-26, and of nasality. Furthermore, he has few pages
of notes on pronouns and numerals, as well as on “prepositions”, i.e.
postclitics (4.1.).

" In the following example, the verbal root tsiwae- ‘be cold’ is
partially reduplicated, with a change in the last vowel from -ae- to -a-:
(8:281) Tranquilo wen-chhi-yae nitsiwa-wa-i’
quiet.Emove-DC.M.S-lSG NG.Ecold-RD-VI-F.S
se 'w-e-
feel-VI-3F.O
‘I came here quietly, it did not even feel co ld .’ COE/MW
Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).
",0,0.9232759571146768,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:

 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
",30.289045333862305,1,0.9427684201753862,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?

world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?

Apart from verbal roots, also nominal forms can be partially
reduplicated and followed by a verbal stem marker. These forms usually
express carrying objects of the form described by the noun:
(8:282) Saerae’-rae-i.
long.object-RD-VI.M.S
‘He carries a long object.’ ELE/JH
8.6. Associated motion
There are a number of different associated motion markers in Moseten:
-ki- ‘go away to do an action’, -ti-l-sh- ‘come to do an action’, -kho- ‘to
perform on the way there’, -chhi- ‘to perform on the way here’, -ji-
‘perform an action in various places’ and finally the marker -min-
‘interruption of the movement to do the action’ (which is used together
with other associated motion markers to express that the movement was
interrupted in order to do the action). Moseten has no marking for
upriver or downriver in the associated motion system. Instead, these
notions are found in the system of nominal relations (4.1.).

",52.33351135253906,2,0.9437705914480736," Wayne Gill belongs to the North American protestant New Tribes
Mission and has been a missionary with the Chimane people since the
early 1980s. Interested in languages, he learned Chimane and created a
writing system for the language. He printed a Chimane-Spanish and
Spanish-Chimane dictionary, published school books and religious
booklets (all under the name of Mision Nuevas Tribus). Furthermore, he
translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament. For new
missionaries, starting at the mission with the Chimane, he wrote a
“teach-yourself-Chimane” manuscript, consisting of grammatical
information, religious phrases and everyday speech. The grammatical
information is very good and reliable. He is continuously collecting
words for a manuscript dictionary of Chimane-English, which in 1999
consisted of more than 5000 words and derivations of words, - and
example clauses for most entries.

In the same way, this clitic frequently occurs together with the general
negation jam, resulting in the meaning ‘not yet’:

 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:
(11:92) Aj ish-katyi’aj mi-chhe’-ya’ watyekem o’-chhe’
yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.
yet one-Fwoman stand-VI-RD-F.S
‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.
yet.then DMagain b low - VY-APD-3F.0 ear
‘And then he blow s (in) her ear again.’ STE/CT
In the following example, ish is used to refer to what has been said
before in the context:
(11:94) Jamyok-si’ ish-md’m e’ yok-si’abaya’ ish
NG other-L.F then-3F.SG soother-L.F abaya’ then
me ’ abaya ’ ish.
so abaya’ then
‘No,this is another one, abaya’ it is, abaya’ it is.’ COE/VJ
Often, this particle is used together with the marker -w i’- ‘necessity’
(11.2.2.) when complaining about a person, usually one’s own partner:
(11:95) Jaen’-dye’ ish-wi’iitsm e’ waemtyi’ yae-tyi’?
how-NO then-MN DE.M sohusband 1SG-L.M
‘Why should my husband be like this?’ STE/EC

This particle frequently appears in replies to greetings, for example
naijo’ ish ‘good morning’ as the reply to naijo ’ ’good morning’:

 “nai-jo-’ish ” y i- ’-katyi’ m o’ phen.
moming-VJ-F.S then say-F.S-EH 3F.SG woman
‘And the woman answers “good morning”, says the woman.’
WTE/JH
Furthermore, ish is used in interjections such as je i ish! ‘I want to kill
and eat it’, exclaimed when an animal is in a good position to be hunted.
11.5.8. -chhom ‘f irst’
The clitic -chhom has the meaning: ‘first’, expressing that one action is
prior to something else.247
(11:97) Bae’-i-’-chhom men-si’ enom’-khan.

‘Wait a little, Jeanette, I first have to think.’ ELE/JH
This clitic can be added to all kinds of parts of speech. It has scope over
the element that is marked, which in the following example is the noun
‘man’:
(11:99) K atyi’ jike mintyV-chhom khin-ki ajitsiki

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

like 3M.SG one-M manhunt-VI-AN.M.S EH so-DR

‘say’, expressing that a quotation is a request. In this way, the
antipassive is similar to the imperative (8.1.5.) is used in direct speech

person to do something, which is expressed by the imperative in the
quoted speech. The verb yi- ‘say’ is marked by the antipassive marker

a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in

‘My name is Jeanette.’ (answer to the question ‘what is your

",49.964088439941406,0,0.9437705914480736,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?

 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?

Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:

‘Because they have not yet made the road good again.’ STE/CT
 Temporal reference particles 369
11.5.7. ish 'then’, context reference
The particle ish expresses a relation to the context, usually that of a
succession in time. In the following example, ish expresses a succession
in time to the preceding context:

yet then-EH yet 3M-SU-AD suddenly 3F-SU
aj jiri-s phen dyon-i-ni-’.

‘When he was further down (the road), suddenly a woman
stood there.’ WTE/JH
The examples where ish expresses a succession in time usually involve
marking by aj ‘already, yet’ as well (11.5.4.). In fast speech, this
combination of aj and ish is realized as ash:
(11:93) Ash ja e ’ma kiwi phij-ye-tye-’ wej.

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

The distributive associated motion marker is not used with transitive
cross-reference forms. An exception to this are 3rd person plural object

a movement in order to do an action. It appears in relation to the
associated motion markers -jo- (8.6.3.) and -chhi- (8.6.4.), which
express that an action is carried out while moving towards or away from
the deictic center. The associated motion marker -kho- (8.6.3.) in
relation to the marker -min- is realized as -jo-:

In this example, the construction of the interrupted movement marker
and the associated motion marker expresses a movement away from the
deictic center with an action done on the way. This action is not carried
out while moving, but the movement stopped for this action to be done.

 Chapter 12
 Clause types
In the present chapter, I will treat various clause types, examine how
they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).

eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

they are constructed and look at the different constituent orders which
appear. I will discuss the following clause types: 1. verbal clauses, 2.
predicate clauses, 3. interrogative clauses and 4. answers to questions.
Furthermore, I will look at the constituent order of adverbials and
discourse markers, which appear optionally in the clause. Finally, I will
discuss focus and topicalization structures. Negated clauses and word
order in negation were discussed in section 10.
12.1. Verbal clauses
In this section, I will look at affirmative declarative main clauses which
are constructed around a verb. Verbal clauses can be intransitive,
transitive or ditransitive. Formally, only two arguments can be marked
in the verbal cross-reference ending (8.1.2.). Consequently, ditransitive
clauses appear with two arguments in the cross-reference ending only
(8.1.4.). There is a basic constituent order in Moseten, that may vary
depending on the arguments in the clauses, as well as the pragmatics
involved. In the present section, I will look at pragmatically marked and
unmarked intransitive and transitive clauses, and discuss word order and
the presentation of arguments. The latter is the way in which
participants are formally marked: whether they appear as full noun
phrases in the clause, whether they are substituted by pronouns, or
whether they exclusively occur in the cross-reference ending of the verb
due to pro-drop.
 12.1.1. Pro-drop
The arguments of a verb can appear in the verbal cross-reference ending
 only, but not as full noun phrases or pronominal forms. This
372 Clause types
phenomenon is frequently referred to as pro-drop. In this way, the basic
intransitive clause in Moseten, containing all obligatory elements,
consists only of an intransitive verb (12:1) and the basic transitive
clause of a transitive verb (12:2).
(12:1)Saeks-i-’.
eat(in)-VI-F.S
‘She eats.’ ELE/JH
(12:2)Tyaj-ka-ksi- ’.
meet-VK-3P.O-F.S
‘She meets them.’ e l e /jh
At the text level, elements have to be introduced into the discourse
before they can be dropped by pro-drop. Thus, at the beginning of a
story, the referents are introduced and in this way made identifiable. For
this purpose, they are represented by full noun phrases. Later, when
identified, a participant can be referred to by a pronoun or by pro-drop,
appearing exclusively in the cross-reference ending of the verb. This is
demonstrated in the following three clauses from the beginning of a
story. In relevant examples in this chapter, I have marked subjects with
an underscore, verbs are bold and objects are regular:

katyi ’ chhijn-a-ki tsikin’-we ojni’.
",18.659008026123047,4,0.8838109950988681,"In the following example, -ka’ is added to the general information
question marker -dyash, changing the information question into a
rhetorical question. In this question, the speaker does not directly ask
 for the answer to the question ‘what is it called’, but instead expresses
that he knew the name before and cannot remember it right now:
390 Clause types
(12:57) Jedye’-dyash-ka’ m o’t i ’-i-’-si’aka’ yo-khan
thing-QI-QR 3F.SG name-VI-F.S-L.FhouseR-IN
 ydj-ka-k-tyi ’ bae ’-i-inhuerfano.
leave-VK-PP-L.M live-VI.M.S-P orphan.E
‘What was the house called where the orphans live?’ COE/EC
With the clitic -dyaj, marking yes-no questions, -ka’ turns a direct
question into a rhetorical yes/no question. In the following example, a
speaker asks himself whether a certain road already existed, instead of
asking a direct question in order to get an answer:
(12:58) Jdf-dyaj-ka’majmi aj Karanawi-we.
already-QY-QR road yet Caranavi-DR
‘Was the road to Caranavi already there?’ COE/EC
Furthermore, the question marker am can be used together with -ka ’:
(12:59) Jedye’-am-ka’ mi chhii-ye-’.
thing-QN-QR 2SG know-VY-3F.O
‘What do you know then (if you don’t know this)?’ COE/AM
Apart from these uses in relation to question m a r k e r s , ’ appears in a
number of fixed structures such as ja e n ’w i’ka’ ‘however it might be’
and shedyesh-wi’-ka’ ‘hopefully’, together with the (deontic) modality
marker -wi ’-(11.2.2.).
12.3.1.7. -dye’ with interrogative pronouns
The marker -dye ’, similar in form to the nominalization marker -dye ’
(4.4.1.), can be added to interrogative pronouns, expressing rhetorical
questions with a high degree of emphasis, usually translatable as ‘... in
the world’. It always appears in combination with the irrealis marker
-ra ’ (11.2.1.) or another modality marker, such as -dyera’ (11.2.6.) in
the following example:
Interrogative clauses 391
(12:60) Jaen’-dye’-dyera’ m e’-yi-ti-’ jeb-a-k-dye’?
 how-NO-MO so-VY-lPI-F.O eat-VI-MI-NO
 ‘How in the world could we do this to the animal!’ COE/VC
(12:61) Ahe-i-ya’jedye’-dye’-ra’ o-we-ra’ yae
 rain-VI.M.S-AD thing-NO-IR F-DR-IR 1SG
je-k-e ’tshij-dye-si ’?
 take-DK-3F.O fire-B-L.F
 ‘When it rains, what in the world will I take to make a fire
 here?’ STE/EC
The combination of the interrogative pronoun j a e ’n a’ ‘where’ and -d y e ’
has the fixed meaning ‘how in the world’, instead of ‘where in the
world’:
(12:62) Jae’n a’-dye’-ra ’ yae oichhash-i-n-in?
where-NO-IR 1SG DE.F reach-VI-10-P
 ‘How in the world would they reach me?’ STE/EC
 12.3.1.8. Questions without question markers
Most questions in Moseten are marked by question markers. Questions
that appear without these markers are usually one-word comments with
a rising tone. The following example consists of the word mama’
‘papa’, marked by the clitic -na ‘focus marker’ (12.6.2.):
(12:63) Mama’-na
papa-FO
 ‘And papa?’ (what about him, will he join us?) ELE/JH
Many of the questions which are constructed without a question marker
are linked to the context by -na (see 12.6.2.). In the following example,
the question consists of a one-word clause without question marker or
-na:
(12:64) Khin ’-ya-dye ’?
 now-AD-time
 ‘At this time o f the year?’ COE/JH
392 Clause types
12.3.2. Word order in interrogative clauses
In the present section, I will look at word order in interrogative clauses.
I will only take those interrogative clauses marked by a question marker
into account, and not treat the comment-type of questions discussed in
12.3.1.8. above.
