"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",5,1.0," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",66.74230194091797,5,1.0,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

Enxet Sur in which 1) the relative order of s-argument NPs to one another and to the

elements in a sentence is instead determined by pragmatic factors which include expect-
edness, information structure, and newsworthiness. Generally speaking, most languages
which are claimed to have a “free word order” are likely to have a pragmatically based
word order instead, and word order is governed exclusively by information structure
as opposed to being governed primarily by clausal syntax. Again, as a predicate-initial

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",61.75407028198242,5,0.7453270245068674," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).
(5.60) a. Context: Speaker is looking at a page of a children’s book describing palo santo.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and

order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",56.84275817871094,5,0.7787414119967426,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",58.33697509765625,3,0.8619234631012523," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

",56.77602767944336,5,0.8126574325241042,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",58.08572006225586,5,0.8643359178905535," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",63.98566436767578,5,0.8304198973631919," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",64.67757415771484,4,0.8380949023880852,"Furthermore, word order has to be considered within a perspective where some if
not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.
",71.96435546875,5,0.9123589900943762," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",75.76858520507812,5,0.8643359178905535
"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",5,0.854220419125481,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically

argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked

clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",42.8514289855957,5,0.8776329377530736,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

for ‘The jaguar bit Carlos’; ‘Carlos’ ranks higher on the animacy hierarchy than ‘jaguar’
 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",63.615966796875,5,0.6203123078961198,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made

as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet

The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

elements in a sentence is instead determined by pragmatic factors which include expect-
edness, information structure, and newsworthiness. Generally speaking, most languages
which are claimed to have a “free word order” are likely to have a pragmatically based
word order instead, and word order is governed exclusively by information structure
as opposed to being governed primarily by clausal syntax. Again, as a predicate-initial

order. Instead, it is the order of nominal expressions after a verbal predicate which is
“pragmatically based”.

(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

",63.0599250793457,5,0.655101361382188,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",63.954288482666016,5,0.7850152716205042," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

",70.10049438476562,5,0.7970018454479152,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",41.10785675048828,1,0.6775530025724191,"Enxet Sur is a predicate-initial language with an otherwise pragmatically determined
word order. Nominal predicates play an important role in the basic grammar of the lan-
guage, as nominal expressions which reference the semantic arguments of verbs are of-
ten realized syntactically as the nominal predicates of independent clauses, instead of
as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet
Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.

languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",53.50674819946289,5,0.848166037330417,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated

(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",63.71565628051758,5,0.8625618335428544,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",60.404205322265625,5,0.8334610233222834,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",56.22686004638672,3,0.7309894656961052," Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",51.81875228881836,5,0.8326729782843858,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",57.1953010559082,1,0.8331881004460187,"In terms of both the topic-comment structure and the given-new structure, Enxet Sur,
somewhat unsurprisingly, shows comment-topic and new-given as unmarked, typical or-
ders. Several verb-initial or predicate initial languages, some rather well-studied, have
been described as having a comment-topic order as the unmarked information structure
of the sentence (Van Valin, van Valin Jr, van Valin Jr, LaPolla, and LaPolla, 1997), includ-
ing Tagalog (LaPolla, 2019, Nagaya, 2007, Naylor, 1975, p. 48), Uto-Aztecan languages

scribed as “free word order” languages also show a tendency for an order of new-given in
opposition to given-new (Mithun, 1992, Tomlin and Rhodes, 1992).

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.
",58.7109375,5,0.8639400703112865,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",67.82862854003906,5,0.8049556134474918,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",60.671180725097656,5,0.816967286312505,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",45.42496871948242,5,0.7976458377858742,"Furthermore, word order has to be considered within a perspective where some if
not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word

description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",63.660865783691406,5,0.7843987474894472," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).
(5.60) a. Context: Speaker is looking at a page of a children’s book describing palo santo.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",68.19175720214844,5,0.8090937404853414,"Furthermore, word order has to be considered within a perspective where some if
not all of the s-argument NPs that occur near verbs are not really clausal constituents.
Therefore, we must deﬁne in strict terms what we mean by “basic word order”. If it
refers only to the order of constituent arguments in a syntactically cohesive clause, the
clause structure of Enxet Sur is limited to the predicate, its complement, and additional
clausal elements like tame, adverbs, and demonstratives, as described in §5.1. To discuss
the order of V, A, and O elements within Enxet Sur syntax, we are inherently involving
multiple clauses. This is still a useful descriptive exercise, but it is not exactly answering
the question about clausal structure generally intended in a description of basic word
order. Henceforth, then, note that any description of the order of multiple s-argument
nominal expressions inherently involves multiple clauses.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order

it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-
biguation is necessary. However, there is little descriptive value — I’d argue none — in
calling Enxet Sur a “VAO/VSO language”.
",51.64086151123047,5,0.8128035407056957,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",60.38741302490234,1,0.7886400067299612,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",63.04124450683594,5,0.8799439428445601,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",62.165283203125,5,0.7050786833964745," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",40.56600189208984,3,0.6959746792412889,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.
",55.73430633544922,5,0.7500235106927616,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",51.638126373291016,1,0.7879077204182023," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",57.01861953735352,1,0.7883863947194246,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",51.87744903564453,5,0.8813622155438807," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",55.60727691650391,4,0.7621718837134388," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",57.43359756469727,5,0.7937779543446158,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",63.62461471557617,5,0.7996537781232491,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,

nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-

" Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

",40.85974884033203,4,0.8452712472639055," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

",51.25817108154297,5,0.8247131269940524,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",62.68283081054688,3,0.8621336885492669,"The latter of Powys’ statements is a good point of departure for describing basic word
order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

 This strict VAO ordering may be used in these de-contextualized instances of equal-
animacy s-arguments, and therefore could be considered the “basic word order”, since
it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-
biguation is necessary. However, there is little descriptive value — I’d argue none — in
calling Enxet Sur a “VAO/VSO language”.

a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",40.53784942626953,5,0.7153170097803971," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",57.036529541015625,5,0.8068979634332114," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",62.01899719238281,5,0.7398153387869704," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

",62.86022567749024,5,0.8378198042660943,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

Enxet Sur in which 1) the relative order of s-argument NPs to one another and to the
verb is not determined by or indicative of their semantic role, and 2) the relative order of
elements in a sentence is instead determined by pragmatic factors which include expect-
edness, information structure, and newsworthiness. Generally speaking, most languages
which are claimed to have a “free word order” are likely to have a pragmatically based
word order instead, and word order is governed exclusively by information structure
as opposed to being governed primarily by clausal syntax. Again, as a predicate-initial
or verb-initial language, Enxet Sur does not have an entirely pragmatically based word

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",63.44863128662109,5,0.8112629475031822," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",63.17097091674805,1,0.8500458239368308,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",63.3888053894043,5,0.8457155260201076," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

" When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

",5,0.8253974793604045,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",40.716304779052734,1,0.819505862498348,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,

in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",50.65878677368164,5,0.8228173121278382,"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.
",58.41461944580078,5,0.8579127784665453,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",44.594635009765625,1,0.8004629264185218,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",56.57217025756836,5,0.8655015392983623,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",56.65420150756836,5,0.7839031988121581,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",63.38303756713867,5,0.8212779783805759,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame
=demonstrative.
",66.65147399902344,1,0.79839533390092," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",50.72093200683594,5,0.8408678168938558," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",40.05329513549805,5,0.7076864282317237,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

 This strict VAO ordering may be used in these de-contextualized instances of equal-

it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet

this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",72.14873504638672,1,0.81926011025594,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",50.46454620361328,3,0.8298807865627792," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",59.452903747558594,1,0.7933143799379724,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-

have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other
language where constituent order in NPs is dependent upon semantic or even grammati-
cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

5.2.2 Word Order in verbal declaratives
A basic typological question for any language is constituent order in the basic indicative
clause, primarily the order of the verb (V) in relation to a single intransitive argument
(S) or to the agent (A) and patient (O) of a transitive clause. Enxet Sur is unarguably a
predicate-initial or verb-initial language, but as described in §5.1, the nature of the rela-
tionship between verbs and NPs which refer to their s-arguments is complex. Although
we can, in elicitation, come up with a disambiguating VAO word order (see below), there
are a number of confounding facts which mean that this VAO “basic word order” is not of
much descriptive value. Word order does not indicate grammatical labels, and the order
of s-argument NPs is pragmatically determined, similar to what has been described for
closely-related Enlhet Norte (Kalisch 2019).
",39.51591873168945,5,0.7210201235365583,"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame
=demonstrative.
",54.64815521240234,1,0.7537326901557194,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple

typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.

value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",49.929344177246094,5,0.8391927501575309,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.
",55.50312805175781,1,0.7838005049178266," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",50.046875,1,0.8140579316193179,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

nominal expression does not have any syntactic cohesion with the verb except for in the

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",5,0.848293375897756," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet
Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.
",61.11510467529297,5,0.8488682336258392," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.
",49.8184928894043,3,0.8289906281269595,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in

arising.”

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",59.227840423583984,3,0.7612765303463253,"First, to establish some terminology, take the example in (13.47).

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical

their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most

This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial

",43.47345352172852,5,0.8251912244183502,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",49.46893310546875,1,0.877093937769674," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse
and has not been brought up, leading to the opposite order of (5.60a).

",54.73028564453125,5,0.7673403077100239,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.
",55.7431640625,5,0.846682348759923," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

somewhat unsurprisingly, shows comment-topic and new-given as unmarked, typical or-
ders. Several verb-initial or predicate initial languages, some rather well-studied, have

of the sentence (Van Valin, van Valin Jr, van Valin Jr, LaPolla, and LaPolla, 1997), includ-

",60.73476791381836,4,0.8085105007050528,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",62.18827438354492,5,0.7882541755536199,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",61.96446990966797,0,0.80454397716678,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",65.92587280273438,5,0.8236618910913435," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

",68.97743225097656,5,0.8864385682809792,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.

a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",1,0.7988002285179727,"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a

 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",39.8650016784668,1,0.7847672764652202,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles

overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",66.82970428466797,5,0.8293279266589695," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

",68.57003784179688,5,0.8396072042000041," Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",38.351898193359375,5,0.7224667417428072," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",53.71773910522461,1,0.7520030855529994,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

 This strict VAO ordering may be used in these de-contextualized instances of equal-
animacy s-arguments, and therefore could be considered the “basic word order”, since
it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-
biguation is necessary. However, there is little descriptive value — I’d argue none — in
calling Enxet Sur a “VAO/VSO language”.

want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants

the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,

a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.

position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-

syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.

",2,0.7845352245238758,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",39.800106048583984,5,0.7924661077128698,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

",58.84906005859375,2,0.74247700085509," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha
tetet yámet ek-tem-e xáma panaqte neg-m-a-wán-a
ibis tree f.part-be.ti-nm:pv one medicine 1pl.part-ti-vblz-able-nm:pv
ag-máha
1pl.irr-have-amb.nm:po
‘The Ibis Tree (Spanish yerba de lucero is a medicine we can use’
 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",59.46329879760742,1,0.7258240518864825,"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 mud =tc:hod 1sg.pat.dist-cover-val-val-compl-scnd 1sg.poss-eye-pl
 ‘He put mud on my eyes’
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",66.29812622070312,3,0.8211249128294508,"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.
",68.38257598876953,3,0.8310365026795223," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",53.944862365722656,5,0.8156617437746048,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).

In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",56.67110824584961,5,0.8529158376609444," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",42.99799346923828,4,0.8015088539362479,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.
",49.025146484375,1,0.8500652048490321,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns

13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their

word order. Nominal predicates play an important role in the basic grammar of the lan-
guage, as nominal expressions which reference the semantic arguments of verbs are of-
ten realized syntactically as the nominal predicates of independent clauses, instead of
as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet
Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.

of the sentence (Van Valin, van Valin Jr, van Valin Jr, LaPolla, and LaPolla, 1997), includ-

languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.

is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-

have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core

there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate

this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",38.08568954467773,5,0.7465539124501291,"The latter of Powys’ statements is a good point of departure for describing basic word
order, as he suggests that a VAO order is used to disambiguate semantic roles of argument
NPs. In direct elicitation work with consultants, there seems to be some truth to this. In
(5.54), where A and O are both humans (equal animacy) of the same grammatical gender
(therefore no disambiguation of agent on the pronominal inﬂection of the verb), there is
a clear VAO order, and the reordering of the two NPs has a distinct change on the reading
of the grammatical relations.

 This strict VAO ordering may be used in these de-contextualized instances of equal-
animacy s-arguments, and therefore could be considered the “basic word order”, since
it is the word order which apparently disambiguates semantic roles where such disam-
biguation is necessary. However, there is little descriptive value — I’d argue none — in
calling Enxet Sur a “VAO/VSO language”.
",52.640419006347656,5,0.7464216286214826,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

",52.95841217041016,1,0.8414719539024673,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.

in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based

(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical

the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",59.18716812133789,1,0.7273152503931459,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",60.1630973815918,5,0.7831081875719054,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",65.7868881225586,5,0.8437917467723887,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",68.29881286621094,5,0.8531794909434671,"In terms of both the topic-comment structure and the given-new structure, Enxet Sur,
somewhat unsurprisingly, shows comment-topic and new-given as unmarked, typical or-
ders. Several verb-initial or predicate initial languages, some rather well-studied, have
been described as having a comment-topic order as the unmarked information structure
of the sentence (Van Valin, van Valin Jr, van Valin Jr, LaPolla, and LaPolla, 1997), includ-
ing Tagalog (LaPolla, 2019, Nagaya, 2007, Naylor, 1975, p. 48), Uto-Aztecan languages

including Tohono O’odham (Payne, 1987, p. 798) and Ute (Givón, 1983, p. 33, 145), and
Biblical Hebrew (Givón, 1983, Kaajan, 2019, p. 28). Numerous languages previously de-
scribed as “free word order” languages also show a tendency for an order of new-given in
opposition to given-new (Mithun, 1992, Tomlin and Rhodes, 1992).
",37.91100311279297,4,0.7531973580097047,"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",51.89512252807617,1,0.7334091962883393,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",47.876068115234375,5,0.8292170128182149," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-

",48.25968170166016,5,0.8645426485395201,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",49.403594970703125,0,0.7718484278131795,"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.
",58.53359603881836,5,0.7493538813851758," Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",60.97253036499024,5,0.7898159801988297,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",60.033164978027344,5,0.794859001682593,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",65.6764144897461,5,0.8540152665404503,"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 ‘He put mud on my eyes’
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",67.93972778320312,1,0.8379985649028171," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

",51.646583557128906,3,0.7338267565135845," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",48.16426467895508,4,0.8062518872007994,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",47.71653747558594,1,0.8146391785829595,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).

tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the

clear when they are.
",63.38764953613281,5,0.8124349522229201," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",53.80262756347656,5,0.7698146304635254,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or

Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",69.90715789794922,1,0.7510772444708212,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

"First, as thousands of examples in this dissertation can attest, Enxet Sur is predicate-
initial and therefore verb-initial language. When a declarative (non-nominalized) verb
serves as the predicate of the simple clause, it always appears in the initial position, as
in (5.53), unless an element has been fronted for the sake of focus, as described in §5.2.4.
This focus position requires the use of the second position declarative verb form (§3.4.1),
serving as an indication that any non-verb-initial word order is marked. Therefore, while
the ordering of s-argument noun phrases which occur after the verb is pragmatically
based, it is not at all accurate to represent Enxet Sur as a ‘free word order’ language.

The marked nature of non-initial declarative verbs is rather limited, however. As de-
scribed in §3.4.1, verb bases ending in the glottal stop and a number of stem-forming
morphemes have phonological properties which result in homophony between the initial
and second position declaratives. Furthermore, any non-declarative verb form is gram-
matically and semantically a nominalization, and these nominalized verb forms are gen-
erally more common in discourse than declarative forms. Declarative verbs, however, are
used with more foregrounded, salient events in discourse.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two

a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”

 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

somewhat unsurprisingly, shows comment-topic and new-given as unmarked, typical or-
ders. Several verb-initial or predicate initial languages, some rather well-studied, have
been described as having a comment-topic order as the unmarked information structure
of the sentence (Van Valin, van Valin Jr, van Valin Jr, LaPolla, and LaPolla, 1997), includ-

Biblical Hebrew (Givón, 1983, Kaajan, 2019, p. 28). Numerous languages previously de-

",53.116798400878906,4,0.7888967343830933," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-

semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-

indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.
",60.62190628051758,3,0.7528838278406963,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.
",63.79309844970703,5,0.7741723620095203," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.
",67.04470825195312,1,0.8275137087916221," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",4,0.8194622763540024,"Enxet Sur is a predicate-initial language with an otherwise pragmatically determined
word order. Nominal predicates play an important role in the basic grammar of the lan-
guage, as nominal expressions which reference the semantic arguments of verbs are of-
ten realized syntactically as the nominal predicates of independent clauses, instead of
as nominal dependents of the verb. Furthemore, a highly productive process of gram-
matical deverbal nominalization is used for most complex sentence types. Thus, Enxet
Sur presents some interesting deviations from cross-linguistic tendencies regarding the
syntactic and functional behaviors of noun and verb word classes.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",47.08253860473633,1,0.8246218115087461," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",52.14097595214844,1,0.7529290394656029,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

The other order, [D Pro R], appears just as often and is equally common in discourse. It
is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-
icates as in (13.38b-13.38d), and as the argument of a participial verb (13.38e-13.38f). I
have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other
language where constituent order in NPs is dependent upon semantic or even grammati-
cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",60.59528732299805,3,0.7572589739339802," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.
",63.700950622558594,1,0.7663673885946833,"For example, in (15.39a), ko’o ‘I’ is the agent of the nominalized clause wáxñeksek
exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other
examples of this kind of pronominal raising are given in (15.39)

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",66.84271240234375,1,0.8187643367041084,"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.
",69.49230194091797,3,0.7719147480392538,"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame
=demonstrative.

" Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",4,0.8282905659959784,"First, (13.37) provides some examples of the [R D Pro] order. If we consider the D
noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",66.62663269042969,5,0.8463107495734221," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which
have a parallel function to subordinate clauses (§15.1). For example, in (5.60a), the utter-
ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’
has a VOA order. In this case, eyaqtenek ‘cutting it down’ is entirely new in the discourse

",50.84111022949219,4,0.7652101913820739," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",52.81980514526367,4,0.8077236880601805," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",46.83013534545898,1,0.8127074761947005,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",51.918487548828125,5,0.8509021926169695," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants

the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-

tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",59.04834747314453,5,0.7658527890214155,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,

which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-

other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment

paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",50.72518539428711,5,0.7802553912800303,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",46.89607620239258,4,0.8021731825656482,"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",52.21928405761719,0,0.7942428770810999,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.
",51.45809555053711,5,0.8645172033448631,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",61.70824813842773,5,0.8249056921408171," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",55.43147277832031,1,0.808926541292821," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",40.16604232788086,1,0.7652503823754307,"For example, in (15.39a), ko’o ‘I’ is the agent of the nominalized clause wáxñeksek
exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other
examples of this kind of pronominal raising are given in (15.39)

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

",51.90973281860352,3,0.7724886120801873," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",69.28411102294922,3,0.7683124027626176,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",69.65309143066406,0,0.7894040351400912
"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",1,0.8220507890430218," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",38.35820388793945,1,0.8110405692477956,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,

which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed

This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",57.49309539794922,1,0.6872548866198066,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.
",59.22026824951172,1,0.8167489513978522," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",50.022552490234375,0,0.7717665940864439," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",46.69272994995117,1,0.7988856860705169,"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame
=demonstrative.
",52.169471740722656,1,0.7910416584325479," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.
",45.81834411621094,4,0.8397220543616228," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.

ing of epistemic clitics appears somewhat predictable, since any combination of multiple
epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed
as a single linear order of all of the epistemic clitics.

non-core s-arguments. These include:

we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-

a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",51.70859146118164,3,0.7804035803035333,"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases

word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",1,0.8186221684585412," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",59.1090202331543,3,0.8240229860821525,"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 ‘Your child has no parasites?’ (literally ‘There are no parasites in your child’s in-
sides?’)
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",64.69232177734375,1,0.8284473526734774,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",65.41010284423828,5,0.8733378352369678,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",35.89983367919922,5,0.8077615535476845,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",49.83695983886719,0,0.763550204246934,"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple

=demonstrative.
",46.66129684448242,1,0.7957036860551993," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the

cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",54.81928634643555,5,0.8451322487190318," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there

ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

",59.51608276367188,0,0.7598168052692095,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.
",59.91332626342773,5,0.7915233137692116,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",62.62764739990234,0,0.7577703398661747," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",69.02692413330078,1,0.7625678620371817,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

Kalisch (2019:144) even provides the data in (5.58) which shows that in closely re-
lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",35.46581268310547,5,0.8297290071396075," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

",45.98386001586914,0,0.7915341751794207," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",59.75971984863281,1,0.792615737778072," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred

Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

" Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

lated Enlhet Norte, NP order has no disambiguating function for equal-animacy/gender
contexts.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",50.40473937988281,0,0.8634643357411752,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.
",58.32221603393555,3,0.7607123059108635," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.
",59.42070388793945,3,0.7726305184593903," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

",65.15850067138672,2,0.8295651758660738,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles

ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

Even in constructions with equal animacy arguments of the same grammatical gender,
relative order is not ﬁxed. For example, (5.57a) has a VOA order despite having two
masculine-gendered human arguments. There is, however, a diﬀerence between enxet as
a set noun and Tamayásek as a single deﬁnite referent. In (5.57b), however, both NPs are
deﬁnite entities.

So why, then, is there a strong VAO eﬀect in this de-contextualized equal-animacy en-
vironment? I would argue that, rather than being the result of a syntactic reﬂection of
assigned grammatical labels, the VAO order of (5.54) is an emergent eﬀect of the prag-
matically based word order of the language, coupled with the syntactic constituency of
the nominal complement being distinguished from the appositive nature of subsequent
nominal expressions.

13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-

indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls

right of the other categories of clitics, but they are not mutually exclusive of one another
like the evidential or tense clitics, and so multiple can occur on a given host. The order-

epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed
as a single linear order of all of the epistemic clitics.
",44.044830322265625,1,0.8142039149191604," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’

one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make

cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-

but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns

13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",65.08269500732422,1,0.8304319643277613,"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

",1,0.8735105561780893,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

 5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
overt nominal or pronominal arguments within the clause. This lack of pronouns or NPs
to refer to verbal arguments is sometimes referred to as zero anaphora, which, along
with “free word order”, is a deﬁning characteristic of languages which have been referred
to as “non-conﬁgurational” (cf. Hale 1983). In some theoretical frameworks, especially
Government and Binding theory, zero anaphora is largely synonymous with “pro-drop”,
which is a term that more or less exclusively refers to languages which can drop or express
as null their subject pronouns, and languages like Spanish and Italian are viewed as hav-
ing abundant pro-drop because of their rich verbal subject agreement. Zero anaphora
in non-conﬁgurational languages can occur with nominal expressions regardless of their
semantic role or grammatical label, and regardless of whether or not an overt verbal mor-
pheme indicates the referent of the zero-marked nominal expression.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate

this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.
",49.63116455078125,1,0.8648398151911979," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",59.36944961547852,1,0.8422981047181206,"For example, in (15.39a), ko’o ‘I’ is the agent of the nominalized clause wáxñeksek
exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other
examples of this kind of pronominal raising are given in (15.39)

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",52.64690017700195,1,0.8380621054598696," Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",39.141021728515625,5,0.7794091299363655,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",44.93001174926758,5,0.8308915462774761,"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 mud =tc:hod 1sg.pat.dist-cover-val-val-compl-scnd 1sg.poss-eye-pl
 ‘He put mud on my eyes’
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",62.17864608764648,3,0.7676169259348936," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.
",48.473052978515625,1,0.8113527048118633,"As discussed in §5.1, Grubb (1911) presents a basic fact which must be the basis for a
description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”
",56.94229507446289,5,0.8260959956367799,"Following an initial verb, there are a series of dependent elements whose order is gen-
erally quite ﬁxed. The verbal predicate (as with non-verbal predicates) is followed im-
mediately by tame clitics, which have their own relative ordering template which applies
whenever multiple are used on a single predicate (§6.1). After tame clitics, three other
clausal constituents can occur: independent pronouns (§4.5.1), lexical adverbs (§9.3), and
the “coordinating” han clitic (§16.2). Pronouns are ordered based on a person hierarchy
(§5.2.3), but the relative order of these three components is not rigid, and is possibly
manipulable for semantic eﬀect, although more study is needed on the order of these ele-
ments. After these post-predicate items, the nominal complement is the second possible
position for lexical content in the clause, followed by a demonstrative. As described in
Ch. 7, the demonstrative functions as a clausal boundary clitic, marking the right edge of
the clause.
",59.35773086547852,1,0.7797973997746066," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and

 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).

 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",59.29368209838867,5,0.8628587316638348,"First, (13.37) provides some examples of the [R D Pro] order. If we consider the D
noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-

have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other
language where constituent order in NPs is dependent upon semantic or even grammati-
cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new

brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment

paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,

which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",51.83757400512695,0,0.7579814844492695," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.
",57.25434494018555,1,0.7943211651261652," When a dyadic verb is followed by two s-arguments NPs of inequal animacy, like a
human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made

NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think

a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",55.97399520874024,3,0.7856341604792023,"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-

this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",63.100345611572266,0,0.8688288692774812,"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",34.039306640625,1,0.8339554505499225,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",46.73762512207031,0,0.7808771788383397," This pragmatically based word order eﬀect applies equally to nominalized verbs which

ance mopmenyek indigena eyaqtenek mémog ‘the Indigenous don’t like cutting down Palo
Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down

cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",48.83939743041992,3,0.8956074915403655,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",52.19475555419922,5,0.8591667742782821," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

human and an animal, VAO and VOA orders are equally grammatical to consultants in
de-contextualized grammaticality judgements, and the relative order of argument NPs
does not aﬀect the reading of the phrase. In (5.55a) and (5.55b), the diﬀerent orders of
the argument NPs have no bearing on the meaning of the clause. In this instance, semheg
‘dog’ is feminine, and the masculine nominative marking on the verb clearly indicates that
‘Juan’ and not ‘dog’ is the agent. However, when semheg is replaced with a masculine noun
yátnáxeg ‘horse’, where the verbal pronominal marking does not clearly indicate which
NP is the agent, there are still no constraints on the relative ordering of the argument
NPs. Therefore, in such examples, relative word order does not indicate thematic role, nor
is there a syntactic animacy hierarchy15 , since such a hierarchy would place the higher
animacy argument in a privileged syntactic position and their would either be a strong
preference for one of the two orders or ungrammaticality of one of them.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-

diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak
 ko’o ahagkok xapop // ø-yaqwat-akx-oho kel-h-eykha=eyke

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak
 =just 2plinside =tc:vis
 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

 ap-tem-akxaamyep yohoxma apagkok
 m.part-be.ti-nm:ob garden shaman poss.m
 ‘Customs of the yohoxma’s garden’
LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",64.48421478271484,1,0.8230498582500737,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",68.39471435546875,4,0.8396649146880403,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",68.72032928466797,5,0.8196494648996304
"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",0,0.8899607439183401," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.
",37.58771896362305,1,0.853735381898212,"Constituent order becomes more marked from there on out. In inalienable possession,
the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

sides?’)
 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",48.22502899169922,1,0.8228891407973877,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",56.67973709106445,0,0.8229617227081794,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",55.70415878295898,5,0.8059318475908196,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",58.0742301940918,1,0.8655046135104996,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",62.99884414672852,5,0.88872586498431," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",64.4481430053711,1,0.9070948361257238," Three of his publications25 with linguistic analysis are highly salient to the present
work. Unruh and Kalisch (2003) is the designation of the languages of the family and
some comparison between them, and is the source of the “Enlhet-Enenlhet” family name.
(Hannes Kalisch, 2019) describes the pragmatically-based word order of Enlhet Norte —
Kalisch’s ﬁndings are very similar to those presented for Enxet Sur in this dissertation in
§5.2.2.
",33.18528366088867,5,0.8540204074088674," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.
",46.59007263183594,0,0.7771162332412519," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",40.26510620117188,0,0.8473021731635939,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",44.38742446899414,3,0.870784760310359," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",48.62991714477539,1,0.89611027809336,"First, to establish some terminology, take the example in (13.47).

[[Carlos ap-yap] silla apagkok]
[[Carlos m.poss-father chair m.poss]
‘Carlos’ father’s chair’
 Skype 1.27.2020
Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.
",44.24918365478516,5,0.8624153371598055,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",50.50730895996094,4,0.8289689829391644," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

ing of epistemic clitics appears somewhat predictable, since any combination of multiple
epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed
as a single linear order of all of the epistemic clitics.

brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",37.533836364746094,1,0.8544309757125285," Although coordinating structures with the order [A B co] are not particularly com-
mon among the world’s languages, it is generally accepted that in most monosyndetic
languages which have an [A co B] order, there is some asymmetry between coordinated
phrases in terms of the coordinator being constituent with one rather than the other
(Haspelmath, 2004, p. 6-7). The implication, then, is that the more obvious asymme-
try of an [A B co] order is not necessarily so diﬀerent from an [A co B] order. Nonetheless,
any [A B co] order more seriously raises the question of whether or not the two clauses are
really coordinated, and the answer to such a question largely depends on the theoretical
leaning of a given analysis.
",48.0865478515625,1,0.8237314307490416,"In what little previous description exists on Enxet Sur and related EE languages, two
facts have always been clear regarding the basic syntax of such verbal clauses: 1) Enxet
Sur and EE languages are unambiguously verb-initial, and 2) Enxet Sur and EE languages
have an especially strong preference (beyond cross-linguistic trends) for no more than one
non-pronimal argument NP, going so far as to prefer rendering two NPs as arguments
of diﬀerent verbs rather than have two overt NPs as arguments of a single verb. Both
these traits are apparent in the description by Grubb (1911, p. 319–21)1 , the ﬁrst non-
indigenous person to learn to speak Enxet [presumably to a high degree of competency]
and make any description of its syntax:
Sentences are very simple. The verb precedes the noun, whether subject or
object. With neuter verbs the subject is expressed, with active verbs the object;
and sometimes the subject is expressed when there is a necessity.
",56.38923645019531,4,0.8380708324998104," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",59.20274353027344,1,0.8166363735856991," Aside from a lack of case markers, determiners, or word order constraints which expli-
cate grammatical roles of NPs, Enxet Sur lacks subordinating conjunctions, complemen-
tizers, or relative pronouns (§15.1), true adpositions have very limited operability and
most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",62.51436614990234,1,0.8892550537998613,"First, (13.37) provides some examples of the [R D Pro] order. If we consider the D
noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

The other order, [D Pro R], appears just as often and is equally common in discourse. It
is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-
icates as in (13.38b-13.38d), and as the argument of a participial verb (13.38e-13.38f). I
have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other
language where constituent order in NPs is dependent upon semantic or even grammati-
cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

Santo’ has a VAO order, with the nominalized verb phrase eyaqtenek mémog ‘cutting down
Palo Santo’ as the O. The speaker has already talked extensively up to this point about cut-
ting down Palo Santo, but is actively contrasting the behaviors of the indigena ‘Indigenous
people’ with those of the non-Indigenous. Thus, indígena is newer and foregrounded and
eyaqtenek mémog is more given and backgrounded, yielding the VAO order. In (5.60b), a
comparable utterance mopmenyek eyaqtenek énxet ‘The Enxet don’t like cutting it down’

Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,

It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.

 Figure 6.1: The tame clitic ordering template and possible clitics for each region

right of the other categories of clitics, but they are not mutually exclusive of one another
like the evidential or tense clitics, and so multiple can occur on a given host. The order-
ing of epistemic clitics appears somewhat predictable, since any combination of multiple
epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed
as a single linear order of all of the epistemic clitics.
",49.18905258178711,1,0.8297823588537755," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",50.68804168701172,0,0.8584534571341426,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",50.4649772644043,5,0.8094030991678214,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

" An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.
",1,0.8909985073773536,"The precise nature of these features of Enxet Sur clausal structure may be in some
ways unique to Enxet Sur or the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family, but they are similar
in a number of ways to syntactic descriptions and analyses of various so-called “polysyn-
thetic” or “non-conﬁgurational” languages. Because these topics related to clausal struc-
ture are both complex and relevant to essentially every component of the syntactic de-
scription of the language, this chapter begins with an extended overview which describes
the features of the Enxet Sur clause and the grammatical relationship between verbs and
nouns, and places them within a broader typological and theoretical context. §5.2 de-
scribes a number of features of indicative clauses, including non-verbal predicates, word
order, alignment, and constituent focus constructions. §5.3 then describes the structure
of interrogative clauses, which at least in the case of content questions, are structurally
very diﬀerent from comparable indicative clauses.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",47.71539688110352,1,0.8245594463267033," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.
",56.32087707519531,1,0.8388314892279934,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",64.09073638916016,0,0.9032735447603122,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",32.10918426513672,5,0.874186981950958,"This principle of pragmatically based word order is broadly applicable beyond the
core arguments of dyadic verbs. With triadic verbs, those that have three core s-arguments,
there does not appear to be any tendency regarding word order except that the inanimate
patient appears more likely to be ﬁrst after the verb, although in all observed examples
this is always a result of newness versus givenness in the discourse. For example in (5.61a)
and (5.61b), the order of the nominal expressions referencing the animate ‘giver’ and ‘re-
ceiver’ are the reverse of each other.

This ordering principle even extends to nominal expressions which are not even refer-
encing core s-arguments of a verb. As described in chapter 9 on adverbial modiﬁcation,
most of the semantic space covered by adverbs and adverbial phrases in languages like
English is realized in Enxet Sur through nominal expressions. These nominal expres-
sions that might denote temporal or spatial qualities of a propositoin are syntactically
related to verbal predicates in the same way that s-argument nominal expressions are —
either as roleless nominal complements or paratactic predicates. Therefore, in (5.62), we
see aptetchek awhak yámet, xápen apwa’ ‘they tied the rhea feathers to the roots of trees’,
where a semantically oblique element awhak yámet ‘the roots of trees’ comes before the
nominal expression of a core s-argument xápen apwa’ ‘rhea feathers’. Again, ‘rhea feath-
ers’ is topicalized in the discourse, and ‘the roots of trees’ is new information.

As was mentioned above, however, Enxet Sur does not have a fully pragmatically
based word order. As shown in table 5.1, not all logically possible orders of V, A, and O
are grammatical from a base construction like (5.63), since it is not possible to put two s-
argument nominal expressions before the verb, and any non-verb-initial clause is marked
with a second-position declarative verb (§5.2.4).

 The only way that two s-argument nouns can occur ahead of a verb is if they are in
clear topic clauses, as in (5.64). Here, both s-arguments of the verb kotwok ‘eat’ come be-
fore the verb, but both are marked with nak as structurally independent predicates. This
particular example is the ﬁrst line of a piece of text, and therefore the two initial nomi-
nal predicates serve to posit discourse referents which are then activated and referenced
anaphorically by the verb.

5.2.3Verbal alignment
Alignment refers to the morphosyntactic indication of grammatical relations, or how se-
mantic roles are instantiated as morphosyntactic categories. Traditional alignment typol-
ogy primarily concerns the relative arrangement and identity of core arguments, specif-
ically the agents of transitive verbs (A), the single arguments of intransitive verbs (S),
and the objects or patients of transitive verbs (P). The typology may be extended to in-
clude arguments in ditransitives, in which case an additional goal argument (R) can be
discussed17 .
",45.84930419921875,5,0.8169416066657268," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.
",38.93840789794922,0,0.8487781591259803," Three of his publications25 with linguistic analysis are highly salient to the present
work. Unruh and Kalisch (2003) is the designation of the languages of the family and

for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

However, a minority of such noun-noun compounds display the opposite order, as in
(13.56), where the latter noun is a descriptor of the ﬁrst. For example, náta semheg is

animal names, but their order is that used in more productive uses of nouns as modiﬁers

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",38.10663986206055,3,0.8227771950748378," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

",48.935359954833984,0,0.8258844845922471," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak
 ko’o ahagkok xapop // ø-yaqwat-akx-oho kel-h-eykha=eyke

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak
 =just 2plinside =tc:vis
 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

 ap-tem-akxaamyep yohoxma apagkok
 m.part-be.ti-nm:ob garden shaman poss.m
 ‘Customs of the yohoxma’s garden’
LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",56.516639709472656,1,0.8362485729511736,"For example, in (15.39a), ko’o ‘I’ is the agent of the nominalized clause wáxñeksek
exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other
examples of this kind of pronominal raising are given in (15.39)

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",57.8641242980957,1,0.8336652300251042," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even

lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",57.28711318969727,5,0.8859569140888435," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

",63.56798553466797,0,0.8990811050538918," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function

one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.

words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",48.051361083984375,1,0.8975676908827277," Finally, probably most importantly, he states that “Lengua” is a verb initial language
in which transitive verbs are usually followed by their object and intransitive verbs by
their subject, and that it is rare to have sentences with expressed subject and object. Fur-
thermore, where two participants with diﬀerent thematic roles are explicitly referenced,
this is typically accomplished using two verbs rather than onee. A sentence like ’the tiger
killed the man’, he says, is typically given as ""apmatneyi enlhit, niptana apkyakhe"" (Grubb’s
spellling), literally ’the man died, the tiger’s killing’ (pg. 319). This is probably the most
morphology with relatively little space aﬀorded to syntax, but this is generally reﬂective of the relative
importance of the two levels of form in the actual languages.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

",49.96073532104492,1,0.8111788995329265,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",56.26615905761719,0,0.8323672219008579,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed
as a single linear order of all of the epistemic clitics.
",57.815914154052734,1,0.855264817364204," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",64.01866912841797,3,0.8499745661401813," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

description of grammatical relations in Enxet Sur — that truly disambiguating the seman-
tic roles of multiple NPs requires multiple verbs. This conforms to observations about
other EE languages made in Kalisch (2009). However, Powys (1929)[p. 3; 97–98] presents
a diﬀerent view of basic word order: “A normal type of Lengua sentence is therefore: 1. Verb
with subject denoted by preﬁx or understood, 2. Tense particle, 3. Direct Object, 4. Indirect
object”. As for those instances where there are two overt NP arguments of a verb, Powys
further states that the typical order is VOA when the direct object is “not referring to a
person”, but VAO if “the object is a person, proper name, with the possibility of confusion
arising.”

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",63.53286361694336,1,0.8995440538597997," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This

 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.
",38.857364654541016,1,0.868650894452979,"Consider the data in (5.59). All of these examples include the semiverb -menye- ‘to
want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized

as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.
",42.50817489624024,5,0.8792495497425875,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",43.37656021118164,1,0.8731818893139944,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",47.78016662597656,0,0.8934502469596893,"In general, the more common pattern is that the ﬁrst noun is a descriptor of second,
as in the examples in (13.55). For example, yaqtépa yámet ‘squash tree/plant’ is a kind of
yámet ‘tree’ and not a kind of yaqtépa ‘squash’.

However, a minority of such noun-noun compounds display the opposite order, as in
(13.56), where the latter noun is a descriptor of the ﬁrst. For example, náta semheg is
a kind of náta bird and not a kind of semheg ‘dog’. These examples present plant and
animal names, but their order is that used in more productive uses of nouns as modiﬁers
of other nouns, described in §15.1.1

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.
",56.97407150268555,1,0.8899446286274951," Any of these explanations about observed [D R] orders require further investigation,
but for now we can say that [R D] orders are typical, and [D R] orders only arise in certain
pragmatic contexts, and in cases where the syntactic constituency of the D and R nouns
is questionable.
13.4.2 Possessive pronouns in the NP
The primary possession strategy for non-related nouns is the use of the possessive pro-
nouns, which have a base form of -agkok along with a pronominal preﬁx9 which generally
corresponds to the possessive pronominal preﬁxes of related nouns (§4.4). The form of
these possessive pronouns is described more fully in §4.5.2. This section describes their
use within the noun phrase.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).
(13.36)aptemakxa amyep yohoxma apagkok
 ap-tem-akxaamyep yohoxma apagkok
 m.part-be.ti-nm:ob garden shaman poss.m
 ‘Customs of the yohoxma’s garden’
LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",37.68224334716797,1,0.8244089612989872,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",43.713905334472656,5,0.8834223642098957,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

epistemic clitics always occurs in the same order, but this ordering cannot be expressed

",49.874053955078125,5,0.8303944262948706," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",55.98676681518555,0,0.8285488743886147,"This ﬁrst implication of a lack of clear argument role assignment holds up to scrutiny
in the modern language. Nouns have no morphological markers of dependency on verbs
or other predicate types — no case morphology, no determiners. Furthermore, aside
from the predicate-initial nature of the language, the word order of verbal arguments
is pragmatically based, meaning that the order of NPs relative to a verb is not based
on their semantic role relative to the verb, but instead based on information structure
factors. A fuller description of word order is given in §5.2.2. Kalisch (2009) has made
similar claims about a lack of morphosyntactic means of disambiguating argument roles
in closely related Enlhet Norte.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.

It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and

which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

",49.057899475097656,1,0.8564494269369252," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",49.77117919921875,0,0.8266284302462935,"Syntactically, they have a ﬁxed position in the clause, immediately after the ﬁrst lex-
ical word or complex phrase, which is typically the predicate but can be the nominal
complement in the case of the constituent focus construction (§5.2.4), which places the
declarative verb after instead of before the tame clitics, as in (6.2). In this way they behave
like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

 Rojas and Curtis (2017)
Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.
",55.88685989379883,1,0.8293264377261451," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",57.66004180908203,5,0.8747229143470734,"First, to establish some terminology, take the example in (13.47).
(13.47)Carlos apyáp silla apagkok
[[Carlos ap-yap] silla apagkok]
[[Carlos m.poss-father chair m.poss]
‘Carlos’ father’s chair’
 Skype 1.27.2020
Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.
",61.21896362304688,1,0.8189637793250948,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.
",1,0.892974076962794,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other

",62.564544677734375,1,0.9004481251563412," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic
one (§8.1), but -menye- is, semantically, one of the most reliably dyadic predicates in the
language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,
as in (5.59c), which can give an AVO or OVA order. In such cases, the “left dislocated”

 When both s-arguments are expressed as post-verbal nominal expressions, we can
clearly see the eﬀect of the pragmatically based word order. In (5.59d), the utterance
amenyeyk waley palo azul ‘Paraguayans want Palo Azul’ has a VAO order because the O
palo azul has been the primary topic of discourse for several lines prior — it is given, and
the A waley is new. In (5.59e), the utterance apmenyek agkok pomap énxet ‘If an Enxet wants
boar’16 has a VOA order because the O pomap boar is more central to the proposition and
the A énxet is more topicalized in the discourse.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function

 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha
tetet yámet ek-tem-e xáma panaqte neg-m-a-wán-a

ag-máha
1pl.irr-have-amb.nm:po
‘The Ibis Tree (Spanish yerba de lucero is a medicine we can use’
 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-
icates as in (13.38b-13.38d), and as the argument of a participial verb (13.38e-13.38f). I
have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other

cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",56.86441802978516,1,0.890935091672353,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.
",50.15580749511719,1,0.8960244109246959,"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak
 ko’o ahagkok xapop // ø-yaqwat-akx-oho kel-h-eykha=eyke

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak
 =just 2plinside =tc:vis
 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).
(13.36)aptemakxa amyep yohoxma apagkok
 ap-tem-akxaamyep yohoxma apagkok
 m.part-be.ti-nm:ob garden shaman poss.m
 ‘Customs of the yohoxma’s garden’
LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",42.791786193847656,1,0.8799566756349732,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between

non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",53.94650268554688,0,0.8261218417452935," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.
",55.56563186645508,3,0.8923471814320536,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",61.15398406982422,0,0.8924074985755943,"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame

the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-

this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).

However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?
",42.92271041870117,5,0.888130501545137," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",47.04327392578125,0,0.8904414294927641,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",56.634857177734375,0,0.886982772083674,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",50.09031295776367,1,0.896485661986965,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.
",37.40104675292969,5,0.8355459969401351," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.
",42.394134521484375,3,0.8893615007878446,"Furthermore, I attempt to only really provide “explanations” for forms and patterns
to the degree that I believe that such explanations will make it easier for the reader to
understand the relevant patterns from a descriptive perspective. For example, in §3.4.3,
instead of simply describing the allomorphy of the perfective and imperfective suﬃxes,
which display a great degree of homophony across various forms, I provide what I think
to be a fairly uncontroversial and well-evidenced diachronic explanation for the observed
forms so that they seem less arbitrary and the morphological analyses will be more credi-
ble.
1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.

for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-

some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-

However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

1.4 A Grammatical Overview
This section attempts to provide a brief outline of the basics of word class, morphology,
and clausal syntax in Enxet Sur, so that readers here for information on a particular fea-
ture can get a general idea of the language’s structure.
1.4.1 Word Classes
Word classes in Enxet Sur are deﬁned in this dissertation primarily on the basis of mor-
phological selection and inﬂection (which formatives a lexical root can and must take in
order to form a grammatical word), and secondarily by the syntactic distributions they
occur in. This yields two major open word classes, verbs and nouns, and a number of
small, arguably closed word classes with relatively few members, the most important be-
ing adjectives, adverbs, and semiverbs. As in probably any natural language, there are
some lexical items which do not ﬁt cleanly into any single word class.
Verbs
Verbs, in many ways, play double duty in Enxet Sur, acting not only in their relational
capacity as ﬁnite predicates, but also in making up a large portion of the referential nouns
in the language through deverbal nominalization. The verb has three major structural
components: 1) a pronominal preﬁx, 2) the typically multi-morphemic verb stem, and
3) a grammatical suﬃx which identiﬁes the grammatical category of the verb, either as a
ﬁnite declarative, an imperative, or one of several types of grammatical nominalization.
This basic three-part structure can be seen in the verb agyetmok ‘we pour it’ in (1.4).

1.4. A Grammatical Overview
 Pronominal Preﬁxes: Since the arguments of verbs are often not indicated by overt
nominal expressions, the pronominal preﬁx is often the primary or sole indicator of the se-
mantic argument structure of a clause. Five pronominal categories are represented: ﬁrst
person singular and plural, non-ﬁrst person masculine and feminine, and a ﬁfth category
which alternately marks either the second person plural or a kind of impersonal/passive
structure. The masculine and feminine categories do not distinguish between second
and third person. The pronominal preﬁx indicates the nominative argument (subject of
monadic29 verbs/agent of dyadic verbs), unless one of the arguments is the ﬁrst person,
in which case the pronominal preﬁx is ﬁrst person regardless of the thematic/semantic
role of the ﬁrst person argument. A paradigm of patient ﬁrst person preﬁxes is used if
the ﬁrst person argument is not the agent of a polyadic verb. Pronominal preﬁxes also ex-
ist in three diﬀerent paradigms which additionally indicate the grammatical category of
the verb — realis preﬁxes for declarative verbs, irrealis for potential/imperative/negated
verbs, and participial for most deverbal nominalizations.
",55.497802734375,0,0.8884306286671603,"For example, in (15.39a), ko’o ‘I’ is the agent of the nominalized clause wáxñeksek
exagkok ‘the cleaning of my house’, which serves as the subject of the grammaticalized
verb peyk ‘start, is about to start’ (see §3.3.4). However, ko’o occurs to the immediate
right of the predicate peyk, despite the fact that it is an s-argument of the dependent
verb wáxñeksek. If wáxñeksek was the predicate of a dependent clause that had the same
internal structure as an independent clause, the pronoun would be to its right. Other
examples of this kind of pronominal raising are given in (15.39)

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.
",61.07439422607422,1,0.8928797270060795," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in

not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",48.03731155395508,1,0.8937996817112217," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.
",49.64333724975586,0,0.8423180902486881," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and

 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,

like Wackernagel or Second Position clitics.

Another deﬁning syntactic feature of tame clitics is the templatic structure which gov-
erns their relative ordering. The term “template” is sometimes controversial, but here it is
employed simply as a shorthand to refer to the fact that when multiple tame clitics apply
to a single host, the order in which they occur is pre-determined and — for most clitics in
the set — invariable. The order of clitics cannot be changed for semantic eﬀects, meaning
there is no manipulation of semantic scope which can be achieved through variations in
the order of these clitics. However, the existence of obligatory ordering restrictions or
a “template”, does not indicate that slots in the “template” are always extant and that
null markers can ﬁll a slot for particular semantic eﬀect. For example, although there
are three mutually exclusive evidential particles forming an evidential “slot” in the tame
clitic template, marking visual, reportative, and conjectural evidentiality, respectively, ev-
identiality marking is non-obligatory and the absence of one of the three markers does
not indicate a fourth null-marked evidentiality value which contrasts with the other three.
The tame clitic template is presented in ﬁgure 6.1.

most are recent innovations (§9.2), and there is essentially no evidence other than seman-
tics to posit a grammatical oblique position which might distinguish core from non-core
NP arguments. There are, then, in the whole language, extremely few explicit, overt in-
dications of constituency or dependency. Thus, it is clear when the nouns denoting the
semantic arguments of verbs are not part of the clause headed by the verb, but not so
clear when they are.

One interpretation of this phenomenon might be that these “raised” pronouns are
possessors of the nominalization — a [possessor possessed] order is the typical order for
noun phrases with an related noun and an overt possessor (13.4.1). There is also the cross-
linguistic tendency for participants or arguments of nominalized verbs to be rendered as
possessors of the verb.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

The other order, [D Pro R], appears just as often and is equally common in discourse. It
is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-

have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other

In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex

without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-

that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.

‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-

one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.3 The syntactic and pragmatic function of NPs
In the previous section, the Enxet Sur verb is argued to be grammatically whole on its
own, and co-occurring nominal expressions that identify verbal s-arguments are argued
to be 1) often clearly separated and in an appositive relationship with verbs and 2) there-
fore not ordered or assigned a particular grammatical role by the verb. A number of
diﬀerent approaches have attempted to account for this lack of syntactic cohesiveness of
semantically constituent verbs and nouns in many diﬀerent languages, most proposing
in one way or another that the verb in and of itself fulﬁlls grammatical requirements of
argument structure and grammatical labeling — either by doing so through pronominal
aﬃxes or because such structural labeling is not part of the grammar in the ﬁrst place.
These approaches and explanations are verb-centric, but we can ask the question from
the other side as well: if nouns that refer to verbal s-arguments are not g-arguments of
those verbs, then, grammatically, what are they?

",56.22684860229492,0,0.885630357312166,"This diﬀers substantially from traditional information structure analyses, because the
only component of the topic that is grammatically part of the same clause as the comment
is the topical demonstrative, which does not contain any lexical content. In Enxet Sur,
to have a nominal or other lexical expression establishing or referring to topics, they are
paratactic nominal predicates which constitute a distinct grammatical clause. In light of
the fact that any lexical comment-topic pairing in Enxet Sur inherently involves multiple
clauses, and given that there often is no overt lexical topic at all (only a topical demon-
strative), we might also view Enxet Sur as a language with a predominantly unipartite
information structure (cf. Izre’el 2018).
5.2 Indicative Clauses
An indicative clause is canonically one which asserts a proposition12 . Quite often in
syntactic description, the central object of focus in the description of simple indicative
clauses is the transitive or dyadic verbal clause, as it is in such a syntactic environment
that a language shows its morphosyntactic mechanisms for establishing grammatical re-
lations or the assignment of roles to its arguments. Other types of indicative clauses,
not just intransitives but also nonverbal predicates, are often presented as somehow sec-
ondary. This description, in contrast, begins with a description of nonverbal predicates
and the use of nonverbal predicates in discourse in §5.2.1, since nonverbal predicates
have a broader range of functional use than clauses headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.2
describes the pragmatically based word order of the language, with a focus on clauses
headed by declarative verbs. §5.2.3 relates the Enxet Sur data to conventional alignment
typology. Finally, §5.2.4 describes the structure and function of the dependent-focus con-
struction.
5.2.1Nonverbal predicates
Cross-linguistically, nonverbal predicates, or clauses in which the primary propositional
value is not a semantically contentful verb, have a range of functions. Overall, Vallejos,
 12 In the linguistic literature of other languages, the term ‘declarative’ may also be used, but ‘indicative’ is
used here since the term ‘declarative’ is already being employed as a label for the inﬂectional suﬃx which
is used to assert non-future propositions.

non-core s-arguments. These include:

want, to like’. Its identity as a semiverb is more a morphological issues than a syntactic

language, and I refer to it here simply as an instance of V. Most of the time, it occurs fol-
lowed by only a single s-argument NP, since the other s-argument is already a topicalized
referent in the discourse. Therefore, if its agent is topicalized, there is a VO expression
as in (5.59a), and if its patient is topicalized, there is a VA expression as in (5.59b). Of-
tentimes, one of the s-arguments is introduced via a bare paratactic nominal expression,

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",46.12481689453125,1,0.8443735897530731," In (13.33d), the NP is actually part of a complex predicate máxa eyáxeg ko’o ‘is like my
brother’, and possessive NPs in predicate positions often present some complicated prob-
lems (see §13.4.4 below). In this particular case, it may be clearer for the pronoun ko’o to
be in a typical post-predicate position (§5.2.2) than inside the NP ‘my brother’, since the
pronoun position does not indicate any particular grammatical function of the pronoun,
only that the utterance concerns a Speech Act Participant, and the other order máxa ko’o
eyáxeg might be interpretable as ‘my brother is like me’. Here again, this amounts to say-
ing that the D and R nouns are not actually part of a constituent NP, and this is why they
are not in the unmarked, typical order.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.

proceeds as normal.

likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

(13.56), where the latter noun is a descriptor of the ﬁrst. For example, náta semheg is
a kind of náta bird and not a kind of semheg ‘dog’. These examples present plant and
animal names, but their order is that used in more productive uses of nouns as modiﬁers

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of

 7.5. Demonstratives followed by nouns
EDP enx038
Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.
",46.4482536315918,1,0.9092677515532316," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

the unmarked basic order is [R D]. However, when both outer and inner relations are
inalienable, the order for the outer relation appears to always be [D R], and in some cases
the order of the inner constituency is also [D R]. Although the constituent order ﬂips,
word order still maintains adjacency of the inner constituency.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt
 possessor, and still the order of the outer relation is [D R].

 At least in elicitation, these complex multiply embedded possessive NPs can function
 like a single unit, appearing together in the pre-verbal focus position as in (13.50). This
 example has an AN outer relation and an inner relation with the “possessive classiﬁer”
-tosso.

 However, in some cases, multiply embedded NPs do not actually appear to have a
 coherent internal structure. In (13.51), the inner relation is an AN possession Juan semheg
 apagkok ‘John’s dog’ and the outer is an IN possession semheg épakyek ‘dog’s tail’, but the
 actual construction, from a bracketing perspective, places the semantic outer relation
 inside of the inner relation. If ‘John’s dog’ is the possessor of ‘tail’, we would expect
 either **Juan semheg apagkok épakyek [R D] or **épakyek semheg apagkok Juan [D R], but
 instead we get the order in (13.51) which does not appear to order the elements in a way
which reﬂects the relative semantic scope of the elements.

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

ag-máha
1pl.irr-have-amb.nm:po

 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and

 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,

Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",65.93444061279297,1,0.8943784356571352
" Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.
",0,0.925371793128164,"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.
",35.805301666259766,0,0.891672448227088,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

animal names, but their order is that used in more productive uses of nouns as modiﬁers

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.
",53.99254989624024,1,0.9070889971450288," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Here, there are two possessive relations — an inner one ‘Carlos’ father’ and an outer
one ‘father’s chair’, so named because in a phrase structure analysis, the inner relation is
below the level of or within the outer relation [[Carlos’ father]’s chair]. We can identify the
inner relation as an example of inalienable possession (IA) (bound possessive preﬁx) and
the outer relation as an example of non-related possession (AN) (possessive pronoun).
In this instance with an inalienable inner relation and an alienable outer relation, the
constituent order intuitively ﬁts the pattern of AN NPs — the IA NP Carlos apyap ‘Carlos’
father’ ﬁts as a unit into the typical unmarked position for the possessor of the AN NP.
This type of embedding appears treats the inner NP as any ordinary NP, and word order
proceeds as normal.

NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.

",33.07755661010742,1,0.8901892768144165,"First, (13.37) provides some examples of the [R D Pro] order. If we consider the D
noun and the Pro to be a consituent unit, this [R D Pro] order appears to conform more
to the unmarked order in inalienably possessed NPs [R D]. In isolated, elicited possessive
NPs, as in (13.37a-13.37c), [R D Pro] is always the order of constituents, although I think
we should be cautious about assuming that this means it is the default, unmarked order.
This order also occurs with dependent NPs, as in (13.37d-13.37e).

The other order, [D Pro R], appears just as often and is equally common in discourse. It
is observed in isolated/appositive conditions as in (13.38a), with stative intransitive pred-
icates as in (13.38b-13.38d), and as the argument of a participial verb (13.38e-13.38f). I
have not, however, come across this order in dependent NPs which denote the patient of
a dyadic verb, as with the observed [R D Pro] order in (13.37e) above. This is probably
coincidental — NPs with all three elements are rare in general — and I know of no other
language where constituent order in NPs is dependent upon semantic or even grammati-
cal role.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
In the absence of a clear numerical tendency for one order over the other, and lacking
any grammatical reasoning to view one order as more basic than the other, it is reasonable
to assume that the variation in order has to do with whether the R or the D noun is more
salient or newsworthy in the context of the discourse, in much the same way that the
order of s-argument nouns of a predicate are ordered based on discourse factors. In the
natural speech examples above with a [R D Pro] order, (13.37d-13.37e), the R noun is new
information in the discourse, whereas in the natural speech examples with a [D Pro R]
order, the R noun is already an activated referent within the discourse.
",36.14251708984375,1,0.887330991707039," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.
",39.68590927124024,0,0.8857956521976333,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",46.1182975769043,0,0.9053975853775188,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

 ap-tem-akxaamyep yohoxma apagkok
 m.part-be.ti-nm:ob garden shaman poss.m
 ‘Customs of the yohoxma’s garden’
LC Aptemakxa
Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].
",48.330833435058594,1,0.8982636566108373," However, given the absence of formal cohesion mechanisms, they do not oﬀer
 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.
",36.20964813232422,3,0.8814395302549796," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.
",58.88755798339844,1,0.8669972977762407,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.
",66.05603790283203,1,0.8609477624553141,"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

5.1. Overview of Clause Structure
5.1.1 The content of the Enxet Sur clause
In describing the fundamental syntax of the clause in a given language, most grammar
writers center their descriptions on the transitive verbal clause — the unmarked order
of the verb and its two arguments, and how the morphosyntax of the language expresses
grammatical relations by assigning diﬀerent roles to the two diﬀerent arguments of the
verb. For many linguists and traditional grammarians, a clause is deﬁned by a verb and
its arguments, and anything lacking this structure is something less than a clause.
",3,0.938069531975396,"Nonetheless, such constructions clearly demonstrate the existence of a non-predicate
position available to nominal expressions which I simply call the nominal complement
(also always written in small caps to refer to the language-speciﬁc structural position).
The nominal complement can be post-verbal, which is its unmarked position in situations
of neutral focus or sentential focus, but it can be fronted ahead of a declarative verb for
constituent focus, either when the declarative verb is given information (see below) or
when the noun in the nominal complement position is more newsworthy than the verb.
Items like tame clitics, true adverbs, and personal pronouns always occur in the space
between these two elements, regardless of their order relative to one another.
",35.77684020996094,1,0.8959050278428321," Three of his publications25 with linguistic analysis are highly salient to the present
work. Unruh and Kalisch (2003) is the designation of the languages of the family and
some comparison between them, and is the source of the “Enlhet-Enenlhet” family name.
(Hannes Kalisch, 2019) describes the pragmatically-based word order of Enlhet Norte —
Kalisch’s ﬁndings are very similar to those presented for Enxet Sur in this dissertation in
§5.2.2.
",45.54197311401367,5,0.8832243083273117," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.
",54.397857666015625,1,0.8670636526650191,"Several morphosyntactic facts of Enxet Sur could be accounted for by this single prin-
ciple of a direct syntax, many relating to the lack of grammatical distinctions between
subject and object or other grammatical labels which might correspond to semantic roles
of agent and patient, which can largely be extended to non-distinction between core and
non-core s-arguments. These include:
• As has already been stated, nominal and pronominal expressions lack any kind of
case marking, either morphologically or expressed through word order (§5.2.2).
",55.74382400512695,5,0.8992102013648943," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

(13.56), where the latter noun is a descriptor of the ﬁrst. For example, náta semheg is
a kind of náta bird and not a kind of semheg ‘dog’. These examples present plant and
animal names, but their order is that used in more productive uses of nouns as modiﬁers

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.
",35.56062698364258,1,0.8856721098707236,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

13.6 Directions for further research
Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.
",44.6880989074707,1,0.8983730573017021," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak

 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

Dem-NP strings, then, are the only ones which might be viewed as containing adnom-
inal demonstratives, and are the core focus here. Note that this “ﬁxed” order means that
one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.
",44.68543243408203,1,0.9120923073164946,"We can also investigate constituent order in contexts with no overt D noun — in other
words, constructions where the possessive pronoun acts as a true possessive pronoun
(e.g. ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc.) with an overt possessor. The possessor occurring before the
possessive pronoun [R Pro] appears to only occur when the possessive NP is the predicate
of the sentence, as in (13.39a-13.39b), or when it is the subject of a negative identity
predicate háwe, as in (13.39c) . Otherwise, the order appears to typically be [Pro R], as in
(13.40). Note, however, that these examples are mostly from the Bible translation — it is
not so clear that this kind of construction is particularly common in the spoken language
(it may be, it just does not show up in the corpus used for this dissertation).

 13.4. The Possessed NP
13.4.3 Possessive classiﬁers?
Some sources have described Enxet Sur or related languages as having nominal posses-
sive classiﬁers (see Campbell and Grondona (2012, p. 647), though the same data has
been cited elsewhere). Such claims are based on a reading of very simple data in Grubb
(1911) or Sušnik (1977) which some have taken to be evidence of possessive classiﬁers, an
analysis which is promoted as much by the fact that possessive classiﬁers occur in neigh-
boring Guaycuruan and Matacoan languages as it is by actual EE data. I think this is
likely overstated — the forms identiﬁed as possessive classiﬁers are pretty transparently
just perfective form nominalizations (§3.4.3, §15.4), although they do have somewhat
distinct syntactic properties that suggest they could be analyzed as something like a pos-
sessive classiﬁer, or maybe that they have been lexicalized and modeled after possessive
classiﬁers in neighboring languages with which Enxet speakers have contact.

"What this means is that an NP can syntactically be part of the clause, but it acts
as a loosely deﬁned modiﬁer rather than fulﬁlling an argument selection process spec-
iﬁed by the verb. Predicates have a conceptual, semantic argument structure, and for
some word classes, especially verbs, some of this semantic argument structure is indi-
cated overtly through pronominal preﬁxes and valency adjusting morphology, but these
semantic structures do not require argument NPs (or independent pronouns, or pronomi-
nal aﬃxes, for that matter) for their realization. Instead, the nominal complement might
indicate the agent, patient, benefactor, or an adverbial modiﬁer. Which of these roles ﬁlls
the nominal complement slot is determined by pragmatic and information structure fac-
tors, but the slot itself does not make any kind of inherent distinction between diﬀerent
grammatical argument labels like ‘subject’ or ‘object’ or ‘oblique’.

",49.94416809082031,2,0.8374361496771753," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

Issues of noun phrase constituency and their relationship to appositional modiﬁers and
discontinuous noun phrases is a topic deserving of further study, which can draw from
work on other languages in other regions that show similar features. In such languages,
the reasons why it can be diﬃcult to decide whether elements form one nominal ex-
pression “include word order ﬂexibility, the absence of a clear-cut noun-adjective dis-
tinction, as well as the ubiquitous use of nominal forms in a wide range of grammatical
roles” (Reinöhl, 2020, p. 77), all of which are prominent issues in Enxet Sur and pre-
sumably other EE languages as well. Many treatments of noun phrase discontinuity in
other languages involve prosodic investigations, and therefore a better understanding of
the prosodic inventory of the language would be useful for understanding constituency
issues related to the noun phrase.

Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and

which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the

However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a

one argument often made for a lack of true adnominal demonstratives — that demonstra-
tives and co-referent NPs have no set relative word order — does not apply to Enxet Sur.
However, as I argue here, this appearance of a “ﬁxed” Dem-NP order is accounted for by
the ﬁxed position of the demonstrative as a clause-ﬁnal boundary marker which is then
followed by co-referent NPs. In other words, the order of these two elements is not free
because the position of the demonstrative enclitic is ﬁxed, but this is not the product of a
ﬁxed speciﬁer position for the demonstrative within a noun phrase.

Similarly, an NP might be followed by a demonstrative enclitic with which it is not
at all co-referential (similar to what is described in §7.3 above), and the demonstrative
in these cases is licensed by something above the adjacent noun. In both (7.57a) and
(7.57b), the demonstrative =xa refers to the subject of the predicate and not the noun
which precedes it, which is in an argument/object position in both cases — in (7.57a), the
noun is the object of a topological predicate ketok ‘it is near’, and in (7.57b), the noun is
the NP complement of the predicate.

semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal

"Without any further data, we can already extrapolate some major descriptive claims
from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.
",0,0.938069531975396," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

",52.34821319580078,0,0.8881114569648811," An ordering template dictates the relative order of stem-forming morphology, and
although in some cases lexicalization of stems has led to analyzable stem-forming mor-
phemes “jumping the template” or occurring out of order, the order of morphemes is not
manipulable for semantic eﬀect — one cannot, for example, change the relative orders of
morphemes indicating the causative and associated motion to alternate between ‘make
him do X when I get there’ and ‘do X when I make him go there’. In morphophonologi-
cal terms, there is a substantial degree of fusion between stem-forming morphology and
between stem morphology and the grammatical suﬃxes. As such, many suﬃx combina-
tions lack discernable phonological boundaries, and it is easier, at least for the sake of
glossing, to refer to single suﬃxes with multiple exponence.

from Grubb. The ﬁrst is that, if Enxet speakers need two clauses and two verbs to dis-
ambiguate the roles of two NPs, this may suggest that Enxet syntax lacks a means of as-
signing semantic roles like agent and patient to grammatical roles like subject and object.
Grubb uses the terms “subject” and “object”, but it is important to keep in mind that even
modern linguists of the 21st century sometimes use these terms in a ways which conﬂates
semantic roles with grammatical ones. I return to the distinction between semantic and
grammatical roles in the next section.

without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-
course of any language, and based on the syntactic proﬁle of the language presented in
this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha

ag-máha

‘The Ibis Tree (Spanish yerba de lucero is a medicine we can use’
 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet
háwe waley anmen // wánxa apagkok =apagko’ énxet
neg Paraguayan alcohol // only m.poss =tc:deg.m Enxet
‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5. Noun compounding
13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.
(13.54) Tetet yámet ekteme xáma panaqte negmawána agmáha
tetet yámet ek-tem-e xáma panaqte neg-m-a-wán-a
ibis tree f.part-be.ti-nm:pv one medicine 1pl.part-ti-vblz-able-nm:pv
ag-máha
1pl.irr-have-amb.nm:po
‘The Ibis Tree (Spanish yerba de lucero is a medicine we can use’
 Schoolbook Grade 4
This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

"Unlike the tame clitics described in Ch. 6, the topical demonstratives are more re-
stricted in their distribution and position relative to the verb, and they do not move rel-
ative to their hosts or relative to the head of the clause. Take for example the simple
sentence in (7.24a). It shows the unmarked order for its three components: verb =tame
=demonstrative.
",1,0.9422141858280418," Still, I would even argue against an analysis that SS and P marking are aligned in
Enxet Sur in the ﬁrst person — although it is a point which informed linguists could rea-
sonably disagree upon. First, Ch. 8 presents a number of arguments against considering
semiverbs as simply verbs which take stative as opposed to active preﬁxes, the primary
one being that in order to take any verbal morphology other than the declarative or in-
tensive, they require a derivational stem morpheme, at which point they take the same
pronominal preﬁxes as any other verbs. In other words, the diﬀerent sets of pronominal
preﬁxes they take should be seen as two diﬀerent paradigms for two distinct word classes,
rather than two semantically distinct sets of preﬁxes which both attach to verbs.
",33.64280319213867,0,0.937889122886276," The remainder of this chapter primarily discusses morphological issues with these
 two word classes, primarily the more morphologically complex semiverbs. Beyond the
 basic morphosyntactic distinctions made above, the two classes can be further deﬁned
 against other word classes and against each other on the following morphosyntactic and
 semantic criteria:
 • Both semiverbs and adjectives take the (mostly) unique stative pronominal preﬁx
 paradigm, but some adjectives take the unmarked, non-stative feminine verbal pre-
 ﬁx (section 8.2)
 • Semiverbs take a distinct, partially fused negative stative pronominal preﬁx paradigm
 (negative marker and pronominal preﬁx are fused)(section 14.2.3); Adjectives can-
 not be negated morphologically, only with the identity negative hawe (§14.3; also
 used for nouns)
 • Semiverbs require a derivational preﬁx [vblz] in order to take non-inﬂectional mor-
 phology otherwise restricted to verbs, including nominalized forms and direction-
 als (section 8.6); Adjectives cannot be derived
 • Semiverbs take the plural marker -’a’ak (similar to most nominal plurals) while ad-
 jectives are marked for plurality with a range of diﬀerent suﬃxes including the
 intensive suﬃx. In both cases, morphological indication of plurality is not fully
 obligatory
 • While both classes are semantically stative/atelic, semiverbs generally relate capa-
 bilities or behavioral properties of individuals, while adjectives indicate inherent
 qualities not based on the performance of an action (size, quantity, birth-order)
 The following sections of the chapter begin with a description of the stative pronomi-
 nal preﬁxes (§8.2), followed by a description of the declarative suﬃx on semiverbs (§8.3),
 plurality of semiverbs (§8.4), and the uses of the intensive suﬃx in both classes (§8.5).
 Finally, the morphological derivation of semiverbs stems which allows them to function
 as full verb stems is described in §8.6.

 discrete criteria to deﬁne syntactic categories in morpho-syntactic terms and
 in the present work, these formal characteristics have not been discussed in
 depth. They are related to parameters such as intonation, pause of speech, the
 existence or not of clisis between words, the use of particles and conjunctions,
 the use of demonstratives, the distinction of lexical categories, verbal valence,
 subordination mechanisms, verb tense, word order and syntactic parenthesis,
 general constituent order.

13.4. The Possessed NP
Skype 11.20.19
Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.
(13.35)ko’o ahagkok xapop, yaqwatakxoho kélheykha eyke aqsa kéxegke kañe’ nak

 =aqsa kexegke kane =nak
 =just 2plinside =tc:vis
 ‘The land is mine, and you all are here for a short time’
Leviticus 25 23
It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

Some nominal constructions may create the illusion that a [Pro D] order is possible.
For example in (13.35) there is a Pro before a coreferent D, but the structure here is a
predicate ko’o ahagkok ‘is mine’ with a subject noun xapop ‘land’. The two are not, then,
part of a single constituent NP.

It is considerably less clear what the unmarked order is when all three components
are used and an overt possessor is included. There are almost no documented examples
of the possessor coming between the possessee and the pronoun [D R Pro], except for the
title of a story seen in (13.36).

Why this order occurs in this one instance is unclear, but in general, the possessed
noun and possessive pronoun, [D Pro], constitutes a solid unit that cannot be broken up,
and variations in order concern whether the R noun comes before or after the [D Pro]
unit. There is fairly equal occurrence of [R D Pro] and [D Pro R].

 13.4. The Possessed NP
have overt possessor nouns, and the [D Pro] order is clear. Given that possessive pronouns
can be the heads of NPs on their own, this order likely indicates that the possessive pro-
noun acts a dependent modiﬁer of the D noun to its left, since this is the typical position
for all other dependent modiﬁers except numerals/quantiﬁers.

 While this reversal of the outer relation reﬂects a common trend in the NP — complex
 constituents get moved to the right — the reversal occurs even in embedded possession
without an (overtly) complex inner possessive NP. For example, in (13.49), the possessor
 of apwáxok ‘his insides’ is also a possessed noun étche ‘your child’, but there is no overt

 Multiply embedded possession, especially with overt possessors, is rare in the dis-

this description and in the Enlhet Norte description of Kalisch (2009), I am suspicious
that these structures would actually get used in real speech. Nonetheless, the available
data presents some interesting patterns and problems. Further study should conﬁrm the
grammaticality and felicitousness of such constructions with a broader range of speakers
and attempt to ﬁnd them in naturally occurring (i.e. non-elicited) speech.
13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

‘It wasn’t Paraguayan alcohol, it was only the Enxet’s’
(López Ramírez, 1988)
 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.

13.5 Noun compounding
The primary kind of noun compounding in Enxet Sur is noun-noun compounding, where
two non-related nouns are put together to form a single noun. For example, in (13.54),
two non-related nouns — tetet ‘ibis’ and yámet ‘tree, plant’ — are put together to form
the name of an herb tetet yámet, known in Spanish as yerba de lucero.

This is largely a lexical process, meaning that noun compounding is most prevalent
as a means of creating names for plants and animals, and that probably, like much of
the nominal morphology, it is not a conventionally productive process so much as it is a
means by which new terms are coined. However, I include it in this chapter because it
is a process by which lexical nouns can act as modiﬁers of other lexical nouns, and the
degree to which this kind of compounding is “productive” is very much an open question
worthy of further investigation.

13.4.6Possession by simple adjacency
Some apparent possessive constructions involve simple juxtaposition of possessor and
possessee with no overt morphological indicators of possession. These juxtapositions can
occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-

occur in either order (R–D or D–R), and are most often used for a possession of general
association rather than ownership or discrete relationship. For example, in (13.52), there
is a semantic possessor waley ‘Paraguayan’ and possessee anmen ‘alcohol’, but there is no
use of the possessive pronoun. This does not refer to alcohol belonging to a particular
Paraguayan, but instead the type of alcohol made by Paraguayans.
(13.52)Háwe waley anmen, wánxa apagkok apagko’ énxet

 A similar phenomenon involves the establishment of association by paratactic predi-
cates. For example, in (13.53), xapop ‘land’ is the subject of the ﬁrst predicate awanhek
‘it is big’, and then a secondary nominal predicate énxet asserts some kind of relationship
between énxet and xapop, even though it is not really established by any overt morphosyn-
tactic mechanism. Even if one chooses to analyse énxet nano’ as some kind of dependent
instead of an independent clause, this would still be an example of association or posses-
sion established by adjacency instead of any formal possession mechanism.
