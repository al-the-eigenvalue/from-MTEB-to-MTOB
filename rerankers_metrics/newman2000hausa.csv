3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned

Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,

Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 gender with the underlying subject, and a marker of tense/aspect/mood (TAM), which in some cases is
 phonologicallyzero (see §70:1).",67.60271453857422,1,0.3273029653973662

2.3. Subject fronting(topicalization)
The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,

subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 A peculiarity of gr5 verbs concerns the use and position of d& when the sentence contains an indirect
 object (i.0.). (For purposes of the exposition here, I shall refer to the thematic direct object as d.o. even
 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

 occur immediately after the verb and before the direct object as in all other dialects.) This word order
 ive of the meaningis undoubtedly an innovation due to interference from Chadic languages in the region, where noun
 1.0. phrases typically occur after the d.o. (see Newman 1982). It is very unlikely that this represents
 a retention of an old Chadic word-order pattern.

3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura

Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 9.3.1. Grade 5 with indirect objects
 A peculiarity of gr5 verbs concerns the use and position of d& when the sentence contains an indirect
 object (i.0.). (For purposes of the exposition here, I shall refer to the thematic direct object as d.o. even
 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

 nant, i.e., the
‘his variant isWith noun i.o.’s, on the other hand, the matter is much more complicated. Here one finds four different
ted and deemed possibilities, all of which are considered to be fully grammatical: (1) In the first, the indirect object
 marker wa and the particle da are “stacked” one after the other, followed by their respective objects,
 e.g., 24i fitat wa da Tankd akwati ‘He will take out the box for Tanko.’ This is the preferred option for
th the verb in many SH speakers.",34.50669479370117,1,0.3210797324212721," 3.1.4. Numerals and other quantifiers
, for example, means Cardinal numbers and otherquantifiers (including ideophones) directly follow thehead noun, with
eviously referred to optional use of various unit measure terms (see §53:1.7), e.g.,

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 Applicatives, i.e., grade 1 verbs with an applicative extension, differ (not #
 from neutral transitives in two
respects. First, the d.o. is often semantically an instrumental rather thanya ke
 a thematic patient. Second, the
verb normally requires that a third argument be expressed in addition to(not *
 the subject and the d.o. This third
argument is commonly an indirect object, but it may also be a locative(b) al
 or a prepositional phrase.

Some verbs allow double direct objects, e.g., Ex.

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

 ive of the meaningis undoubtedly an innovation due to interference from Chadic languages in the region, where noun

 a retention of an old Chadic word-order pattern.

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:

 A peculiarity of gr5 verbs concerns the use and position of d& when the sentence contains an indirect
 object (i.0.). (For purposes of the exposition here, I shall refer to the thematic direct object as d.o. even
 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 9.3.1. Grade 5 with indirect objects

 object (i.0.). (For purposes of the exposition here, I shall refer to the thematic direct object as d.o. even
 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

2.3. Subject fronting(topicalization)
The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

the verb and the subject, but this is extremely rare. More common is number agreement or semantic

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an

Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

12. FUTURE
In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should
 [za talgyt Wanke kv

be written as two words, except in the case of the contractions. The main reason given for this
rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su
We are nc
modal particle, e.g., z4 k6 sd daw6 ‘They however will return.” (lit. fut however they return), whereas
this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

eviously referred to optional use of various unit measure terms (see §53:1.7), e.g.,

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:
his/that/those, etc.’
 namely, nan ‘this’, mata hudunasahis four wives (lit. wives four his)

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:

that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

Bello’s house is behind the hospital close to the carpenter’s workshop.

that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

 the suffix. Four of the derived nouns have all H tone; the others have H-L tone: the choice is lexically
 determined and cannot be accounted for by general rule. One example (rare, but listed in the dictionaries)
 is reported with an L-H-L pattern in addition to all H.

subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

Comparison at a clausal level is indicated by connectingtwo clauses bymeans of the subordinating
conjunction da ‘than (that)’. (The clause following da appears with a bare L-tone weak subject pronoun

elements like modal particles or the stabilizer, e.g.,

According to the general formula X Y STAB, the stabilizer occurs at the end of the sentence after the
predicate constituting the Y. Deviations from this order result from two independent factors: focus and Another strategy w

pleonastic pronoun described above in §4 is commonly used along with focused NPs. Examples:

, for example, means Cardinal numbers and otherquantifiers (including ideophones) directly follow thehead noun, with
eviously referred to optional use of various unit measure terms (see §53:1.7), e.g.,
 he form ‘n/*-f/ “n

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:
his/that/those, etc.’
 namely, nan ‘this’, mata hudunasahis four wives (lit. wives four his)
ere adverbs meaningmotéci shida namoour six cars (lit. cars six ours)
, to anoun plus the

",56.51234436035156,1,0.6464487766832613," The fourth restriction relates to vowel sequences. In trisyllabic words with a short high vowel in the
 unterparts cannotco-first syllable, a high vowel in the next syllable will necessarily be identical, ie., CiCiCV and CuCuCV
tr order. On the other are possible, but **CiCuCV and **CuCiCV are not,e.g., binciké ‘investigate’, jimina ‘ostrich’,
dad ‘pleasantness’,rigima ‘dispute’; duraml ‘fig tree’, gdndura ‘become fed up’, tikina ‘(not) yet’. The only exceptions
 ples of /s/ — /ts/ with are verbal nouns of gr7 verbs with the ending -uwa, e.g., nitsuwa ‘reflection’, niRuwa (sometimes
 pronounced [nikuwa]) ‘grindable’.

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam
thank you and I indeed owe you one. Allah ya saka da alheri!

12. FUTURE
In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

be written as two words, except in the case of the contractions. The main reason given for this
rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su

this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

subject to some degree of flexibility, e.g.,
gidan Belld yana bayan asibiti kusa da shagon kafinta

Bello’s house is behind the hospital close to the carpenter’s workshop.

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam
thank you and I indeed owe you one. Allah ya saka da alheri!

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam
thank you and I indeed owe you one. Allah ya saka da alheri!

12. FUTURE
In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

be written as two words, except in the case of the contractions. The main reason given for this
rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su

this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret

The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC

contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su

this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret

morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d

contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should

The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should
