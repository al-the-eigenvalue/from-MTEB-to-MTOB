 BASIC SENTENCEWORD ORDER
1. The basic word order of a Tsimshian sentenceis (a) temporal
designator,transitive verb,ergative noun phrase,absolutive
noun phrase (TEMP VB,, ERG ABS), or (b)temporaldesignator, in-
transitive verb, absOlutivenounphrase(TEMP VB.",63.37361907958984,5,0.6722545099946416,"The major part of the grammar is
concerned with the structure and use of the verbs.
",65.86672973632812,0,0.4944903788440523,"It also containssect-
ions dealing with pronunciation and sound changes,word forma-
tion(morphology), and syntax.",68.21163940429688,0,0.6678286265072922," Verbs agree in number with their
absolutive(transitive object or intransitivesubject).",67.59212493896484,0,0.6974025046294369
" Verbs agree in number with their
absolutive(transitive object or intransitivesubject).",0,0.6831968651624872,"It also containssect-
ions dealing with pronunciation and sound changes,word forma-
tion(morphology), and syntax.",40.01612854003906,0,0.7964692173793639," Then the sentence pattern
TEMP+t VB,+daERG+aABS
becomes
TEMPVB,ptMt+ABS+aERG,
i.e.,the absolutive becomes a part of the verb as a compound
word and the ergative functions syntactically as an absolutive.
Someexamples of absolutiveincorporation:
a) Bawilaadmhoonu (bawil TEMP;aat VB,,;-m-; hoon ABS; -u
ERG;and then I was just seiningfor fish or I was
just now fish-seining)
b) Yagwa suwiliinsgmwudziis Dzon (Yagwa TEMP;suwiliinsk VB
-m-;wudzii ABS; -s;Dzon ERG;John ishunting cari-
bou or John is caribou-hunting)
c) Yagwateemlaks nagwat(Yagwa TEMP;tee VB,;-m-;lakABS;
-S; nagwat ERG;his father is haulingfirewood)
5. An indirect object follows the absolutive in the sentence

their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,

their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,

their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,

thing,place,or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,or that is in some way a consequence of the origi-
nal word.",33.767147064208984,0,0.8704594957499164,"Whenusedas a noun,thefirst

GRAMMATICAL SUFFIXES
1. There are ten suffixes which,when attached to words,change
their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,
etc.).
2. The suffix -x (sometimes -k) derivesa word that refers to a
thing,place,or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,or that is in some way a consequence of the origi-
nal word.",44.60152816772461,0,0.5408498096320519,"This second set is
