Supyire,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, it is evident that standard negation in Supyire can be marked by modifications of the verb or by affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Clause Final Negative Particles**: The language uses clause final negative particles such as ""mä"" and ""mi"" which are placed at the end of the clause. These particles are not phonologically bound to the verb, but they are part of the negation strategy in Supyire.

- **Negative Marking in Auxiliary Position**: The language employs negative marking in the auxiliary position, which can involve the addition of the copula ""pye"" before the auxiliary to signal negation early in the clause. For example:
  - ""M)) pye ά yaaga ta mi."" (I didn't get a thing.)
  - ""Wüu pye na jina pää me."" (We don't see (a) jinn.)

- **Low Tone Marking**: For auxiliaries with high tone, negation is marked by introducing a floating low tone that docks onto the auxiliary. This is a clear instance of a phonological modification of the verb to indicate negation. For example:
  - ""Yi si ß-jä ύτύ jyiile mi."" (They won't be able to cross it.)
  - ""U cää ρέε m-pä nähä me."" (It (the bushcat) will not try to come here.)

- **Prohibitive Auxiliary**: The prohibitive auxiliary ""kä"" is marked with a negative low tone, indicating another form of phonological modification for negation.

- **Privative Nominalizer**: The language has a negative affix ""-mbää"" attached to verbs, indicating a privative meaning (without). For example:
  - ""Cedyi wä υ mäha m-pyi pyä bää."" (A certain woman was childless.)

These examples demonstrate that Supyire uses both phonological modifications (such as low tone marking) and affixes (such as ""-mbää"") to mark standard negation, fulfilling the criteria for option 1.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jamsay,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1 (2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs)**:
   - The paragraph explicitly states that negation is expressed by verbal suffixation, with distinct negative suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs.
   - Examples provided include:
     - **bE$rE$-go@-w** (‘be.able-ImpfNeg-2SgS’ meaning ‘You-Sg cannot’)
     - **ya$˘-li@˘-Ø** (‘go-PerfNeg-1PlS’ meaning ‘We did not go’)

2. **Paragraph 2 (10.1.3 Negation of indicative verbs)**:
   - This section further elaborates on the use of negative suffixes for both perfective and imperfective verbs.
   - For perfective verbs, the negative suffix **-li@-** is used.
   - For imperfective verbs, the negative suffix **-go@-** is used.
   - Examples provided include:
     - **ya$˘-li@-Ø** (‘go-PerfNeg-3SgS’ meaning ‘he/she didn’t go’)
     - **E$˘-lu@-m** (‘see-PerfNeg-1SgS’ meaning ‘I didn’t see’)
     - **de$ne$-go@-m** (‘want-ImpfNeg-1SgS’ meaning ‘I don’t want’)
     - **sa$˘-go@-Ø** (‘respond-ImpfNeg-3SgS’ meaning ‘it will not respond’)

These examples clearly show that negation in Jamsay is marked by suffixes that are attached to the verb, indicating that the negation is phonologically bound to the verb.

Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, it is clear that standard negation in Ma'di is marked by sentence-final negation words such as ""kü"" or ""küru"". These negation words are not affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb, nor do they involve any modification of the verb itself. Instead, they function as separate particles that appear at the end of the sentence.

Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Negation Words as Separate Particles**: The negation words ""kü"" and ""küru"" are described as sentence-final negation words that are placed at the end of the sentence. They are not bound to the verb but rather follow the verb and other sentence constituents.
   - Example: ""má mû ku"" (IS go NEG(N)) meaning ""I will not go"" or ""I am not going.""

2. **Uninflected Verbs**: The verb in a negated sentence is always uninflected, and the tense is expressed by the choice of the negation word rather than any modification of the verb itself.
   - Example: ""m-awí djotl kü"" (IS-open door NEG(N)) meaning ""I won't open the door"" or ""I don't open doors.""

3. **Negation in Subordinate Clauses**: Even in subordinate clauses, the negation particles ""kü"" and ""küru"" are used in a similar manner, indicating that they are separate particles rather than affixes or clitics.
   - Example: ""indri e-d^i-re küru η"" ([goat (N)-VE-take-SB NEG(P)] DEF) meaning ""Who is it that did not bring a goat?""

Given these points, it is evident that standard negation in Ma'di is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by separate negation particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Bangime,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negative Marker [bíè]**: The negative morpheme [bíè] is used to negate sentences. It can precede a noun, follow a noun, or precede a verb.
2. **Negation with Verbs**: The negative marker precedes the verb in negated clauses. This is explicitly stated in section 14.6: ""The negative marker [bie] precedes the verb just as it does a noun.""
3. **Tonal Effects**: The negative marker affects the tone of the noun it precedes, and there are specific tonal patterns associated with negated clauses.

Given this information, the negative marker [bíè] is used to negate verbs by preceding them, forming a phonological unit with the verb. This qualifies as a method of standard negation involving a phonologically bound element.

### Reasoning:
- The negative marker [bíè] is described as preceding the verb, which means it is phonologically bound to the verb.
- The description does not indicate that [bíè] is a free-standing particle when used with verbs, but rather it forms a unit with the verb it negates.

### Conclusion:

Gumuz,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The paragraph mentions that in both NoG (Northern Gumuz) and parts of SoG (Southern Gumuz, specifically Kamashi), the negative clitic `=(a)ŋg̩ ó` attaches to the end of the conjugated verb.
   - Example (7.76) shows the negative clitic `=ŋgó` attached to the verb form `úú-a-n-tsʼóχó-na` (3PL.TR-RECP-PL-kidnap-LOC), resulting in `úú-a-n-tsʼóχó-na=ŋgó` (they don’t kidnap from each other).

From this information, it is clear that the negative clitic `=(a)ŋg̩ ó` is phonologically bound to the verb, as it attaches directly to the conjugated verb form.

**Reasoning:**
- The negative marker `=(a)ŋg̩ ó` is described as a clitic that attaches to the verb, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb.
- The example provided demonstrates the cliticization of the negative marker to the verb, confirming that standard negation in Gumuz can be marked by a phonologically bound clitic.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

**Paragraph 1:**
- The example (8) shows the sentence structure with negation:
  - ""ay na guna [[huu di] kuna] [boro foo]""
  - Gloss: ""ISgS Neg see [[house Def] Loc] [person one]""
  - Translation: ""I didn't see anyone in the house.""
- Here, ""na"" is identified as the negation marker in the MAN (mood-aspect-negation) position, which is separate from the verb ""guna"" (see).

**Paragraph 2:**
- Example (258c) shows another negation structure:
  - ""yer ma si goro nee""
  - Gloss: ""1PlS Subju Neg sit here""
  - Translation: ""(that) we not sit (=live) here""
- Example (258e) also shows negation:
  - ""ni si yadda ay ma koy ka nan ni""
  - Gloss: ""2SgS ImpfNeg consent ISgS Subju go Inf leave 2SgO""
  - Translation: ""You do not consent that I go leave you.""
- In both examples, ""si"" is used as a negation marker in the context of subjunctive and imperfective negation.

### Reasoning:
- In both paragraphs, the negation markers ""na"" and ""si"" are separate words that occupy specific positions in the sentence structure (MAN position and before the verb, respectively).
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that these negation markers are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself. They appear to be separate particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
Given the information from the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine that standard negation in Koyra Chiini is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negation markers appear to be separate particles.

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Seme, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Marker**: The negation in Seme is marked by the clause-final particle ""bo"" as shown in example (101):
   ```
   À ri le dì bo.
   3SG FIN food eat.PRFV NEG
   'S/he didn't eat.'
   ```

2. **Position and Use**: The particle ""bo"" is used at the end of the clause to indicate negation. There is no indication that ""bo"" is phonologically bound to the verb ""dì"" or any other word in the clause. It appears to be a separate word (particle) that follows the verb phrase.

3. **Tense Marker Interaction**: The examples in (102) show the interaction of the past tense marker ""ín"" with the negation particle ""bo"". The placement of ""ín"" before or after ""bo"" does not change the fact that ""bo"" remains a separate particle:
   ```
   À ri le dì ín bo.
   3SG FIN food eat.PRFV PST NEG
   'S/he didn't eat (awhile ago).'
   ```

Given the information provided, there is no evidence that the negation marker ""bo"" is an affix, clitic, or involves any modification of the verb. It is consistently described and exemplified as a separate particle that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation marker ""bo"" is a clause-final particle and not an affix or clitic.
- There is no indication of phonological binding between ""bo"" and the verb.
- The examples provided consistently show ""bo"" as a separate word.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Tima,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tima, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language.

### Reasoning:

1. **Negation as Verbal Inflection:**
   - Paragraph 1 (2.4.1.3 Negation) mentions that Tima uses two obligatory negative particles: the negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic marker '-Vŋ'. These markers are described as external to the verb word but are phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Paragraph 2 (4.6.1 Negative declarative) further elaborates that the negative particle 'kV-' is procliticised to the verb, and the negative particle '-Vŋ' is encliticised to the verb or verb phrase. This indicates that these negative markers form a phonological unit with the verb.

2. **Examples of Negation:**
   - The examples provided in Paragraph 2 (4.6.1) show the negative markers attached to the verb:
     - Intransitive clause: `kɨ-n-dɪyana-dʌ-ʌŋ` (NEG-1sg-laugh-1sg-NEG) for ""I did not laugh"".
     - Transitive clause: `kɨ-ŋ-kamah-dʌ it̪uk-ʌŋ` (NEG-Person-eat-1sg porridge-NEG) for ""I did not eat porridge"".
     - Ditransitive clause: `ku-dudu-ii-dʌ t̪amaa d-umurik-ʌŋ` (NEG-show-APPL-1sg speech NC-Tima language-NEG) for ""Hamid does not teach me Tima language"".

3. **Phonological Binding:**
   - The negative markers 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' are described as proclitic and enclitic respectively, indicating that they are phonologically bound to the verb. This is further supported by the examples where these markers are directly attached to the verb forms.

### Conclusion:
1

The standard negation in Tima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb, as evidenced by the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ' that are phonologically bound to the verb.",1,1
!Xun (Ekoka),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negation markers are pre-verbal clitics**: The text explicitly states that ""Negation markers are pre-verbal clitics (in case there is a verb)."" This indicates that the negation markers attach to the verb in a phonologically bound manner.

2. **Examples of negation markers**: The examples provided show the negation marker *l6a used in sentences:
   - ""a Iwi saa."" (2SG NEG hear) – ‘You do not hear.’
   - ""mi m kd ki l6a"" (1SG TOP PAST PROG NEG) – ‘He was not coming.’

3. **Cliticization**: The negation markers *l6a and *kora are described as clitics, which means they are phonologically bound to the verb they negate.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negation markers in !Xun (Ekoka) are described as pre-verbal clitics, which means they attach to the verb and form a phonological unit with it.
- The examples provided in the text show the negation marker *l6a directly preceding the verb, further supporting the claim that it is bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Katcha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language Katcha. The paragraphs given do not contain sufficient information about the negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences. They primarily discuss locative adverbs, case markers, and the construction of argument nodes, without addressing how negation is marked on verbs specifically.

1. The first paragraph (118) discusses locative adverbs and their placement in sentences, but it does not provide any information about negation markers or their attachment to verbs.
2. The second paragraph (212) focuses on the role of case markers and adpositions in relation to noun phrases and verbs, but again, it does not mention how negation is marked on verbs.

Without specific information on how negation is marked on verbs in Katcha, it is not possible to determine whether standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Ijo (Kolokuma),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ijo (Kolokuma), it is possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted and analyzed:

1. **Negation Marker**: The text states that sentences are made negative by the introduction of the marker **-a** between the last verb and the aspect marker. This indicates that the negation is achieved through an affix that attaches directly to the verb.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Simple past**: 
     - Affirmative: *a b6-mi* (""she came"")
     - Negative: *a b6-a* (""she did not come"")
   - **Simple/continuous present**:
     - Affirmative: *a b6-yemi* (""she is coming"")
     - Negative: *a b6-a* (""she is not coming"")
   - **Simple future**:
     - Affirmative: *a b6-gimi* (""she will come"")
     - Negative: *a b6-a, fa-qjmi* (""she will not come"")
   - **Immediate past**:
     - Affirmative: *a b6-dqy* (""she has come"")
     - Negative: *a b6-a* (""she has not come"")

3. **Analysis**:
   - The negation marker **-a** is clearly an affix that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.
   - The examples provided show consistent use of this affix across different tenses and aspects, confirming that it is a standard method of negation in Ijo (Kolokuma).

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Ijo (Kolokuma) can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Emai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, it is clear that standard negation in Emai involves the use of specific morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Negation Morphemes and Verb Tone**: The paragraphs describe that Emai uses specific negation morphemes (ì for Perfect Negation, khà for Prospective Negation, and yà for Past Absolute Negation) which precede the verb and affect its tone. For example:
   - **Perfect Negation**: ""ó ì è émàè"" (he NEG eat food) - Here, the negation morpheme ""ì"" is directly preceding and affecting the verb ""è"" (eat).
   - **Prospective Negation**: ""ó khà è ólí émàè"" (he PRONEG eat the food) - The negation morpheme ""khà"" precedes and affects the verb ""è"" (eat).
   - **Past Absolute Negation**: ""ó yà shèn úkpùn"" (he PANEG sell cloth) - The negation morpheme ""yà"" precedes and affects the verb ""shèn"" (sell).

2. **Phonological Binding**: The negation morphemes are described as being phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by the consistent low tone on the verb when these morphemes are used. This suggests that the negation morphemes form a phonological unit with the verb.

3. **Affixation and Cliticization**: The use of morphemes like ""ì"", ""khà"", and ""yà"" directly attached to the verb indicates that these are either affixes or clitics. The grammar explicitly marks these morphemes as part of the verb phrase, showing that they are not free-standing particles but are bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Ik,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negating Verbs**: The language uses highly irregular negating verbs such as ""ńt-"", ""ma-"", ""na-"", and ""mo-"" to express negation. These verbs fill the syntactic slot for the main verb in a clause.

2. **Complement Clause**: The negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood (or realis mood in the case of prohibitives) as a kind of complement clause.

3. **Examples**:
   - (140) Nta ƙod.
     - ńt-á (not-REAL) + ƙó-dⁱ (go-2SG[IRR])
     - Translation: ""You don’t go.""
   - (141) Maa naa ƙod.
     - má-á=naa (not-REAL=PST) + ƙó-dⁱ (go-2SG[IRR])
     - Translation: ""You didn’t go (earlier today).""
   - (142) Maa ƙod.
     - má-á (not-REAL) + ƙó-d-ᵃ (go-2SG-REAL)
     - Translation: ""Don’t go.""
   - (138) Moo ƙod.
     - mo-o (not-SEQ) + ƙó-dⁱ (go-2SG[IRR])
     - Translation: ""And you don’t go.""

From these points, it is evident that the negating verbs (ńt-, ma-, na-, mo-) are phonologically bound to the verb forms they negate. The negating verbs themselves are modifications of the verb, and in some cases, they are combined with suffixes or clitics (e.g., ""má-á=naa"").

**Reasoning**:
- The negating verbs are bound to the verb forms they negate, either through affixation or cliticization.
- The negating verbs modify the verb forms directly, indicating that the negation is marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the information to determine the method of standard negation in Ngiti. Here are the key points:

1. **Negative Markers**: The paragraph mentions three negative markers: ""inzi,"" ""inzé,"" and ""imba."" These markers have both long and short forms. The short forms are ""nzi,"" ""nza,"" and ""mba,"" respectively.

2. **Position in the Sentence**: The negative markers can be placed either in the initial position of the sentence or immediately following the conjugated verb.

3. **Modification of Form**: When used non-initially, the initial vowel ""i-"" is deleted, resulting in forms like ""nzi,"" ""nza,"" and ""mba.""

From this information, we can infer that the negative markers are not described as affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they appear to be separate words (particles) that can occupy different positions in the sentence. The deletion of the initial vowel ""i-"" when the marker is non-initial does not necessarily indicate that the marker is phonologically bound to the verb; it is more likely a phonological process affecting the marker itself.

Given the guidelines and examples provided, the evidence does not support that standard negation in Ngiti is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The markers are described as separate entities that can be placed in different positions within the sentence.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative markers are described as separate words (particles) that can be placed either at the beginning of the sentence or after the conjugated verb.
- There is no indication that these markers are phonologically bound to the verb as affixes or clitics.
- The deletion of the initial vowel ""i-"" is a phonological process affecting the marker itself, not an indication of it being bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negative Proclitic di=**: The grammar explicitly mentions a negative proclitic ""di="" that is phonologically bound to the beginning of a clause-final constituent or a constituent in the focus position. This proclitic can attach directly to verbs, as seen in examples (3.437) to (3.442).

2. **Examples of di= with Verbs**:
   - (3.437) ""di=haw-ø-anno"" (NEG=forget-3SG.M-IMPRF.3) translates to ""He does not forget people’s names.""
   - (3.438) ""di=a-ø-ino"" (NEG=drink-3SG.M-P.PRF.3) translates to ""He did not drink milk.""
   - (3.439) ""di=no"" (NEG=exist.P.PRF.3) translates to ""Flies do not exist in the house.""
   - (3.440) ""di=u-i-t-ino"" (NEG=give-EP-3SG.F-P.PRF.3) translates to ""Bule did not give food to Dangura.""
   - (3.441) ""di=t’uur-oo-mm-o"" (NEG=milk-P.PRF.1-1SG-M) translates to ""I did not milk that cow.""
   - (3.442) ""di=odo’l-a bat’-ø-anno"" (NEG=play-INF like-3SG.M-IMPRF.3) translates to ""Lashe likes not playing outside (but doing something else outside).""

3. **Attachment to Verbs**: The negative proclitic ""di="" attaches directly to verbs in various aspects (present perfect, imperfect, progressive, continuous), indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Sidaama can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mursi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, it is clear that standard negation in Mursi can be marked by affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. Specifically, the language employs bound circumclitics for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect and a combination of a negative particle and a negative enclitic for verbs in the perfective aspect. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Imperfective Aspect**: Negation is marked by the circumclitics ŋà= (proclitic) and =ó (enclitic) surrounding the verb root. For example, in the sentence ""ŋà=hín-Ø=ó"" (NEG.IMPERV=want.IMPERV-2sg.SU.IMPERV=NEG), the negation is marked by the circumclitics attached to the verb root ""hín"".
  
- **Perfective Aspect**: Negation involves the independent negative particle ŋànì and the negative enclitic =ó attached to the verb root. For instance, in ""ŋànì k-íríčá=ó"" (NEG.PERV 3.SBJV-born.PERV=NEG), the negation is marked by the particle ŋànì and the enclitic =ó.

- **Imperative and Hortative Forms**: The negative imperative is formed by attaching the proclitic ŋà= to the verb root, as seen in ""ŋà=ɓág-í"" (NEG.IMPERV=eat.IMPERV-SG).

These examples demonstrate that negation in Mursi is achieved through bound morphemes (affixes and clitics) that attach directly to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb root.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Majang,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negative Auxiliary and Negative Verb**: The text describes the use of a negative auxiliary ""k-"" which is inflectable and takes the place of the verb in the clause. The lexical negative verb form follows later as a complement to the auxiliary predication. For example:
   - **Example V.85a**: ""nɛ kìr cɛːnà gájɛːL òláːtL bàŋɛ.""
     - Gloss: ""CONJ NEG-3P 3S-DAT succeed-NEG things\NOM all""
     - Translation: ""All things will fail him.""
   - **Example V.85b**: ""nɛ ɔ̀kɔ̀n kí bóŋíːɗǐŋ ...""
     - Gloss: ""CONJ if NEG-3S take-NEG=CND""
     - Translation: ""If she refuses it, …""

2. **Affixation**: The negative auxiliary ""k-"" is prefixed to the verb, and the negative verb form itself is marked with a suffix ""-ɛːL"" (as seen in ""gàj-ɛːL"" for ""succeed-NEG""). This indicates that negation involves both a prefix and a suffix attached to the verb.

3. **Subject Placement**: The subject can appear between the negative auxiliary and the negative verb, or after the negative verb form, indicating flexibility in sentence structure.

4. **Negative Copula and Existential Forms**: The language also uses a negative copula ""mókò"" and a negative existential form ""k-ɛːL"", which function similarly to their affirmative counterparts.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Majang involves the use of an affix (the negative auxiliary ""k-"" and the suffix ""-ɛːL"" on the verb). These markers are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Birri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Birri language, we can analyze the method of standard negation.

1. **Analysis of Negation in Birri:**
   - The text mentions ""ca — sa — sha negative particle, to be found at the end of negative statements."" This indicates that negation in Birri is marked by particles that appear at the end of the sentence.
   - The examples provided in the text also support this:
     - ""They are not many atyone sha.""
     - ""Neg. ini agbb-sa (pr. ina gbb-sa).""

2. **Determining if Negation is Phonologically Bound:**
   - The particles ""ca,"" ""sa,"" and ""sha"" are described as being at the end of negative statements, but there is no explicit indication that these particles are phonologically bound to the verb. They appear to function as separate words (particles) rather than affixes or clitics.
   - The given examples show these particles following the verb but do not demonstrate that they are attached to the verb as affixes or clitics.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine definitively that standard negation in Birri is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negation particles appear to be separate words rather than phonologically bound elements.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tamashek,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The Perfective Negative (PerfN) is formed by adding an ablaut formative that changes ""ae"" in the Perfective Positive (PerfP) to ""e"". This indicates a modification of the verb itself.
   - The PerfN is used after the negative preverbal particle ""wser"", which must directly follow it with no intervening material other than clitics. This suggests that the negation involves both a particle and a modification of the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding a single ablaut formative realized as an ""e"" vowel. This formative is expressed audibly only in light stems ending in ...CaeC-, otherwise, the PerfN is homophonous to the PerfP.
   - The examples provided show verbs where the negation is marked by this vowel change, indicating that the verb itself is modified to express negation.

### Reasoning:

The information provided in the paragraphs clearly indicates that standard negation in Tamashek involves a modification of the verb through an ablaut process. Specifically, the change from ""ae"" to ""e"" in the verb form is a direct modification of the verb to mark negation. This meets the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb, as the negation is not marked by a separate particle alone but involves a change within the verb itself.

### Conclusion:

1

",1,1
Coptic,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Coptic can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the examples provided show negation involving prefixes and suffixes attached to the verb. For instance:

- The negative first present form ""N-G-CWTM AN"" (he is not hearing) involves the prefix ""N-"" and the suffix ""-AN"" attached to the verb ""CWTM"" (to hear).
- The negative first future form ""N-q-NA-CWTM AN"" (he is not going to hear) involves the prefix ""N-"" and the suffix ""-AN"" attached to the verb ""q-NA-CWTM"" (he is going to hear).

These examples demonstrate that negation in Coptic can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for option 1.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraph from ""A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo,"" it is clear that standard negation in Igbo can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Inflectional Suffixes**: The text explicitly mentions ""inflectional suffixes that are inherently negative,"" providing examples such as ""Ejèlà"" (V NEG IMP) meaning ""Do not go!"" and ""Ò dibèghì"" (It be PERF-NEG N) meaning ""It is not yet good."" These examples show that negation is marked directly on the verb through suffixation.

2. **General Negative Suffix**: The paragraph states that ""The General Negative suffix has different morphological realizations that are dialect–specific,"" indicating that negation is achieved through suffixes attached to the verb.

3. **Morphological Negation**: The text asserts that ""Igbo really exhibits morphological negation because the negative markers are part of the derivational morphology of the verb."" This confirms that negation is integrated into the verb morphology, either through affixes or other modifications.

Given these points, it is evident that standard negation in Igbo involves affixes or modifications of the verb, which are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mambai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points relevant to the analysis:

1. **Negation Particles**: The language uses negation particles such as ""yá"" and ""gá"" to mark negation. These particles are not phonologically bound to the verb, as they appear as separate words in the examples given.

2. **Negative Subject Pronouns**: Negation is also marked on Indicative subject pronouns. These pronouns exhibit specific shapes and tonal values when negated, such as ""mìí"" for 1SG:PFV.NEG and ""míì"" for 1SG:NONPFV.NEG. This indicates that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb through the use of these negative subject pronouns.

3. **Summary of Negative Verbal Forms**: The summary table confirms that negative verb forms are marked with negation particles and negative subject pronouns. The presence of negative subject pronouns suggests that negation is integrated into the verb phrase through these pronouns.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by a modification of the verb through the use of negative subject pronouns. This satisfies the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The use of negative subject pronouns (e.g., ""mìí"", ""míì"") indicates that negation is marked by modifying the verb phrase.
- These pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb, as they form a single phonological unit with the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingessana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingessana, the method of standard negation can be analyzed as follows:

1. The negative particle ""wá"" is described as always occurring clause-finally and modifying or negating the preceding verb, verb predicate, or clause. It is explicitly stated that ""wá"" functions similarly to an adverb and can be separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. This indicates that ""wá"" is not phonologically bound to the verb, but rather functions as a separate word (particle).

2. The examples provided further illustrate that ""wá"" is not attached to the verb:
   - In (14a), ""wá"" follows the verb phrase and is separated from the verb by other elements.
   - In (14b), ""wá"" follows an adverb of manner.
   - In (14c), ""wá"" follows a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverb.

Given this information, it is clear that the standard negation in Ingessana is marked by a separate particle ""wá"" that is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Ingessana cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Gorowa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gorowa, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The relevant section (2.6.2.1) explicitly states that verbal negation in Gorowa is accomplished using the negative clitic =ká(ng), which attaches to verb roots that have been extended by the suffix -a in the present tense and -i in the past tense. This indicates that the negation marker forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Examples provided in the grammar further illustrate this:
- In the present tense: ""tam motloo ngi xu’aká"" (She doesn’t even know tomorrow), where =ká is attached to the verb root extended by -a.
- In the past tense: ""inós tunáy ngu xu’iká"" (She didn’t know of dried honey), where =ká is attached to the verb root extended by -i.

These examples confirm that the negative clitic =ká(ng) is phonologically bound to the verb, thus satisfying the condition for marking standard negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1

Koromfe,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negative Particle ""ba""**: The particle ""ba"" is positioned before the verb to negate a sentence. This particle is not phonologically bound to the verb, as it stands as a separate word.

2. **Negative Subject Pronouns**: The language also uses negative subject pronouns, which are proclitics on the verb. These negative pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb, as they attach directly to it. Examples include ""maa"" (1st person singular), ""daa"" (3rd person singular human), and others.

3. **Examples**:
   - (263) ""maa hamandaa ke sa bEllaa"" ('I don't think that he will come back tomorrow.')
   - (264) ""mg hamandaa ke sa daa bElla"" ('I don't think that he will come back tomorrow.')

In these examples, the negative pronouns ""maa"" and ""daa"" are proclitics attached to the verb, indicating that they are phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by a clitic (negative subject pronouns) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative subject pronouns are described as proclitics on the verb, meaning they are phonologically bound to the verb.
- The examples provided show these negative pronouns directly attached to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being phonologically bound.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Nobiin,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nobiin, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Periphrastic Constructions in Old Nobiin**:
   - The negation in Old Nobiin is described as periphrastic, involving the verb ""men-/min-"" meaning 'not to be'. This verb can follow a participle, predicative, or indicative form.
   - Examples provided show the use of ""men-/min-"" in various constructions:
     - Participle Periphrastic: ""iar-il min-il-gu-!"" ('who do not understand')
     - Predicative Periphrastic: ""unn-ara men-na-lo"" ('she did not give birth')
     - Indicative Periphrastic: ""kop-ona men-a"" ('it is not that you ate')

2. **Modern Nobiin**:
   - In Modern Nobiin, the formerly independent verb ""min-/men-"" has evolved into a bound form ""muun-"".
   - The element ""-min/-muun-"" is inserted between the verbal base and the ending, indicating that it has become an affix.
   - Examples of the negative present paradigm show the insertion of ""-muun-"" or ""-min-"":
     - 1SG: ""-muun"" or ""-mun""
     - 2SG: ""-muunam"" or ""-minam""
     - 3SG: ""-muun"" or ""-mun""
     - 1PL: ""-muun"" or ""-munu""
     - 2PL: ""-muunokom"" or ""-munokom""
     - 3PL: ""-muuna"" or ""-min(n)an""

From the information provided, it is clear that in Modern Nobiin, the negation marker ""-muun-"" or ""-min-"" is inserted within the verb structure, making it an affix. This affix is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation marker in Modern Nobiin is an affix (""-muun-"" or ""-min-"") that attaches directly to the verb, modifying it to express negation.
- This affix is phonologically bound to the verb, as it is inserted between the verbal base and the ending.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, we can observe several instances of negation. Here are some key points:

1. The particle ""-de"" is mentioned as being attached to verbs:
   - ""tAde gwesheag"" (They are not fighting)

2. There are examples where negation appears to involve modifications or additions to the verb:
   - ""a fik fedi"" (She has not made food)
   - ""a tai"" (He has not gone)
   - ""fa a telai"" (They have not gone)

3. The text mentions that in the 3rd person, certain modifications occur in negative sentences:
   - ""en a tai?"" (Hasn't he gone?)
   - ""byrer, fe. a tai"" (No, he hasn't)

From these examples, it is clear that negation in Nyimang can involve modifications or additions to the verb, such as the attachment of the particle ""-de"" or other morphological changes.

### Reasoning:
- The particle ""-de"" is explicitly described as being attached to verbs, indicating it is phonologically bound.
- Other examples show modifications to the verb form in negative constructions, suggesting that negation can be marked by changes to the verb itself.

### Conclusion:
1",0,1
Lamé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, it is clear that standard negation is marked using the negative particles ""tsú"" and ""mì"". These particles are not phonologically bound to the verb; instead, they appear as separate words in the sentence structure. ""Tsú"" follows the subject noun or pronoun, and ""mì"" appears at the end of the clause. There is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Reasoning:
1. The negative markers ""tsú"" and ""mì"" are described as particles that are placed in specific positions within the clause but are not bound to the verb. They function independently of the verb and are not affixed or cliticized to it.
2. The examples provided consistently show ""tsú"" and ""mì"" as separate words, not as affixes or clitics attached to the verb.
3. The grammar explicitly states that these particles are used to mark negation and does not mention any other method such as affixation or cliticization to the verb.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Bininj Gun-Wok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bininj Gun-Wok, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted and analyzed:

1. **Negation in Indicatives and Interrogatives**:
   - The text mentions that negation is signaled by a negative particle placed immediately before the verb. This particle is not described as an affix or clitic but as a separate word (particle).
   - Example: ""marrek birri-ngu-yi"" (NEG 3a/3-eat-IRR) translates to ""They didn’t eat it.""

2. **Interaction with Verbal Affixes**:
   - The text states that the negative interacts with a number of verbal affixes to give specific complex meanings. However, it does not specify that the negation itself is marked by an affix or clitic on the verb.
   - Example: ""karri-yawoyh-dulubun"" (NEG 12a/3-again-shootNP) translates to ""We won’t be able to shoot any more flying foxes.""

3. **Negation in Imperatives**:
   - The text describes special negative particles for prohibitives, which combine with the non-past rather than the imperative form of the verb. These particles are also not described as affixes or clitics.
   - Example: ""bayun gorlonj"" (PROHIB 2-talkNP) translates to ""Don’t argue.""

4. **Existential Negation**:
   - Existential negation is expressed by using a privative-suffixed noun as a nominal predicate, not directly related to the standard negation of dynamic verbal predicates.

From the provided information, it is clear that negation in Bininj Gun-Wok is primarily marked by negative particles that precede the verb. These particles are not phonologically bound to the verb (i.e., they are not affixes or clitics). Therefore, standard negation in Bininj Gun-Wok cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 0**

Reasoning:
- The negation is marked by separate particles placed before the verb.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",0,0
Wambaya,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, it appears that standard negation is marked by the use of negative particles ""yangula"" and ""guyala,"" which appear in the initial position of the clause. These particles are not described as affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they function as separate words (particles) that precede the verb and auxiliary constructions.

The examples provided show that the negative particles are followed by verbs and auxiliaries that may contain various tense and mood markers, but there is no indication that the negation itself is marked directly on the verb through affixation, cliticization, or modification of the verb. The negation is achieved through the use of these initial particles, which are separate from the verbs they negate.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Wambaya is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, it is marked by separate negative particles.

**Reasoning:**
1. The negative particles ""yangula"" and ""guyala"" are used to mark negation and appear in the initial position of the clause.
2. These particles are not described as affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.
3. The examples show that the negation is achieved through these particles, which are separate words and not bound morphemes attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Wardaman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation Particles**: The negation in Wardaman is marked by particles such as ""wonggo"" and ""warna"". These particles are used to negate clauses and express meanings of impossibility, prohibition, or constraint.

2. **Examples of Negation**:
   - (420) ""wonggo yingerr-nge-n yingyi lin-yi yayi-la"" translates to ""We may not call his name lest a snake bite him"".
   - (421) ""wonggo yinganu-wo-n warnarr-warang"" translates to ""Don't give me any with fat"".
   - (422) ""wonggo nunu-bu-n-guya"" translates to ""You mustn't kill it"".
   - (423) ""wonggo ngayugu nganu-gomarla-n"" translates to ""You must not follow me"".

3. **Verb Forms**: The verbs in these examples are marked for irrealis and present tense, but the negation itself is introduced by the particles ""wonggo"" or ""warna"".

4. **Phonological Binding**: There is no indication in the provided text that these negation particles are phonologically bound to the verb. They appear to be separate words (particles) that precede the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that the negation in Wardaman is accomplished through the use of separate particles rather than affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself. Therefore, based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Wardaman cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Gooniyandi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, it is clear that the standard negation in Gooniyandi is marked by the particle ""mangaddi."" This particle is used to negate propositions and can appear in various contexts, including modifying a full proposition, modifying a single word referring to a scalable quality or quantity, and as an interjection in responses to questions.

The examples provided show ""mangaddi"" as a separate word that precedes the verb or other elements it negates:

1. ""mangaddi girili-ya-nyali"" (not we:stood)
2. ""mangaddi ganaddaya mangaddi bijginyjawoo"" (not dawn not you:will:come)
3. ""wardbiddi mangaddi mamangooddoo grw"" (they:went not fur close)

In all these instances, ""mangaddi"" functions as a separate particle and does not attach to the verb as an affix or clitic. There is no indication that ""mangaddi"" becomes phonologically bound to the verb or any other word in the sentence.

Therefore, based on the information provided, standard negation in Gooniyandi cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negation is achieved through the use of a separate particle.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negation with Particles**: The text mentions that negation can be achieved using negative particles such as ""arnuka"" or ""karluwu"" (TT) and ""kalu(wu)"" (MT). These particles are described as occurring immediately before the verb or verbal complex. However, they are not described as being phonologically bound to the verb, which suggests that they are separate words rather than affixes or clitics.

2. **Negation with Pronouns**: The text also mentions the use of negative pronouns for negation. These pronouns can appear in both non-verbal and verbal clauses. However, there is no indication that these pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Imperative and Hortatory Negation**: For imperative and hortatory clauses, the negative particle ""ngajiti"" (and its variants ""ngajirri"" or ""ajirri"") is used. These particles are also described as being used with free form verbs, indicating that they are not phonologically bound to the verb.

4. **Absence of Affixes or Clitics**: Throughout the examples and descriptions, there is no mention of negation being marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. The negation is consistently described as being achieved through separate particles or pronouns.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Tiwi is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by separate negative particles or pronouns.

**Reasoning**: The descriptive grammar consistently describes the use of separate negative particles and pronouns for negation, without any indication that these are phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Tiwi cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Nakkara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nakkara, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Identification of Negation Markers:**
   - The text mentions a ""Negative prefix slot preceding the PP"" (Polarity Prefix).
   - It also mentions a ""negative affix /-ma/"" that follows the verb stem in the tense suffix slot.

2. **Phonological Binding:**
   - The negative affix /-ma/ is described as following the verb stem, indicating that it is an affix and thus phonologically bound to the verb.
   - The presence of a ""Negative prefix slot"" suggests that there could be a prefix that attaches to the verb complex, although the specific prefix is not detailed in the provided text.

3. **Irrealis and Negation:**
   - The text states that the palatal segment /*y/ functions as a status marker for irrealis constructions, including negative constructions, and is always accompanied by the negative marker /-ma/ in negative contexts.
   - This indicates that the negative marker /-ma/ is an integral part of the verb complex in negative constructions.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Nakkara involves the use of a negative affix /-ma/ that is phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, the language can mark standard negation through an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Garrwa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negative Particle ""miku""**: The primary method of negation involves the negative particle ""miku"" placed in the initial position of the clause. This particle is followed by second-position clitic elements, which can include pronouns or modal clitics.

2. **Irrealis Verb Forms**: In non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form, marked by the suffix ""-kanyi"". This indicates that the verb form is modified in the context of negation.

3. **Past Negation Clitic ""=ya(nyi)""**: In past contexts, the verb remains unmarked, but the pronoun (if present) takes the clitic ""=ya(nyi)"" to indicate past negation.

4. **Negative Ability Clitic ""=yi""**: To negate ability, the clitic ""=yi"" attaches to pronouns.

5. **Deontic Modal Clitic ""=kiya""**: This clitic can attach to ""miku"" in past contexts to indicate that an event did not happen but should have.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Garrwa involves both modifications of the verb (through the irrealis form ""-kanyi"") and the use of clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb or pronoun (e.g., ""=ya(nyi)"", ""=yi"", ""=kiya""). Therefore, standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The irrealis suffix ""-kanyi"" modifies the verb in non-past negative contexts.
- The clitics ""=ya(nyi)"", ""=yi"", and ""=kiya"" are phonologically bound to pronouns or the negative particle ""miku"" and play a role in marking negation.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Ngankikurungkurr,"1. **Reasoning:**

From the provided paragraphs, we can observe the following:

- In Paragraph 1, the example ""minbe-tye ngemi-kerrety"" (Neg-Past 1sgHands-grip) indicates the presence of a negation marker ""minbe"" which is not attached to the verb but stands as a separate particle.
- In Paragraph 2, the example ""minbe-tye ngana-ne-kuli"" (Neg-Past 1sgFeet-3sg-throw) again shows ""minbe"" as a separate particle for negation.
- There is no evidence in the given paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negation marker ""minbe"" appears to be a separate word.

Given the information, it is clear that the negation marker ""minbe"" is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb based on the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Wagiman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis of Paragraphs

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The negator ""wudyi"" is described as the usual sentential negator.
   - It typically appears in clause-initial position.
   - Examples provided:
     - **Example 10-5:** ""wudyi ga-ya' ganq-ma ga'an lagiban g-~a-ggi yedena""
       - Gloss: ""NEG 3sg:IPFV-tell 1sg OBL-FOC that man 3sg:PFV-go-PAST sneak""
       - Translation: ""(That man) said nothing to me but just sneaked off.""
     - **Example 10-6:** ""wudyi gety gan-ge-0 daganp-gu""
       - Gloss: ""NEG ask-PCT 3sg/lsg-put-PPCT food-DAT""
       - Translation: ""He didn't ask me for food.""
     - **Example 10-7:** ""mdyi ga-nanda-yi ga'an lagiban daty gan-bu-0""
       - Gloss: ""NEG 1sg-see-PAST that man belt-PCT 3sg/lsg-hit-PPCT""
       - Translation: ""I didn't see that man who hit me.""

From these examples, it is clear that the negator ""wudyi"" (or its variant ""mdyi"") is used to negate the proposition expressed in the clause. However, it appears as a separate word in clause-initial position and does not attach to the verb as an affix or clitic. There is no indication that ""wudyi"" or ""mdyi"" is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Wagiman is marked by a separate word (particle) that is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, we cannot conclude that standard negation in Wagiman is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Particle ""la""**: The primary method of negation is the particle ""la,"" which is placed before the verb. This particle is frequently linked to the verb in the same stress group, indicating a close phonological connection. However, it is not explicitly described as an affix or clitic in the provided text.

2. **Phonological Processes**: The text describes phonological processes where the negation particle ""la"" combines with pre-verbal particles like ""i-"" and undergoes changes (e.g., ""le-y-pal6†"" and ""l5-pal6†""). These processes suggest that the negation particle can form a phonological unit with the verb, but it is not definitively described as an affix or clitic.

3. **Examples**: The examples provided (e.g., ""la-pál6†,"" ""le-y-mbáqri"") show the negation particle preceding the verb and forming a phonological unit with it. However, the description does not explicitly state that ""la"" is an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

Given the information, it is clear that the negation particle ""la"" is closely linked to the verb and can form a phonological unit with it. However, the text does not provide definitive evidence that ""la"" is an affix or clitic as defined by the guidelines (i.e., phonologically bound to the verb).

**Reasoning**: The negation particle ""la"" is described as being closely linked to the verb and forming a phonological unit with it, but it is not explicitly described as an affix or clitic. Therefore, based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to definitively determine that standard negation in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",1,0
English,"1. The paragraphs provided from the descriptive grammar of English indicate that standard negation can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb. Specifically, the text describes two forms of negation: analytic and synthetic. 

- Analytic negation involves adding the word ""not"" after the auxiliary verb (e.g., ""Kim will not be here later on"").
- Synthetic negation involves a contracted form where the negation is marked by a suffix attached to the auxiliary verb (e.g., ""Kim won’t be here later on"").

The synthetic form, such as ""won’t,"" ""didn’t,"" and ""doesn’t,"" clearly shows that the negation is marked by an inflectional suffix (e.g., -n’t) that is phonologically bound to the verb. This suffix is described as a verbal suffix, indicating that it is an inflectional modification of the verb itself.

Given this information, it is clear that English uses a phonologically bound suffix to mark negation in some cases, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Korean,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can analyze the methods of standard negation as follows:

1. **Short Negative**:
   - The short negative form is created by preposing the negative adverb ""an(i)"" before the verb. For example:
     - ""Ponta"" (to see) becomes ""An(i) ponta"" (does not see).
     - ""Coh.ta"" (to like) becomes ""An(i) coh.ta"" (does not like).

2. **Long Negative**:
   - The long negative form involves attaching the negative auxiliary ""anh-"" to the verb stem. For example:
     - ""Ponta"" (to see) becomes ""Poci ani hanta"" (does not see).
     - ""Coh.ta"" (to like) becomes ""Coh.ci ani hanta"" (does not like).

From this information, we can determine that standard negation in Korean can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the long negative form involves attaching the auxiliary ""anh-"" to the verb stem, which qualifies as an affix.

### Reasoning:
- The short negative form uses a negative adverb ""an(i)"" that is not phonologically bound to the verb, so it does not meet the criteria.
- The long negative form, however, uses the auxiliary ""anh-"" attached to the verb stem, which is a clear example of an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Basque,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Basque:

1. The paragraph describes how the presence of negation affects the word order in Basque finite clauses. Specifically, it mentions that the auxiliary verb merges with the negation and precedes the lexical verb (example 1070: ""Etxea ez da erori"").
2. The negation ""ez"" appears to be a separate particle that precedes the auxiliary verb ""da"" and the lexical verb ""erori"". There is no indication that ""ez"" is an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
3. The description does not mention any modification of the verb itself or the use of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation.

Given this information, it appears that standard negation in Basque is marked by a separate particle ""ez"" rather than by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Malayalam,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - **8.29.2:** ""Negative is formed by the addition of ie§y after the tense marker. When it is added the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero. He does not do anything.""

This paragraph clearly indicates that the negative marker ""ie§y"" is added after the tense marker. The fact that it is added after the tense marker and causes a phonological change (the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero) suggests that it is an affix or a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:

- The description specifies that the negative marker ""ie§y"" is added after the tense marker, which implies that it is attached to the verb.
- The phonological change (the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero) further supports that the negative marker is not a separate word but is instead bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:

1. The evidence from the provided paragraph indicates that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iu Mien, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Particle**: The primary method of negation in Iu Mien is through the use of the particle ""maiv"" /mai˦˥˧/ or its contracted form ""mv"" /m̩ ˦˥˧/. This particle is placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs to indicate negation.

2. **Phonological Boundaries**: The particle ""maiv"" and its contracted form ""mv"" are described as separate words that precede the verb. There is no indication that these particles are phonologically bound to the verb as affixes or clitics. They are described as particles that can be contracted in rapid and colloquial speech, but this contraction does not imply that they become affixes or clitics bound to the verb.

3. **Examples**: The examples provided show ""maiv"" and ""mv"" as separate particles preceding the verb:
   - (861-3) ""lorz maiv buatc"" (seek NEG see) - ""and yet didn’t find any.""
   - (862-3) ""Yie mbuo yaac mv buatc"" (1PL TOPCNTRST NEG see) - ""As far as we are concerned, we didn’t see (as they said though).""

4. **Conclusion**: The negation particles ""maiv"" and ""mv"" are not affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. They function as separate particles that precede the verb to indicate negation. Therefore, standard negation in Iu Mien cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Semelai, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negation Marker ""da?""**: The primary negator in Semelai is ""da?"" which is used to negate both verbal and non-verbal predicates. The examples provided show that ""da?"" precedes the verb or the predicate it negates. For instance:
   - (224) ""da? ?yot kdhn ke"" (He didn't return)
   - (226) ""da? ki=j?Dy sijkalan"" (He didn't make a grinding board)
   - (227) ""da? ji=sd*r?"" (Don't you remember (it)?)

2. **Position and Function**: The negator ""da?"" always occupies the predicate-initial position, directly preceding the verb or the predicate. This positioning indicates that ""da?"" is a separate word (particle) rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

3. **No Evidence of Phonological Binding**: There is no indication in the provided text that ""da?"" is phonologically bound to the verb. It functions as a separate particle that precedes the verb but does not attach to it as an affix or clitic.

4. **Other Negators**: The text also mentions other negators like ""beh"" and ""b?en,"" but these are used in different contexts (metalinguistic negation) and are not described as being phonologically bound to the verb either.

Given the information provided, it is clear that the standard negation in Semelai is marked by a separate particle ""da?"" that precedes the verb but is not phonologically bound to it. Therefore, standard negation in Semelai cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), it is clear that standard negation in this language is marked by a prefix attached to the finite verb. The examples provided illustrate the use of the prefix ""el+"" to indicate negation:

- ""el+jan-ni"" (NEG+send-3PL:INTR) translates to 'They did not let me go there.'
- ""el+jaqa-te-je"" (NEG+achieve-FUT-INTR:1SG) translates to 'I will not reach the house.'
- ""el+keb-ej-te-jek"" (NEG+go-PFV-FUT-INTR:2SG) translates to 'You will not go away from here.'
- ""el+lej"" (NEG+eat(NEG:3SG)) translates to 'That dog did not eat that.'

These examples demonstrate that the negation marker ""el+"" is a prefix that attaches directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Georgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The key evidence comes from the use of the negation marker ""ar"" in conjunction with the verb forms. For example:

- ""gvino ar (Ø-)e-sm-ev-a"" (wine(NOM) not (X-)IOV-drink-TS-it) translates to 'X cannot drink wine'.
- ""šen-s dge-ši ar ša-mo-(Ø-)m-rč-en-i-x-a+r"" (your-AGR day-in not PREV-PREV-(you-)me-lag.behind-TS-PERFyou-be) translates to 'In your day you did not fall short of me in battle'.

In these examples, ""ar"" is used as a negation marker that is directly associated with the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb phrase. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Alutor,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Alutor employs several methods for marking negation, some of which involve affixes or modifications of the verb. Specifically:

- Type (1) mentions the use of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb, but it does not specify if this particle is phonologically bound to the verb.
- Type (2) involves the combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative, and it mentions the possibility of reduction where the negative particle is absent, implying a modification of the verb form itself.
- Type (4) describes an analytical form derived from the negative analytical representation of the lexical verb, which includes the use of a negative particle.
- Type (5) explicitly mentions the use of circumfixes (tymNi-...-a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in), which are affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Given the information, it is clear that at least some forms of negation in Alutor involve affixes or modifications of the verb. Specifically, the use of circumfixes in Type (5) confirms that negation can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Thai, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Thai.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1 (Lesson 2. A. 1. (a))**:
   - It mentions that a negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of the verb or, in certain cases, after it. This suggests that negation is achieved through the use of negative words (particles) rather than affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2 (Lesson 7. A. 1. (c))**:
   - This paragraph provides more specific examples of negation in Thai. It states that ""MY DY"" placed in front of the verb means ""did not"" and is widely used. For example:
     - **CHUN MY DY PY**: ""I did not go.""
   - Here, ""MY"" is the negative word, and ""DY"" is used to indicate past tense. The negative word ""MY"" is placed before the verb, and there is no indication that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:

- The provided paragraphs indicate that negation in Thai is achieved by placing a negative word (particle) before or after the verb. There is no mention of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself for marking standard negation.
- The negative word ""MY"" is described as a separate word (particle) that precedes the verb, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Thai is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the appropriate response is:

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Nganasan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nganasan, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Negative Auxiliary**: The default way to negate a sentence in Nganasan is through the use of the negative auxiliary **ńisɨ**.
2. **Connegative Marker**: The negated verb takes the connegative marker **-ʔ**.
3. **Inflection and Agreement**: The negative auxiliary **ńisɨ** takes mood and tense markers, inflectional suffixes, and agrees with the subject in person and number, and with the object in number if it is lexically covert.
4. **Suppletive Form**: The connegative form of the verb **isʲa** ‘be’ is suppletive: **ŋuəɁ**.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Nganasan involves both a negative auxiliary and a connegative marker that attaches to the verb. The connegative marker **-ʔ** is an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The connegative marker **-ʔ** is an affix that attaches to the verb, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.
- The negative auxiliary **ńisɨ** also plays a role in negation, but the presence of the connegative marker **-ʔ** on the verb itself satisfies the criterion for marking standard negation through an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1

Thus, standard negation in Nganasan can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.",0,1
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

1. **Supine Construction for Negation**:
   - The supine form is used for non-future negation in the Amur variety, as seen in the examples:
     - ""prә-dox q'au-yitle"" (come-SUP not_exist-naturally) translates to ""naturally, he didn't come"".
     - ""prә-dә-lәyә-yitle"" (come-even-lack-naturally) translates to ""naturally, he didn't come"".
   - These examples show that the supine form of the verb is used in conjunction with other elements to express negation.

2. **Suffix for Negation**:
   - The text mentions that ""Negation is otherwise expressed with the suffix given in table 1.7; see also chapter 6.4.""
   - Although the specific suffix is not detailed in the provided text, the mention of a suffix for negation indicates that there is a morphological marker that attaches to the verb to indicate negation.

3. **Example with Habitual Negative Suffix**:
   - The example ""siḑhagin-nә-j-xsu-r"" (anything-do-EXPL-NEG.HAB-CV:3s) translates to ""he does not do anything but sleep"".
   - Here, the suffix ""-xsu-"" is used to mark habitual negation, which is attached to the verb.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) can be marked by a suffix that is phonologically bound to the verb. This satisfies the criteria for marking negation via an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Jarawa (in Andamans),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, it is clear that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix on the verb. Specifically, the suffix {-ma} is used to negate the verb directly, as demonstrated in the example (4.67):

(4.67) uʈʰa allema-ma
Uʈʰa come-NEG
'Uʈʰa did not come.'

This indicates that the negation marker {-ma} is an affix that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Therefore, standard negation in Jarawa can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The suffix {-ma} is explicitly described as a means to negate the verb in Jarawa.
2. The example (4.67) clearly shows the negation marker {-ma} attached to the verb allema 'come', forming a phonological unit.
3. The description specifies that the suffix {-ma} replaces other suffixal markings on the verb, further confirming its role as an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nahali,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nahali, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Affixation and Cliticization**: The negative markers such as ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:ṭo"" can occur either before or after the verb. When they occur before the verb, they sometimes undergo assimilatory changes, which indicates that they can be phonologically bound to the verb. For example:
  - ""jo beṭhe ha:goken"" (I neg laugh-pr) ‘I do not laugh’.
  - ""jo ho:ṭo ha:go ḍa:n"" (I neg laugh-pp) ‘I had not laughed’.

- **Modification of the Verb**: The negative markers can cause modifications in the verb form, such as gemination of the first consonant of the verb when ""beṭhe"" precedes it:
  - ""kyamp jo beppa:ṭo"" (tomorrow I not come –pr) ‘tomorrow I will not come’.
  - ""inginki sokra bebbe"" (we-to food neg-give) ‘we are not given food’.

- **Bound Forms**: The negative marker ""beṭhe"" can be followed by a bound form ""-la"" for emphasis, indicating that it can be phonologically bound:
  - ""jo masto beṭhe"" (I good/fine neg) ‘I am not fine’.
  - ""parayki joppo hey beṭhe:la"" (river-in water be neg) ‘there is no water in the river’.

Given these examples, it is evident that standard negation in Nahali can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kusunda,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kusunda, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. The paragraphs describe the use of a suffix to mark negation in Kusunda. Specifically, the suffix -aÚu is used to mark negative realis assertion in Class II verbs, as shown in the examples provided:
   - tsi e-d-a u (I give-1-NEG) ‘I did not give.’
   - tok e-d-a u (we give-1-NEG) ‘We did not give.’
   - nu e-n-a u (you give-2-NEG) ‘You did not give.’
   - nok e-n-a u (you.pl give-2-NEG) ‘You [pl] did not give.’
   - gina e-g-a u (he/she give-3-NEG) ‘He/she did not give.’

2. The suffix -daÚu is also mentioned as marking negative realis in Class I verbs for all persons. This indicates that the negation marker is indeed an affix that attaches to the verb.

3. The description clearly states that the negative suffix is part of the verb morphology, and the examples provided show that the negation marker is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Udihe,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, it is clear that standard negation in Udihe can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Udihe uses a negative auxiliary verb ""e-/ei-"" which precedes the content verb and takes various morphological forms. This auxiliary verb is bound to the verb and reflects the role of the predicate in the sentence. Examples such as ""ei-mi"" (NEG-1SG) in ""Bi ei-mi sa:."" (I don't know) and ""e-ini"" (NEG-3SG) in ""Ine'i e-ini yene."" (The dog is not walking) demonstrate that the negation is indeed marked by a bound morpheme attached to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingush,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Negation Marking**: The text explicitly states that ""Negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush."" This indicates that the negation marker is directly associated with the verb, which is crucial for determining if it is phonologically bound.

2. **Types of Negation Markers**: The negative morpheme can be either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form:
   - **Suffix**: Used for tense forms.
   - **Proclitic cy**: Used for converbs and nonfinites.
   - **Proclitic my**: Used for imperatives.

3. **Examples**:
   - Example (1): ""Xaa-c suona=m."" (know-NEG 1s.DAT=FOC) translates to ""I don't know."" Here, the negation is marked by the suffix ""-c"" attached to the verb ""Xaa"" (know).
   - Example (2): ""qy suona vaala=m vaala-ndz-ar sag"" (any more 1s.DAT V.RED=FOC V.go-NEG-WP anyone) translates to ""No one else got in front of me (in line)."" The negation is marked by the suffix ""-ndz-ar"" attached to the verb ""vaala"" (go).
   - Example (3): ""Nuu cy hwaqacha ladar chy-doalar"" (broom NEG sweep.CVtemp leak in-D.go.IMPF) translates to ""If you didn't sweep it water would leak in."" The negation is marked by the proclitic ""cy"" attached to the converb ""hwaqacha"" (sweep).
   - Example (4): ""Veina magha sag my vaaliitalaa"" (1pIN.DAT ahead anyone NEG V.go-CSind.IMPVmild) translates to ""Don't let anyone in ahead of us."" The negation is marked by the proclitic ""my"" attached to the imperative ""vaaliitalaa"" (go).

4. **Conclusion**: The negation markers in Ingush are either suffixes or proclitic particles that are phonologically bound to the verb. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Lezgian,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can determine the following:

1. **Finite indicative verb forms** are negated by means of the suffix **-δ**. For example, the verb ""guzwa"" (gives) becomes ""guzwa-c"" (does not give). This indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix, which is an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Non-finite and non-indicative verb forms** are negated by prefixal negation. This involves either a periphrastic construction with the negative auxiliary ""t-awun"" (not do) or a negative prefix ""t(A)-"" for a closed set of verbs. For example, ""awun"" (do) becomes ""t-awun"" (not do), and ""xun"" (give birth) becomes ""ta-xun"" (not give birth). This indicates that negation can also be marked by a prefix, which is another type of affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Lezgian can be marked by an affix (either a suffix or a prefix) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Galo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Affixation of Negation:**
   - The examples provided show that the negation marker `-máa` is suffixed to the verb. For instance:
     - (611) `bɨ ̂ɨ câaku má` (3.SG ascend-CMPL-NEG) translates to ‘He or she doesn’t go up anymore.’
     - (612) `bɨ ̂ɨ caakù maadù` (3.SG ascend-CMPL-NEG-IRR) translates to ‘He or she won’t go up anymore (his or her going up will cease).’
     - (613) `bɨ ̂ɨ caamâa rəkú` (3.SG ascend-NEG-IRR-CMPL) translates to ‘He or she’ll come to no longer go up (his or her state of not-going-up will come to pass).’

2. **Position in Predicate Inflectional Paradigm:**
   - The schematic in Figure 12.1 indicates that `-máa` is a negative suffix that is part of the predicate inflectional paradigm. It is listed alongside other inflectional markers such as the completive `-kú`.

3. **Obligatory Suffixation:**
   - The text explicitly states that ""Final predicates in negative polarity are obligatorily suffixed in `-máa`.""

Given this information, it is clear that the negation marker `-máa` is an affix that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verbal root.

**Reasoning:**
- The negation marker `-máa` is described as a suffix that attaches directly to the verb, which qualifies as an affix according to the guidelines provided.
- The examples provided show consistent use of `-máa` as a suffix in negative constructions involving dynamic verbal predicates.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), it is clear that standard negation in this language can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. The text describes various negative suffixes (VVn) that attach directly to the verb, such as |-nћլit-| meaning 'not', |-at-| meaning 'not', and others like |-nћլiћլ-| meaning 'no longer'. These suffixes are explicitly stated to be part of the verb morphology, indicating that negation is marked by modifications or affixation to the verb itself.

For example:
- In sentence (2): ""kiu-nrit-uq"" (he did not answer), the suffix |-nrit-| is attached to the verb root |kiu-| (to answer).
- In sentence (3): ""tange-nrrit-uq"" (he did not see), the suffix |-nrrit-| is attached to the verb root |tange-| (to see).

These examples demonstrate that negation is marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, satisfying the criteria for standard negation as defined.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yuki,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, it is evident that standard negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative marker ""-ṭan"" is used as a suffix to negate verbs, as shown in examples (103), (104), and (105):

- Example (103): ""mu:šakṭanpaˀ"" (laugh-SEM-NEG-FUT) translates to ""He’s not gonna laugh.""
- Example (104): ""kiˀ ˀi hąw č a:niṭan"" (DST 1SG.PAT fish give-NEG) translates to ""He won’t give that fish to me.""
- Example (105): ""m ú:šamtanmil"" (laugh-IMPFV-NEG=FIN) translates to ""However Spider did not laugh.""

These examples clearly demonstrate that the negative marker ""-ṭan"" is an affix that attaches directly to the verb, thereby forming a phonological unit with it.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Pipil,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is clear that Pipil uses particles for negation, specifically ""te:"", ""tesu"", and ""inte"". The paragraph explicitly states that there is ""no ready evidence of any negative affixes"" in Pipil. This indicates that negation in Pipil is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb but rather by separate particles.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph mentions that Pipil uses the negative particles ""te:"", ""tesu"", and ""inte"".
2. It explicitly states that there is ""no ready evidence of any negative affixes"" in Pipil.
3. The examples provided for negation in Pipil (e.g., ""tesu ta-kwa"") show that the negative marker is a separate word (particle) and not an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Pipil cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Micmac can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. The paragraph specifically discusses the negative forms of intransitive verbs in Micmac. It provides examples of negative forms such as ""welagapiw,"" ""welagapiwun,"" ""welagapinugw,"" and others.
2. The paragraph identifies the negative morpheme as ""-w-"" (or its variant forms), which appears to follow the dual or plural number morpheme and precedes the person markers. This indicates that the negative morpheme is integrated within the verb structure.
3. The description suggests that the negative morpheme is phonologically bound to the verb, as it is inserted within the verb morphology and interacts with other morphemes such as number and person markers.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Micmac involves a morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb, either as an affix or a modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tepehua (Huehuetla), it is clear that standard negation is marked by the negative particle ""jaantu"" (or its truncated form ""tuu""). This particle precedes the verb and is not phonologically bound to it as an affix or clitic. The examples provided show ""jaantu"" and ""tuu"" occurring as separate words before the verb, indicating that they function as particles rather than affixes or clitics.

For instance:
- ""maa jaantu laay 7alin s-7asqat'a-7an"" (He/she can not have children.)
- ""juu p'ulhnan tuu laay 7ixchiwinin juu maqalhqama7 juu lhii-laawaan naa qox"" (At first, the Tepehua could not speak Spanish very well.)

These examples demonstrate that the negation is achieved through a separate particle that precedes the verb, rather than through a modification of the verb or a phonologically bound affix/clitic.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Musqueam, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. In the examples provided, negation appears to be marked directly on the verb through the use of specific morphemes. For instance:
   - ""?Swa"" is used as a negative marker in several examples, such as ""?Swa lém-21"" ('I don't go'), ""?Swa lém-os"" ('He/She/It doesn't/won't go'), and ""?Swa lém-et"" ('We don't/won't go').
   - The negative marker ""?Swa"" is consistently attached to the verb forms, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. The presence of the negative marker directly attached to the verb forms suggests that negation is achieved through a modification of the verb or an affix.

3. The examples show that the negative marker is not a separate particle but rather an integral part of the verb phrase, which aligns with the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Omaha, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negating Particle ""bazhi""**:
   - The text mentions the use of the negating particle ""bazhi"" to declare that somebody did not do something. This particle is placed after the verb.
   - Example: ""To declare that somebody did not do something, we place the negating particle bazhi after the verb.""

2. **Ablaut Before ""Not""**:
   - The text also discusses an ablaut process where an -e verb changes to -a before the negating particle ""azhi"" in commands.
   - Example: ""In a command, a preceding -e verb ablauts to -a before the negating particle azhi.""

From these points, we can infer the following:

- The negating particle ""bazhi"" is not phonologically bound to the verb as it is placed after the verb as a separate word.
- The ablaut process before the negating particle ""azhi"" in commands indicates a modification of the verb itself, which is a phonological change directly related to negation.

Given that the ablaut process involves a modification of the verb to mark negation, this fits the criteria for standard negation being marked by a modification of the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The ablaut process described involves a direct modification of the verb form in the context of negation.
- This modification is a phonological change that occurs specifically for negation, indicating that standard negation can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:

Washo,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can extract some information about the negation in Washo. The paragraph mentions a ""Negative suffix"" -hé*s, which suggests that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb. This indicates that negation in Washo can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Here's the relevant excerpt from the paragraph:
> ""When -é*s Negative not apply to Usitative the morpheme, (see section ef the associated as is generally true by ~i Imperfect, with further nominalization or adverbialization Very characteristic are phrases usually ‘as, @ form of a verb -dun with take an adverbializing like, and are followed and generalized is in keeping with custom the examples given below show this, of section which is there usual’, but might and so is is aiso followed Imperfect in eats followed turn say', meaning, question sutfix 'to so', in usual jy id in nominalized, &? the or foliowed dof, as the examples). or we of statement negative -—duk @liy 2.""

From this, we can infer that the negative suffix -hé*s is used to mark negation on the verb, which qualifies as an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph explicitly mentions a ""Negative suffix"" -hé*s.
2. Suffixes are affixes that attach to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.
3. This fits the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Koasati,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, it is evident that standard negation can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. The paragraph mentions the use of a ""negative cross-referencing morpheme"" and a ""person negative suffix"" which are attached to the verb. Specifically, the suffix -@:pi- is described as forming a complex with the deductive suffix -i-, indicating that it is suffixed to nouns and verbs to convey negation.
2. Examples provided in the text show the use of these suffixes in negation:
   - ""Isstats-FALL-3neg(2A)-modal-Past"" in the gloss for ""caténkazpit"" translates to ""I almost didn’t fall.""
   - ""3neg(1A)-HEAR-neg:comp-ss"" in the gloss for ""okéliskan sénkon fayléhpok"" indicates the use of a negative suffix in the verb construction.
3. The text explicitly states that the negative morpheme follows the element to be negated, which is typical of affixation.

Given these points, it is clear that Koasati uses affixes or modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Chumash (Barbareño),"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Chumash (Barbareño), it is evident that standard negation can be marked by a prefix that attaches to the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Negation Prefix**: The paragraph explicitly states that the prefix ""e-"" marks negation and precedes all other prefixes except person, number, and ""2al-"" (stative). This indicates that negation is directly marked on the verb through a prefix.

2. **Examples of Negation**:
   - **Example (146)**: ""s-iy-e-sili-nah-was"" (3-PL-N-DES-go-PST) translates to ""they didn’t want to go."" Here, the negation prefix ""e-"" is attached to the verb root ""sili"" (go).
   - **Example (148)**: ""s-e-gili-saqutihan"" (3-N-HAB-tell.a.story) translates to ""he would never tell any stories."" The negation prefix ""e-"" is attached to the verb root ""gili"" (tell a story).
   - **Example (149)**: ""s-e-nono?"" (3-N-much) translates to ""they didn’t use a carreta very much."" The negation prefix ""e-"" is attached to the verb root ""nono?"" (use).

These examples clearly show that the negation prefix ""e-"" is phonologically bound to the verb, marking negation directly on the verb itself.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation marker ""e-"" is described as a prefix, which is an affix that attaches to the verb.
- The examples provided demonstrate the use of this prefix in negating dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Yuchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negation Section**: The grammar explicitly mentions that Yuchi has two negative pre-clitics, n2- and h&-. The negative pre-clitic n2- is noted as the most productive today.
2. **Attachment to Verb**: The text specifies that the negative pre-clitic n2- can be attached to the verb. When attached to the verb, it has scope over the verb and therefore the sentence or clause.

Example (60a) demonstrates this:
- **Sentence**: Di dziosh'i'zci 'ahe nedzo hetede.
- **Gloss**: 1SG I SG(A).POSS-C~~~-CL(SIT) there NEG-1SG.bringWARN
- **Translation**: 'I had better not bring my coat.'

From this information, it is clear that the negative pre-clitic n2- attaches directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negative pre-clitic n2- is phonologically bound to the verb when marking negation.
- The example provided shows the clitic attached to the verb, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not possible to determine the method of standard negation in Alsea. The paragraph mentions a ""particle of negation"" but does not provide sufficient information about whether this particle is phonologically bound to the verb or not. There is no mention of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb related to negation in the given text.

1. The paragraph only briefly mentions a ""particle of negation"" without elaborating on its phonological properties or its relationship with the verb. Therefore, it is unclear whether the negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Arikara. Here are the relevant points extracted from the text:

1. The text mentions the indicative prefix and a negative prefix that replaces it, indicating that negation involves a prefix.
2. Examples such as ""Ahnaanoéku’"" (I’m not singing) and ""TAxciikaéhu’"" (You’re not crying) show a transformation from an affirmative to a negative form by changing the prefix.

Given these points, it is clear that negation in Arikara involves a prefix that is phonologically bound to the verb. This prefix is an affix, as it attaches directly to the verb and modifies its meaning to express negation.

### Reasoning:
- The text explicitly mentions a negative prefix that replaces the indicative prefix, indicating that the negation is marked by an affix.
- The examples provided show the transformation of verbs from affirmative to negative forms by changing the prefix, further supporting the use of an affix for negation.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Takelma,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, it is clear that standard negation in the language is marked by the negative adverb ""wede,"" which is used to negate future and imperative forms. The examples provided show that ""wede"" is a separate word that precedes the verb, rather than an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. There is no indication that ""wede"" becomes phonologically bound to the verb or that the verb undergoes any morphological change to indicate negation.

For instance:
- ""yana’t'e"" (I shall go) becomes ""wede yana’t'e"" (I shall not go).
- ""d6“ma‘nk‘"" (he will kill him) becomes ""wede d6“ma‘nk‘"" (he will not kill him).

Since ""wede"" is a separate particle and not an affix or clitic that attaches to the verb, and there is no modification of the verb itself to indicate negation, we can conclude that standard negation in Takelma is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Jemez,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The verb structure in Jemez includes a negative prefix /W&/ as one of its possible components. This prefix is listed among other verb constituents like pronominal prefixes, incorporated elements, verb stems, and inflectional suffixes. The inclusion of the negative prefix in this list suggests that it is an integral part of the verb structure and is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (155b) shows the use of the negative prefix in a verb construction:
     ```
     'He did not wake up.'
     (neg iben[3sg]-neg-reWpl-wake.up/pf)
     ```
     Here, the negative prefix /wf/ is used within the verb complex, indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb itself. The prefix is placed between the pronominal prefix and the verb stem, showing that it is indeed phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The presence of the negative prefix /W&/ in the verb structure and its use in the provided example (155b) clearly indicate that standard negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The negative prefix is an integral part of the verb complex, fulfilling the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Zuni,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Zuni involves a negative verb stem suffix. This is evident from multiple examples where the negation is marked directly on the verb with a suffix. For instance, in the example (8):

```
ka’ 'a:w-okyaccik’ te'le’ k'oSo-na:w-amme-'kya
neg. pl.-woman pot wash-pl.subj.-neg.-past
‘The women didn't wash a pot.’
```

Here, the suffix `-amme` is used to mark negation on the verb `k'oSo` (wash). Similarly, in example (31b):

```
Pilpo ka’ hot ky'akYen tana ‘a3-nam-kya
Filbert neg. indef. house large make-neg.-past
‘Filbert did not build a large house.’
```

The suffix `-nam` is used to mark negation on the verb `‘a3` (make). Additionally, paragraph 3 explicitly states that ""a negative verb stem suffix"" is required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, further confirming that negation is marked by an affix on the verb.

Given this consistent evidence of a negative suffix attached to the verb, it is clear that standard negation in Zuni can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Rama, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. The negative imperative form ""arka"" is mentioned as a negative form.
2. The forms ""taama"" and its variant ""tahma"" are described as negative forms.
3. The suffixation of ""taama"" is explicitly shown in examples like ""naas kami-taama"" (I don't sleep) and ""i-sik-taama"" (he did not arrive).
4. The suffix ""taama"" is described as being suffixed to the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that the negation in Rama can be marked by a suffix that attaches to the verb. This suffixation process is evident in the examples provided, where ""taama"" is directly attached to the verb to indicate negation.

### Reasoning:
- The suffix ""taama"" is used to mark negation and is attached to the verb, forming a phonological unit with the verb root.
- The examples provided clearly show the negation marker as a bound morpheme (suffix) attached to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tonkawa,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Tonkawa, it is clear that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix. Specifically, the paragraph describes the use of the suffix ""-abe-"" to form the negative of any verb. This suffix is added directly to the verb theme, and its initial vowel ""-a-"" can obscure the form of the final theme element. Additionally, the suffix's vowel is lengthened when the verb takes a second person object.

Here are the relevant points from the paragraph:

1. The negative suffix ""-abe-"" is added directly to the verb theme.
2. The suffix can be inserted between the theme and other elements, such as the second person object.
3. Examples provided in the text show the suffix ""-abe-"" being used to negate verbs:
   - ""yagb-ab-o'c"" (I do not hit him)
   - ""geigab-ab-o'"" (he does not hit me)
   - ""yagb-abe-no'c"" (I am not hitting him)
   - ""yagb-abe-nec'o'c"" (we two do not hit him)

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Tonkawa involves a suffix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negative Postfixes**: The text explicitly mentions the use of negative postfixes -aha and -k?aha for forming negative paradigms of active verbs. These postfixes are added to the verb forms to indicate negation.
   - Example: ""lo’tawehe"" (he did not run) is formed from ""lo’tawi"" (he ran) + ""-aha"".
   - Example: ""lo’tawik?aha"" (he does not run) is formed from ""lo’tawi"" (he ran) + ""-k?aha"".

2. **Affixation**: The negative markers -aha and -k?aha are described as postfixes, which are a type of affix. They are bound morphemes that attach to the verb forms to indicate negation.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Tunica can be marked by an affix (postfix) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negative markers -aha and -k?aha are explicitly described as postfixes, which are affixes.
- These postfixes are added directly to the verb forms to create negative constructions.
- The examples provided show that these postfixes are used to negate dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Wappo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wappo, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

**Paragraph 1:**
This paragraph does not provide information about negation. It mainly discusses possessive pronouns, objective forms, reflexive and semi-passive constructions, and various prefixes related to actions and directions.

**Paragraph 2:**
This paragraph contains relevant information about negation in Wappo. It states:

> ""The Negative
> This is regularly formed by the postposition of la'ki, which is composed of la, not, and a suffix of unknown force which also appears with kaki, cannot. la'ki has the same effect upon the preceding verb-stem as the subordinating suffixes -tsel, -kwen and frequently causes them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This fact, taken together with other indications, suggests that -ki is the general verbalizer.""

From this, we can infer that the negation in Wappo involves the postposition ""la'ki,"" which is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix ""-ki."" The description indicates that ""la'ki"" affects the preceding verb-stem, causing it to lose the vowel of its tense-aspect suffixes. This interaction suggests that ""la'ki"" forms a phonological unit with the verb, indicating that it is bound to the verb.

**Paragraph 3:**
This paragraph does not provide additional information about negation. It discusses various locative and causal constructions.

### Reasoning:

The key information is found in Paragraph 2, which describes the negation marker ""la'ki."" The description indicates that ""la'ki"" is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix ""-ki,"" and it affects the verb-stem by causing it to lose the vowel of its tense-aspect suffixes. This behavior suggests that ""la'ki"" is phonologically bound to the verb, either as an affix or a clitic.

### Conclusion:
1

The standard negation in Wappo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Ute,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is evident that standard negation in Ute can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. The descriptive grammar mentions several negative elements that are used to negate verbs, specifically:

1. **Absolute negatives in -apa-**:
   - Example: ""imi'ntcaaijA qa p-A'qa'-ijudp-A"" (thou-preterit-him (vis.) not kill-negative, you did not kill him)
   - Here, the negative suffix ""-apa-"" is attached to the verb.

2. **Non-absolute negatives in -ywa'ai-**:
   - Example: ""rii' qatcu'arjA qa'(uir)wa'a"" (I not-him (vis.) sing.-cause-negative, I do not let him sing)
   - The negative suffix ""-ywa'ai-"" is used with the verb.

3. **Future negative suffixes -rjwa'ai- to -va·-**:
   - Example: ""qatcu'A'qa-ijA p\ni'k aiwTfwain i"" (he (vis.) will not see it (vis.))
   - The negative suffix ""-rjwa'ai-"" is inserted between future tense markers.

These examples clearly show that negation in Ute involves the use of suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative markers ""-apa-"", ""-ywa'ai-"", and ""-rjwa'ai-"" are described as suffixes that attach directly to the verb.
- These suffixes form a phonological unit with the verbal root, indicating that negation is marked by affixation.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. The key information is found in section 8.2, which discusses negation using ""mos"" and ""neemee.""

1. **Negation with ""neemee"":**
   - The preverb ""neemee"" is used before the verb to indicate negation. This is evident in examples such as:
     - ""Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’."" (I don’t feel well.)
     - ""Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet."" (It’s not very windy here.)
   - ""Neemee"" is described as a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Negation with ""mos"":**
   - ""Mos"" is described as an emphatic negative particle that occurs at the beginning of a sentence and is not phonologically bound to the verb. Examples include:
     - ""Mos kol’ soosek’."" (I’m not thinking about anything.)
     - ""Mos cheetaa wo pahchew."" (It was not moving at all.)

Given this information, ""neemee"" functions as a preverb that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This qualifies as a method of standard negation that involves an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The preverb ""neemee"" is used to mark negation and is phonologically bound to the verb, fitting the criteria for standard negation involving an affix or clitic.
- Although ""mos"" is a particle and not phonologically bound to the verb, the presence of ""neemee"" as a bound preverb is sufficient to determine that Yurok uses a method of standard negation that involves modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Nuuchahnulth,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, we can analyze the examples to determine if standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Analysis of Examples

1. **Example (248a)**
   - **Sentence:** vhJDFhrhc v`g@j
   - **Gloss:** not–going.to=INDIC.1pl go.PERF
   - **Translation:** ‘We are not going to go.’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""vhj"" which is prefixed to the verb ""going.to"". This indicates that negation is achieved through a bound morpheme (affix).

2. **Example (248b)**
   - **Sentence:** vHx`c v@
   - **Gloss:** never–INDIC.1pl say.PERF DEM
   - **Translation:** ‘We don’t say that.’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""vHx`"" which is prefixed to the verb ""say"". This again shows negation through a bound morpheme.

3. **Example (248c)**
   - **Sentence:** xtatKrHbtW g`JihKhx`
   - **Gloss:** not.able=INDIC.1sg/2sg borrow–give.PERF
   - **Translation:** ‘I can’t loan you (money).’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""xtatK"" which is prefixed to the verb ""borrow–give"". This is another instance of a bound morpheme marking negation.

4. **Example (248d)**
   - **Sentence:** vhJ`QpTr vdFhC F`sGH
   - **Gloss:** not=TEMP=COND=1sg sleep night
   - **Translation:** ‘I did not sleep nights.’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""vhj"" which is prefixed to the verb ""sleep"". This shows negation through a bound morpheme.

5. **Example (248e)**
   - **Sentence:** vHX`l` gTx@K
   - **Gloss:** never=INDIC dance
   - **Translation:** ‘He never danced.’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""vHX`"" which is prefixed to the verb ""dance"". This indicates negation through a bound morpheme.

6. **Example (248f)**
   - **Sentence:** vhL@pQdFhb QtKÊ#`ChQ
   - **Gloss:** unable=INDIC=2sg good–INCEP
   - **Translation:** ‘You cannot become pretty.’
   - **Analysis:** The negation is marked by ""vhL@pQ"" which is prefixed to the verb ""become"". This is another instance of a bound morpheme marking negation.

### Reasoning
From the examples provided, it is evident that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth is consistently marked by morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb. These morphemes appear as prefixes to the verb, indicating that negation is achieved through affixation.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Pattern A**: This pattern involves a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause. Examples provided are:
   - (157) lat ?in-s-?itn (NEG 1sPS-NM-eat) 'I didn’t eat.'
   - (158) lit ?in-s-naw’1x (NEG 2sPS-NM-run(sg.)) 'You didn’t run.'
   - (159) lat slémms (NEG NM-steal-m-3Ps) 'He doesn’t steal anymore.'

2. **Pattern C**: This pattern involves the negation particle lut followed by an unmarked indicative clause.

From the examples and descriptions provided, it is clear that the negation in Columbia-Wenatchi is marked by a particle (lat or lut). The negation particle is not described as being phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, it precedes the nominalized or indicative clause, functioning as a separate word.

Given the information, there is no indication that the negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or any modification of the verb itself. The negation particle appears to be a separate word, not phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negation is marked by a particle (lat or lut) that precedes the clause.
- The particle is not described as an affix or clitic, nor is it indicated to be phonologically bound to the verb.
- The examples show the particle as a separate word, not modifying the verb directly.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Hidatsa,"1. The paragraphs provided clearly indicate that standard negation in Hidatsa is marked by a negative suffix ""-dhaa"" that attaches to the predicate head (the verb). This is evident from the examples given in sentences (266) to (270), where the suffix ""-dhaa"" is consistently used to negate the verb:

- (266) macéé-dhaa-c (man-NEG-DECL) ""He is not a man.""
- (267) úˀsia-dhaa-c (arrive-NEG-DECL) ""He hasn’t arrived.""
- (268) hiirahbí-dhaa (difficult-NEG) ""I didn’t think it would be hard.""
- (269) mi-hiráwi-dhaa-gsá-wa (1C-sleep-NEG-USI-SIMULT) ""I often go to bed late; therefore I am used to it.""
- (270) mii-írigi-dhaa-rúg (1B-hit-NEG-COND) ""Let the evil go around us so that it won’t hit us.""

The consistent use of the suffix ""-dhaa"" attached directly to the verb indicates that negation in Hidatsa is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Toqabaqita,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Toqabaqita, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negative Subject Markers**: The paragraph mentions that one of the strategies for negation involves negative subject markers that occur inside the verb phrase. This suggests that these markers are closely associated with the verb, potentially as affixes or clitics.

2. **Negative Verb**: Another strategy involves a lexical negative verb. While this verb itself may not be an affix or clitic, its presence as a separate word does not necessarily preclude the possibility of other bound morphemes being used in negation.

3. **Double Negative Construction**: This involves a negative event clause with a preceding ""mini-clause"" containing the negative verb. This construction indicates a more complex negation strategy but does not provide specific information about bound morphemes.

The example (17-1) provided:
```
Keeroqa kesi fula.
3DU.NEG arrive 3DU
‘The two of them did not arrive.’
```
Here, ""kesi"" is glossed as ""3DU.NEG,"" indicating that the negation is marked on the subject marker itself, which is part of the verb phrase. This suggests that the negation is indeed marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Toqabaqita can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Aghu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The examples given in this paragraph do not explicitly show a negation marker that is phonologically bound to the verb. The imperative forms ""not.want.IMP[SG]"" and ""not.want.IMP-PL"" are used, but these do not provide clear evidence of a bound negation marker on the verb itself.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (134) shows the use of ""baxe-n=de"" where ""de"" is the negation marker. The negation marker ""de"" appears to be a clitic, as indicated by the equals sign (=), and it attaches to the verbal noun form ""baxe-n"".
   - Example (135) shows ""da-de=dè"" where again ""de"" is the negation marker, attaching to the finite realis form ""da-de"". The use of the equals sign (=) indicates that ""de"" is a clitic that attaches to the verb form.

From these examples, it is evident that the negation marker ""de"" can attach to the verb forms as a clitic, which is phonologically bound to the verb. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation marker ""de"" is shown to attach to the verb forms as a clitic, which is phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by the equals sign (=) in the glosses.
- This attachment of the negation marker to the verb forms meets the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Manambu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Manambu, we can determine the method of standard negation. Here are the key points relevant to negation:

1. **Automatic Alternations in Verbs**:
   - The deletion of a final vowel in forming a negative non-future form of a disyllabic root has a similar effect, e.g., ""laku-"" (know), ""ma: la:kw"" (did not/do not know).

2. **Root-Specific Alternations in Verbs**:
   - Negative declarative non-future forms of monosyllabic verbs involve reduction of the root vowel, e.g., ""da-"" (go down), ""ma: d@"" (did not/do not go down).
   - Disyllabic verbs of CVCV structure and verbs of CVC structure have vowel alternations in the negative non-future form, e.g., ""waku-"" (go out), ""ma: wa:kw"" (did not/do not go out).
   - The first syllable vowel undergoes compensatory lengthening in the negative form, e.g., ""waj@-"" (laugh), ""ma: wa:j"" (did not/do not laugh).

From these points, it is clear that the negation in Manambu involves modifications of the verb itself, specifically through vowel alternations and vowel deletions in the verb root when forming negative non-future forms. These modifications are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The examples provided show that negation in Manambu is achieved by modifying the verb root (e.g., vowel deletion and vowel alternation).
- These modifications are inherent to the verb and form a phonological unit with it, fulfilling the criteria for being considered as marking negation directly on the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Momu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Momu, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation via Particle ""momu""**:
   - The particle ""momu"" is used to negate verbal predicates. This is evident in examples (12.43a) and (12.43b):
     - (12.43a) ""Ie eru netyi=momu."" (fish that throw.one[1|3sgS]=neg) - 'He did not throw the fish.'
     - (12.43b) ""Bikos kwu eru, ai-kuw=momu esy=e."" (because food that impf-consume\3sgS=neg sago.jelly=emph) - 'Because he does/did not eat that food, the sago jelly.'
   - In both examples, ""momu"" is attached to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. The use of ""="" in the gloss indicates that ""momu"" functions as a clitic bound to the verb.

2. **Negating Predicate ""onfa""**:
   - Another method of negation mentioned is the use of the negating predicate ""onfa"" (§12.2.2). However, specific examples of ""onfa"" in use are not provided in the given paragraphs, so we cannot analyze its exact behavior from this text alone.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence from the examples, it is clear that the particle ""momu"" attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This qualifies as a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking in the language Momu.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Makasae,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negation Marker Analysis**:
   - The negator **nomo** is described as the only VP-internal negator. This indicates that **nomo** is used within the verb phrase to negate the verb.
   - The examples provided show **nomo** positioned within the VP, but there is no indication that it is phonologically bound to the verb. It appears to function as a separate word (particle) within the VP.
   - The negator **nomohaka** is used to negate whole clauses and is not relevant for standard negation of dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Position and Scope**:
   - The VP templates (191) and (192) show the position of **nomo** within the VP, surrounded by adverbials and other elements. This further supports that **nomo** is a particle within the VP rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.
   - The examples (189) and (193) illustrate **nomo** used in sentences, but again, it is not attached to the verb. It is a separate word that follows the verb or other elements within the VP.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that **nomo** or any other negation marker in Makasae is an affix, clitic, or involves modification of the verb itself. **Nomo** functions as a separate particle within the VP.

Given this analysis, it is clear that standard negation in Makasae is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the appropriate option is:

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Motuna,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Motuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. The paragraph explicitly mentions the ""negative infix"" in the context of verbal morphology. This indicates that negation can be marked by an infix, which is a type of affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. The structure of S0 verbs includes a slot for ""negative"" before TAM (Tense-Aspect-Mood) and other suffixes, suggesting that the negation marker is integrated into the verb's morphological structure.

Given this information, it is clear that negation in Motuna involves a morphological process that is bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Lavukaleve,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not possible to determine the method of standard negation in Lavukaleve. The text does not provide any explicit examples or descriptions of negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. The examples given primarily focus on narrative sequences and do not include any negative constructions or markers that could be analyzed for their phonological binding to the verb.

To determine the method of standard negation, we would need specific information on how negation is marked in Lavukaleve, such as whether there are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb that indicate negation. Since this information is not present in the given paragraph, we cannot conclude how negation is marked in this language.

**Reasoning:**
1. The paragraph does not contain any negative constructions or markers.
2. There is no information on how negation is expressed in declarative sentences with dynamic verbal predicates.
3. Without examples or descriptions of negation, it is impossible to determine if negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",1,0
Dla (Menggwa),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dla (Menggwa), we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the relevant examples:

1. **Negative realis:**
   - Example 3-17: ""yarifi bokefyehi"" (stir.sago NEG:R-N1FDU-PRES:CONT) – ‘They two are not stirring sago.’
   - Example 3-18: ""nefi boka-hi-Ø-hwa"" (shoot NEG:R-1SG-3MSG:O-PAST) – ‘I did not shoot him.’

2. **Negative semi-realis:**
   - Example 3-21: ""ga yari-nya-a"" (NEG:SMR stir.sago-N1DU-3FSG:O) – ‘They two will not stir sago.’
   - Example 3-22: ""ga na-hi-Ø"" (NEG:SMR shoot-1SG-3MSG:O) – ‘I will not shoot him.’

3. **Negative irrealis:**
   - Example 3-25: ""yari-ma-nya-a-naho"" (stir.sago-NEG:IR-N1DU-3FSG:O-CNTF) – ‘They would not have stirred sago.’

From these examples, we observe the following:

- In the **negative realis** construction, the negation marker appears to be ""boke"" or ""boka,"" which is placed before the verb and seems to be a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.
- In the **negative semi-realis** construction, the negation marker ""ga"" is also placed before the verb and appears to be a separate word.
- In the **negative irrealis** construction, the negation marker ""ma"" is attached to the verb as a prefix (e.g., ""yari-ma-nya-a-naho"").

Given that the negative irrealis construction uses a prefix ""ma-"" attached to the verb, this indicates that at least one method of standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) involves a bound morpheme (an affix) attached to the verb.

### Reasoning:
The presence of the prefix ""ma-"" in the negative irrealis construction (example 3-25) demonstrates that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. This satisfies the criteria for coding the language as 1 for this feature.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Duna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by a circumfix on the verb. The negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to express negation on verbal predicates. This circumfix is added to the verb base and forms a phonological unit with the verb, which qualifies it as a bound morpheme.

### Reasoning:
1. **Negative Circumfix**: The paragraphs describe a negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" that attaches to the verb. This circumfix is used to negate verbal predicates, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.
2. **Examples**: The examples provided (e.g., ""rindi-ta na-ra-ya"" and ""no na-ke-ya-o"") show the circumfix attached to the verb, forming a single phonological unit.
3. **Combination with TAM Markers**: The circumfix can also occur in combination with TAM inflections, further indicating that it is an integral part of the verb's morphological structure.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Duna can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Taulil,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language Taulil. The paragraph discusses syntactic functions of demonstratives and modifying elements such as PPs and adverbs, but it does not provide any information about how negation is marked in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

1. The paragraph does not mention any negation markers, whether they are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. It focuses on demonstratives and their syntactic functions, which are unrelated to the topic of standard negation.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation of Transitive Verbs**:
   - The verb stem changes to its irrealis form when negated.
   - The negation is marked by the negator ""wákare,"" which appears clause-finally.
   - Example: ""akru wákare"" (consume.irr-3sg.f.irr.o neg) for ""he didn’t eat pork.""

2. **Negation of Intransitive Verbs**:
   - Similar to transitive verbs, intransitive verbs also reveal their root forms when negated.
   - The negation involves the irrealis suffix (-ki, -kɨ, or -ku) attached to the verb stem.
   - Example: ""okɨ wákare"" (go.irr-irr neg) for ""I didn’t go.""

From these points, it is clear that the irrealis suffixes (-ki, -kɨ, -ku) are attached to the verb stems in negation, indicating that negation in Taiap involves a modification of the verb through suffixation. Additionally, the negator ""wákare"" is a separate particle that appears clause-finally.

### Conclusion:
1

The reasoning is based on the observation that the irrealis suffixes (-ki, -kɨ, -ku) are phonologically bound to the verb stems, marking the verbs as irrealis in negation. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation involving affixation or modification of the verb.",0,1
Yimas,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation Prefix**:
   - The text explicitly mentions that Yimas uses a negative prefix ""ta-"" to mark negation. This prefix is attached directly to the verb, as seen in the examples:
     - Positive: `ama-wa-t` (1SG S-go-PERF) 'I went.'
     - Negative: `ta-ka-wa-t` (NEG-1SG S-go-PERF) 'I didn't go.'
   - Another example:
     - Positive: `kapa-wa-t` (1DL S-go-PERF) 'We two went.'
     - Negative: `ta-ŋkra-wa-r-(r)m` (NEG-1DL S-go-PERF-DL) 'We two didn't go.'

2. **Phonological Binding**:
   - The negative prefix ""ta-"" is phonologically bound to the verb, forming a single phonological unit with it. This is evident from the structure of the examples provided, where the prefix directly precedes the verb root.

3. **Re-arrangement of Verbal Morphology**:
   - The text mentions that the introduction of the negative prefix ""ta-"" can cause re-arrangements in the verbal morphology, indicating that the prefix is an integral part of the verb's morphological structure.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence that the negative prefix ""ta-"" is phonologically bound to the verb and directly modifies the verb to indicate negation, it is clear that standard negation in Yimas can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, in Paragraph 2 (A.1.11), the sentence ""yow sowoi"" is glossed as ""NEG SG>3.HOD.PFV\see.RS,"" where ""yow"" is the negation marker. This negation marker ""yow"" appears to be phonologically bound to the verb, as it directly precedes the verb form ""s\owo/y"" (see). Similarly, in Paragraph 3 (A.2.13), the sentence ""epi yow srboru pompa"" is glossed as ""TOP=DIST.PROX NEG SG>3.RMT.PFV\pick.RS DIST.ABL,"" where ""yow"" again functions as a negation marker bound to the verb ""s\rbor/w"" (pick).

These examples demonstrate that the negation marker ""yow"" is used in conjunction with the verb and forms a phonological unit with it, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by a clitic or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Maybrat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, it is clear that standard negation is primarily marked by the clausal negator ""fe"" and its predicative counterpart ""m-fe."" These negators are used in various syntactic environments to negate clauses and nominal phrases. However, there is no indication that these negators are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself. Instead, they appear to function as separate words or particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

For example, in sentences like ""om m-ais fe"" (It is not raining) and ""ana m-asah fe"" (They do not laugh), the negator ""fe"" follows the verb but is not attached to it as an affix or clitic. Similarly, the predicative form ""m-fe"" functions as a separate verb meaning ""it is not"" and is not bound to the main verb of the clause.

Given this information, it is not possible to determine that standard negation in Maybrat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negators ""fe"" and ""m-fe"" do not meet the criteria of being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation Markers**: The text mentions several negation markers such as ""opdk/pak,"" ""opow/pow,"" and ""emdr."" These markers are used to express negation in various contexts.

2. **Phonological Binding**: The negation markers ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" are described as being linked to specific forms of the verb, such as the ""m-/mV-"" forms. For example:
   - ""m@or pdk embf"" (see not /did) translates to ""I did not see it.""
   - ""Sujit masetdj powd"" (Sajit has not arrived) translates to ""Sajit arrived not.""

3. **Affixation or Cliticization**: The negation markers appear to be phonologically bound to the verb forms they negate. This is evident from the examples where the negation markers directly follow the verb forms, indicating a close phonological relationship.

4. **Examples of Bound Negation**:
   - ""opdk fiak"" (not not) translates to ""really! positively!""
   - ""Sujit masetdj powd"" (Sajit has not arrived) translates to ""Sajit arrived not.""

Given these observations, it is clear that standard negation in Asmat can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as affixes or clitics.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation markers ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" are described as being linked to specific verb forms, indicating that they form a phonological unit with the verb.
- The examples provided show that these negation markers follow the verb forms closely, suggesting affixation or cliticization.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Kuot,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, the following observations can be made regarding the standard negation in the language:

1. **Negation with ""tǝle"" and ""tǝla""**:
   - The negator ""tǝle"" is used to negate any type of predicate and occurs before the negated constituent. It is not phonologically bound to the verb but rather appears as a separate word.
   - Example (17): ""Tǝle=kan [u-me ubi]"" (NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø) translates to ""He didn’t use to work.""
   - The variant ""tǝla"" is used in future contexts but similarly is not bound to the verb.

2. **Negation with ""mani""**:
   - The negator ""mani"" is used particularly in the northern Kuot-speaking area and is also not phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Example (19): ""mani u-la=kan u-onǝma"" (what 3mS-go=EMPH 3mS-sit) translates to ""he didn’t go and sit down.""

3. **Negative Existential ""karuk""**:
   - The negative existential ""karuk"" means ""is not"" or ""there isn’t"" and is used as a separate word.
   - Example (20): ""Karuk=kan ma lop tiro"" (is.not=EMPH 3p.PossI child.nsg here) translates to ""There are no children here.""

4. **Prohibitive ""buat""**:
   - The prohibitive particle ""buat"" is used to express negative imperative and is also a separate word.
   - Example (21): ""Buat ma-mi-lo!"" (PROHIB 3pO-2pS-tell) translates to ""Don’t tell them!""

From the given paragraphs, it is clear that the negation markers in Kuot (tǝle, tǝla, mani, karuk, buat) are all separate words and not phonologically bound to the verb. There is no indication of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation markers are described as separate particles that precede the verb or the negated constituent.
- There is no evidence of these markers being affixes or clitics that attach directly to the verb.
- The examples provided show the negation markers as separate words, not bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Imonda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix ""-rn"" (realized as ""-me"" in conjunction with ""sg"") is used to mark negation on the verb. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in examples (5) and (6):

(5) ehe sg eg -1 -uagl-f -me
3 NEG follow-OB/NS-3O -PRS-NEG
'he does not follow them'

(6) Mui t sg puhG -i -me
NAM NEG come up-PST-NEG
'Muit did not turn up'

Additionally, the suffix ""-m"" is used in other negation strategies, as shown in examples (7) and (10):

(7) at 6h-nki-m ka 6 -f -m
NEG PX-SRC-GL 1 say-PRS-NEG
'I am not talking of this one'

(10) toad- i an6 i bal -m
boys-NPL DUM-NEG
'I am not a boy'

These examples demonstrate that negation in Imonda can indeed be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nimboran,,0,
Abun,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, standard negation in the language is marked by particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb. The primary negative particle ""nde"" and the secondary particle ""yo"" are used to bracket the predicate, but they do not attach to the verb as affixes or clitics. Instead, they are separate words that occur in specific syntactic positions relative to the predicate. The grammar explicitly states that Abun has very little affixation and does not use affixes to negate words. Additionally, the inherently negative verbs mentioned do not involve affixation or cliticization for negation but are inherently negative in meaning.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Meryam Mir,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, the following observations can be made regarding standard negation:

1. **Negation Particle**: The negation in Meryam Mir is marked by the particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" which precedes the verb. This particle is described as being in free variation and must occur before the verb to negate an event.

2. **Position of Negation Particle**: The negation particle typically follows the first accented element in the utterance and precedes the verb, as seen in examples (5.77), (5.78), and (5.79).

3. **Clause Initial Position**: The negation particle can also appear at the beginning of a clause that is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause, as shown in example (5.80).

From the given information, it is clear that the negation in Meryam Mir is marked by a particle that precedes the verb. There is no indication that this particle is an affix, clitic, or involves any modification of the verb itself. The particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" appears to be a separate word that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" is described as a particle and not as an affix or clitic.
- The particle precedes the verb but does not attach to it or modify it in any way.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that the negation particle forms a phonological unit with the verb.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Hatam,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hatam, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negation Markers**: The paragraphs indicate that Hatam uses two negative adverbs: ""big"" for negation of declaratives and interrogatives, and ""au"" for imperatives. Both of these negative adverbs are described as being in clause-final position.

2. **Examples**:
   - (4.90) ""hab hi Ieni ji-ttei big"" (You didn't bring a bird, did you?)
   - (4.91) ""Ii-teu tibor au"" (Don't grab your (bow and) arrows.)
   - (4.92) ""Njap gom dem mem ni-pilei hab can kan big"" (One day was not at all enough for us to shoot two birds.)
   - (4.93) ""Yoni i-kwei ei Mar big-yo"" (They have not yet come to Warmare.)
   - (4.94) ""binmai Nab pi-ma big tu"" (That pig no longer moved.)

3. **Analysis**:
   - The negative markers ""big"" and ""au"" are described as adverbs and are placed at the end of the clause.
   - There is no indication that these negative markers are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. They appear to function as separate words (particles) that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

Given the information provided, it is clear that the standard negation in Hatam is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by separate negative adverbs that are placed at the end of the clause.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Kwomtari,"Based on the provided paragraph from the Kwomtari grammar, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Kwomtari can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The table lists various verbal affixes, including a suffix labeled ""NEG"" under the ""Verb final suffixes"" category. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix that attaches to the verb.

### Reasoning:
1. The table explicitly includes a ""NEG"" suffix under the ""Verb final suffixes"" category, which suggests that negation is marked by an affix that attaches to the verb.
2. Since the ""NEG"" suffix is listed among other verbal affixes, it is reasonable to conclude that it forms a phonological unit with the verb.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Inanwatan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, it is evident that standard negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb. Specifically, the suffix ""-aigo"" is used to mark negation on the verb, as seen in the examples provided:

- (3.60) ""(Nawo) ne-se-s-aigo."" (not I SG.s-walk-FUT-NEG) 'I am not going to walk.'
- (3.61) ""neqo-y-aigo"" (catch-TR-NEG) 'They did not catch him.'

These examples clearly show that the negative suffix ""-aigo"" is phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through an affix.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iau,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Markers**: The paragraphs describe two main particles used for negation in Iau: 'ae' and 'ai'. These particles are used to mark negation and follow the verb or the verb and a clitic stative particle if present.

2. **Position and Phonological Binding**: The negation particles 'ae' and 'ai' immediately follow the verb, as seen in the examples:
   - ""Y⁸ bui² i⁷ ai⁹ y⁴."" (We didn't /never did go upstream.)
   - ""A⁹ to⁶ i⁷ ae⁵."" (I did not go at all.)
   - ""Ui⁷⁻⁸-de⁸ ae⁵."" (He is not standing.)

3. **Affixation and Cliticization**: The negation particles are not described as affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they are described as particles that follow the verb. There is no indication that these particles attach to the verb as affixes or clitics.

4. **Examples of Negation**: The examples provided consistently show the negation particles as separate entities following the verb, without any indication of phonological binding:
   - ""Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸ ae⁹ ba³?"" (You do not eat corn do you?)
   - ""Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷ ae³ se⁹ dy⁴ a³ y³."" (Since Benjamin hasn't ever seen a plane, he acted like that.)
   - ""Ty⁷ bi⁷si⁹ di⁹ di⁸ ai⁷ di⁸ y⁹ by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ di⁹ o⁷ di⁷ y³."" (If you had not killed that person, then you could have taken me (as wife).)

Given the information provided, it is clear that the negation in Iau is marked by particles that follow the verb but are not phonologically bound to it as affixes or clitics. Therefore, standard negation in Iau cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Karkar-Yuri can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The paragraph mentions the use of a suffix for negation in the context of a verb:

- The phrase ""suffix =nizo"" and ""suffix -noi-"" indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

This suggests that negation is achieved through a morphological modification of the verb, specifically by adding a suffix, which is a phonologically bound morpheme.

1. The reasoning for the chosen option is that the descriptive grammar explicitly mentions the use of a suffix for negation, which qualifies as an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. This fits the criteria for marking standard negation as outlined in the guidelines.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yelî Dnye,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yelî Dnye, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Negation Marker ""daa""**: The basic form used in negation is ""daa"" which means 'not'. The examples provided show that ""daa"" merges with the verbal prenucleus to form new portmanteau morphemes. This merging indicates that the negation marker is not a free-standing particle but rather forms a phonological unit with the verb.

2. **Portmanteau Morphemes**: The tables and examples illustrate how ""daa"" combines with various TMA (Tense, Mood, Aspect) markers and subject person markers to create complex forms. For instance:
   - ""dipi ndli"" (negative form) vs. ""nJ ndli"" (positive form) for PLREM.1SG.SB.
   - ""d:oo ndli"" (immediate past negative) vs. ""Di mao"" (immediate past positive).

3. **Examples of Negated Verbs**: The examples provided show the negation marker integrated into the verb forms:
   - ""D:oo ndli"" (I didn’t eat it today).
   - ""D:oo ma too"" (I didn’t eat them today).
   - ""Nange vy:a"" (Don’t hit it/him).

These examples demonstrate that the negation marker ""daa"" is phonologically bound to the verb, either through merging or forming portmanteau morphemes.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Sentani,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is clear that standard negation in Sentani can be marked by a circumfix that attaches directly to the verb root. The paragraph explicitly mentions the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG, which attaches to the verb root to negate the verb itself.

Here is the relevant excerpt from the paragraph:

""The negative, ə- -j NEG, also attaches directly to the verb root, but due to its infrequency it cannot be said whether it is reserved to the first verb root of the verbal complex. The negative circumfix only negates the verb itself, rather than having scope over the entire sentence.""

This indicates that the negation is marked by a circumfix, which is a type of affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The negative circumfix ə- -j NEG is described as attaching directly to the verb root.
2. This circumfix is a bound morpheme, which qualifies as an affix.
3. The description clearly states that this circumfix negates the verb itself, fitting the criteria for standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1.7 Adverb of negation**:
   - The adverb of negation ""jan"" is described as always occurring clause-finally. Examples (201) and (202) show ""jan"" positioned at the end of the clause to indicate negation.
   - In (201): ""De-unot Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem jan."" translates to ""They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem. They know that Seppy does not live in Saukorem.""
   - In (202): ""De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem."" translates to ""They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""jan"" functions as a separate word (particle) that is not phonologically bound to the verb. It does not attach to the verb as an affix or clitic, nor does it modify the verb directly.

2. **Paragraph 1.8 To be or be not: the presentative mu**:
   - This paragraph discusses the presentative ""mu"" used with verbs like ""ut"" (to stay), ""i"" (to stand), ""jap"" (to sit), or ""kon"" (to lie, sleep). However, it does not provide information on negation.

Given the information from these paragraphs, the negation in Mpur is marked by the separate particle ""jan"" that occurs clause-finally. There is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Reasoning**:
- The adverb ""jan"" is a separate word and not phonologically bound to the verb.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Mehek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix ""-nak"" is used as a negative marker that attaches directly to the verb stem, as seen in examples such as (324) ""mesu-nak"" (hear-VNEG) and (337) ""rusu-nak"" (stand-VNEG). Additionally, the verb ""na"" (be at) can take the negative suffix ""-nak"" in auxiliary constructions, as illustrated in examples like (341) ""na-nak"" (be.at-VNEG).

These instances demonstrate that negation in Mehek can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Abui,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Reasoning:

1. **Negation with the Verb ""naha""**:
   - The paragraphs describe that Abui uses the verb ""naha"" to mark negation. This verb follows the negated verb phrase (VP) and is glossed as NEG.
   - Examples provided:
     - (210a) ""al loku di fe mahiting nee naha"" (Muslims do not eat pork)
     - (210b) ""na tukoi naha"" (I am not strong)
   - In these examples, ""naha"" is used as a separate word following the main verb, indicating that it is not an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

2. **Prohibitive Particles**:
   - The grammar also mentions prohibitive particles ""he"" and ""doma"" used in imperative constructions. These particles are not bound to the verb but appear as separate words.

3. **Multi-verbal Predicates**:
   - In multi-verbal predicates, ""naha"" is used to negate the entire construction, but it remains a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.

4. **Independent Predicate Use**:
   - ""Naha"" can also function independently as a predicate, combining with arguments, further supporting that it is not bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, standard negation in Abui is marked by the verb ""naha,"" which is used as a separate word following the verb phrase. There is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arapesh (Abu), we can analyze the method of standard negation.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation Markers**:
   - The text mentions two forms used by Abu' speakers to express negation: ""uwa'"" (not) and ""duwa'"" (nothing).
   - Example sentences provided:
     - **Sentence 25**: 
       ```
       -u -k -a -ha -' 3SGEA -IR-NONPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU 'She did not hit her.’
       uwa' not
       ```
       This sentence shows the negation marker ""uwa'"" used to negate the verb phrase.
     - **Sentence 26**:
       ```
       alemam mm -a -fan duwa' men 3PLMA-R-sit nothing 'The men sat doing nothing.’
       ```
       This sentence shows the negation marker ""duwa'"" used to express ""doing nothing.""

2. **Phonological Binding**:
   - The negation markers ""uwa'"" and ""duwa'"" are presented as separate words following the verb phrases.
   - There is no indication that these negation markers are affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. They appear to function as separate particles.

3. **Conclusion Based on Guidelines**:
   - The negation markers ""uwa'"" and ""duwa'"" do not form a phonological unit with the verb root. They are separate particles that follow the verb phrase.
   - There is no evidence from the provided text that negation in Arapesh (Abu) is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Conclusion:
0

The reasoning is that the negation markers in Arapesh (Abu) are separate particles and not phonologically bound to the verb, based on the provided paragraphs.",0,0
Korafe,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

1. **Negation Structure**:
   - The negation of predications in Korafe involves the negative focus marker **jo** 'not' and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative deverbal **-ae** 'not doing' at its terminus.
   - The copula **ri** follows the negative deverbal, indicating an event that has occurred prior to the speech-act moment.
   - For specific time frames, the negative deverbal precedes an appropriately inflected form of the verb **e** 'do'.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Na jo ning-ae=ri.**
     - **I S NEG hear.I-not.do=COP.AQ**
     - 'I didn't hear (what was said).'
   - **Na jo ning-ae+e-teni.**
     - **I S NEG hear.I-not.do+dO.l-TP. I S.AQ**
     - 'I didn't hear (what was said just now).'
   - **Na jo ning-ae+er-ena.**
     - **I S NEG hear. I-not.do+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN**
     - 'I do not hear (what is being said).'
   - **Na jo ning-ae+arena.**
     - **I S NEG hear.I-not.do+do.F.I S.FN**
     - 'I will not listen. I don't want to listen (to what I believe will be said).'

3. **Analysis**:
   - The negative marker **-ae** is clearly an affix that attaches to the verb stem, indicating negation.
   - The examples show that **-ae** is phonologically bound to the verb, forming a single phonological unit with the verb stem.
   - The presence of the copula **ri** and the verb **e** in different tenses further supports that the negative marker **-ae** is an integral part of the verb complex.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Korafe can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph discusses the polarity parameter, noting that affirmative is unmarked while negative is marked differently depending on the clause's transitivity and the verb's mode.
   - It mentions that negative clauses include specific exponents of the predicates and additional function slots not present in affirmative clauses.
   - The negative function slot can permute to any pre-predicate position, and when both rhetorical and negative slots are present, the negative slot must follow the rhetorical predicate and immediately precede the predicate.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The examples provided in this paragraph illustrate various types of negative clauses.
   - Example 18a shows a negative copulative clause: ""yimar nhaibroer man"" ('The man is not big'), where ""nhaibroer"" seems to be a negative marker.
   - Example 19a-d provides examples of negative finite declarative clauses:
     - ""NEG finji Kaunsel-r teh-w-me-a-r"" ('He was not being the counsellor.')
     - ""NEG tafite rer noh-r-fe-r"" ('He has not yet died.')
     - ""NEG yimar nuam finjiyak-kah"" ('A man is not getting food.')
     - ""NEG afehir hwat-r-m nuam"" ('He will not give them food.')
   - Example 20a-b shows negative hortative clauses with rhetorical predicates:
     - ""Rhet. Pred. mi-rah-r Kaunsel a-teh"" ('He will say (but should not) ""I should be counsellor"" = 'He should not be the counsellor.')
     - ""Rhet. Pred. yenr mi-rah-r a-i-a"" ('The boy will say (but should not) ""I should go."" = 'The boy should not go.')

### Reasoning:

- The examples provided in paragraph 2 clearly show that the negative marker (e.g., ""NEG"", ""nhaibroer"", ""tafite"") is directly associated with the verb forms in the sentences.
- The negative markers appear to be phonologically bound to the verb, either as prefixes or as part of the verb complex.
- The presence of negative markers directly modifying the verb or being part of the verb complex indicates that standard negation in Alamblak can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:

1. Based on the evidence provided in the examples, it is clear that standard negation in Alamblak can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Marker**: The negative particle ""mi"" is used to express negation in I'saka. It appears clause-finally in sentences with verbal, adjectival, and nominal predicates.
   
2. **Position of the Negation Marker**: The examples provided show that ""mi"" is placed at the end of the clause, following the verb or predicate. For instance:
   - ""k-ei Pi mi."" (It won't rain.)
   - ""Wasa dina taka mi."" (My basket isn't heavy.)
   - ""A dina mi."" (That's not my pig.)

3. **Clause-Final Particle**: The text explicitly states that ""mi"" is a clause-final particle and not a verb-final particle. This is further supported by the fact that postverbal elements can appear between the verb and the negator ""mi"".

Given this information, the negation marker ""mi"" is a separate word (particle) that is not phonologically bound to the verb. It does not function as an affix or clitic attached to the verb, nor does it involve any modification of the verb itself.

Therefore, based on the guidelines and the provided paragraph, standard negation in I'saka cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Urim,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, it is clear that standard negation in Urim is marked by the particle ""ake"" for verbal clauses. The examples provided show that ""ake"" is used as a separate word and not as an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. For instance:

- ""Ake kil atning"" (NEG 3sg listen.R) – 'He did not listen' (emphatic)
- ""Tu ake kai anong"" (3pl NEG go village) – 'They did not go to the village/home'

The negator ""ake"" appears before or after the subject but is not attached to the verb itself. Additionally, the negator ""kalpis"" is used for non-verbal clauses and also appears as a separate word, not bound to the verb.

Since the negators ""ake"" and ""kalpis"" are not affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb, and no other bound negation markers are described in the provided text, it is clear that standard negation in Urim is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Abau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, it is clear that standard negation in the language is marked by the clause-final markers ""pey"" for imperfective aspect and ""pa"" for perfective aspect. These markers are not described as affixes or clitics that attach to the verb or modify the verb itself. Instead, they occur at the end of the clause, indicating that they function as separate words (particles) rather than being phonologically bound to the verb. 

For example:
- (18) ""Hakwe hye nonkway lwak pey."" ('I do not know him.')
- (22) ""Enekwei sehiy non hakwe hano sa ke nonkway lwak pa."" ('At that time I did not know my wife.')

Since these negation markers are not bound to the verb but are instead clause-final particles, they do not meet the criteria for being considered affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Chamorro,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

1. **Sentential Negative ""ti""**:
   - The default method for forming negative sentences in Chamorro is by using the sentential negative ""ti,"" which occurs at the beginning of the clause, to the left of the tense-aspect-mood marker and the predicate. This is illustrated in examples (1a) and (1b):
     - (1a) ""Ti para u hånåo i ma’gas på’gu."" ('The boss is not going to leave today.')
     - (1b) ""Ti amiga i infitmera."" ('The nurse was not a friend.')

2. **Negative Verbs**:
   - Chamorro also has negative verbs whose meanings include sentence negation. These verbs are listed along with their affirmative counterparts:
     - tai ‘not have’ (vs. gai ‘have’)
     - taigui ‘not be (at a location)’ (vs. gaigi ‘be (at a location)’)
     - tåya’ ‘not exist’ (vs. guaha ‘exist’)
     - cha’- ‘better not, don’t’
     - mungnga ‘don’t, let it not be’
   - Examples of sentences formed with negative verbs include:
     - (4a) ""I patgun siempri ha’ tumataigui gi fi’un i saina-ña."" ('The child certainly will not be right beside his parent.')
     - (4b) ""Tai sanhalum i niyuk ni båobåo."" ('The coconut that sounds hollow inside does not have anything inside.')
     - (4c) ""Kalakas, cha’-mu chuchuda’ i kuchinu na hånum."" ('Yuck! Don’t spill the dirty water.')

3. **Negative Indefinites**:
   - Negative sentences can also be formed from a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. These are formed by combining the word-level negative ""ni"" with an indefinite noun phrase or a prepositional phrase whose object is an indefinite noun phrase. Examples include:
     - (5a) ""Ni unu u maguf ni esti i che’chu’ båba."" ('No one will be happy with unsatisfactory work.')
     - (5b) ""Un kebrånta håo muna’lagu låo ni håfa tiningo’-mu."" ('You came forward about cooking, but you know nothing (about it).')

Given this information, we can determine that Chamorro employs both sentential negatives and negative verbs to mark standard negation. The negative verbs, in particular, are modifications of the verb itself, which fits the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of negative verbs such as ""tai,"" ""taigui,"" ""tåya’,"" ""cha’-,"" and ""mungnga"" indicates that standard negation can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb.
- These negative verbs are inherently negative and serve as the main predicate of the sentence, thus fulfilling the requirement of being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Awtuw,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, paragraph 4.2.3 mentions the use of morphological negation with the prefixes ""ka-"" or ""kffi-"" to negate clauses with verbal predicates. Examples (28) and (29) illustrate this:

- (28) Awt i y kffi-W- ffiy- re
  Awtiy NG-NF-go-FU
  'Awtiy isn't going'

- (29) Awt i y - re wan k a - d - uwpo - ka
  Awtiy-o lSG NG-FA-see- PF
  'I haven't seen Awtiy'

These examples demonstrate that the negation is achieved through the use of a prefix attached to the verb, indicating that the negation marker forms a phonological unit with the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mian,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Medial Verb Clitics**: The grammar describes medial verb markers such as =a and =ta, which cliticize to medial verbs in clause chains. This indicates that clitics can attach to verbs in Mian.

2. **Negative Clitic =ba**: The grammar explicitly states that the clitic =ba is used to express negation in clauses containing a finite verb. It follows the subject suffix or the tense suffix in the post-subject slot. This clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, as it attaches directly to the verb complex.

Examples provided in the grammar:
- (198) ""un-aamab-i=ba=be"" (go.PFV-IRR.NANPL-1SG.SBJ=DECL) translates to ""I will not carry the string bags.""
- (199) ""un-Ø-i-bio=ba=be"" (go.PFV-IRR.NANPL-1SG.SBJ=DECL) translates to ""I didn’t carry the string bags.""

In both examples, the clitic =ba is attached to the verb complex, indicating that negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative clitic =ba attaches directly to the verb complex, following the subject or tense suffixes.
- This attachment qualifies as a phonologically bound clitic, which is a valid method of marking standard negation according to the guidelines.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Chácobo,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the methods of negation in Chácobo. Here are the key points:

1. The marker of verbal and clausal negation is =yáma ‘negation’ in all other construction types.
2. The morpheme -ma expresses negation or antonymity when it combines with adjectives and certain nominalized verbs.
3. The (im)possibilative morpheme mɨtsa(ma) is used in a specific auxiliary verb construction.

From this information, we can infer the following:

- The morpheme =yáma is described as a clitic (indicated by the equals sign in the gloss), which suggests it is phonologically bound to the verb or another constituent.
- The morpheme -ma is described as an affix (indicated by the dash in the gloss) that combines with adjectives and certain nominalized verbs, indicating it is phonologically bound to these elements.
- The (im)possibilative morpheme mɨtsa(ma) is used in a specific auxiliary construction, but it is not explicitly stated whether it is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given that =yáma and -ma are both described as phonologically bound morphemes (clitic and affix, respectively), and they are used in negation, we can conclude that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language.

1. The text explicitly states that the most common or basic form of negation in Hup involves a negative suffix (-nˆ¤h) that is used exclusively with verbal predicates. This suffix is described as a Boundary Suffix that attaches to the verb stem and receives primary stress within the verb word. The examples provided further illustrate this usage:

   - Example (1a): ""manga‡ hˆ¤d-a‡n t´w-nˆ¤h"" (Margarita 3pl-OBJ scold-NEG) translates to ""Margarita didn’t yell at them.""
   - Example (2): ""kayak=ti‡g maca-nˆ¤h pˆ¤d; cana‡ b’ˆ¤yˆ/ macá-áh"" (manioc=stem grow-NEG DIST; pineapple only grow-DECL) translates to ""Manioc doesn’t grow either; only pineapples grow.""
   - Example (4a): ""tuk-nˆ¤h /ám?"" (want-NEG 2sg) translates to ""Don’t you want (it)?""

These examples clearly show that the negative marker -nˆ¤h is a suffix that attaches directly to the verb stem, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb.

2. The text also mentions that while there are other strategies for negation in Hup, such as the use of predicative particles (pãÙ) and identity negator particles (/a‡p), the primary method for negating verbal predicates involves the suffix -nˆ¤h.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kwaza,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwaza, it is clear that standard negation in Kwaza can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-he-"" is mentioned as the principal means of expressing negation. The suffix ""-he-"" is described as occurring in a position within the verb complex, between the verb root and person inflection, which indicates that it is an affix and thus phonologically bound to the verb.

Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-.**
2. **The negative suffix -he- occurs in two different basic types of constructions.**
3. **In the negative construction, the suffix -he- attracts stress, it occurs in a position between the verb root and person inflexion.**

This description clearly indicates that the negation marker ""-he-"" is an affix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The negative suffix ""-he-"" is explicitly described as a verbal suffix.
- It is positioned within the verb complex, specifically between the verb root and person inflection, which confirms its status as an affix.
- The description does not mention any free-standing particles or clitics that are not phonologically bound to the verb for standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Huambisa,"Based on the provided paragraph, it is clear that standard negation in Huambisa (referred to as Wampis in the text) can be marked by affixes on the verb. The paragraph explicitly mentions two negative suffixes, -t͡ʃa and -t͡su, which are used in different morphosyntactic contexts to mark negation on the verb.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The paragraph states that there are two negative suffixes on the verb in Wampis: -t͡ʃa and -t͡su.
   - These suffixes are in complementary distribution, meaning they are used in different contexts to mark negation.
   - Since these suffixes are described as being attached to the verb, they qualify as affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Huambisa can be marked by an affix on the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Cocama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, it is clear that standard negation in Cocama is primarily marked by the use of negative particles, specifically ""tɨma"" and ""ni"". These particles are used to negate various constituents within a clause, including the whole clause, verb phrases, adverbs, and noun phrases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The negative particles ""tɨma"" and ""ni"" are used to mark negation in Cocama. However, these particles are not described as affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they appear as separate words that precede the constituent they negate.
   - For example, in the sentences:
     - ""tɨma ra=tseta eyu-n"" (He doesn’t want food)
     - ""yaepe inu tɨma eyu tewe"" (There, they don’t eat salt)
   - ""tɨma"" is a separate particle that precedes the verb or other constituents to indicate negation.
   - Similarly, ""ni"" is used to negate specific arguments and appears as a separate particle:
     - ""aypuka ni=pura ɨwatsu emete"" (At present, it exists no paiche)
     - ""ni ya=tu ukɨrɨ mayana-ri inu yakɨ-ka=nan"" (This one doesn’t sleep guarding at his head)
   - The descriptions and examples provided do not indicate that these negative particles are phonologically bound to the verb as affixes or clitics. They function as separate words that precede the negated constituent.

Given this information, it is not possible to determine that standard negation in Cocama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tiriyo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiriyo, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Affixation in Negation**:
   - The negative form in Tiriyo involves the use of the suffix ""-ewa"" or ""-sewa"" attached to the verb stem. This is evident in examples such as:
     - ""imoi-jewa"" (obey-Hab-NEG) in (70c)
     - ""t-éne_ta"" (Rm.Pst-see:Rm.Pst-NEG) in (70d)
     - ""ii-rano_rén t-amii-se_ta"" (Rm.Pst-take-Rm.Pst-NEG) in (70e)
     - ""in-akoronma-ewa"" (30-help-NEG) in (71b)
     - ""i-kéhtun-jewa"" (I-scream-NEG) in (71c)
     - ""e-pé-ewa"" (Detr-bathe-NEG) in (71e)
     - ""in-apéé-sewa"" (30-catch-NEG) in (71g)
     - ""in-eta-ewa"" (30-hear-NEG) in (71h)
     - ""ka-ewa"" (say-NEG) in (71j)

2. **Copula and Negation**:
   - The negative form can also involve a copula, but the negation itself is marked on the verb with the suffix ""-ewa"" or ""-sewa"". The copula is used to form a complete negative clause, as seen in:
     - ""in-akoronma-ewa_w-a-e"" (30-help-NEG_1S,-Cop-Cty) in (71b)
     - ""e-pé-ewa_w-a-e"" (Detr-bathe-NEG_1S,-Cop-Cty) in (71e)
     - ""in-apéé-sewa eh-ké"" (30-catch-NEG Cop-Imper) in (71g)
     - ""ka-ewa eh-ké"" (say-NEG Cop-Imper) in (71j)

From these examples, it is clear that standard negation in Tiriyo can be marked by an affix (specifically a suffix) that is phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Ticuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ticuna, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation Marker ""tãů""**:
   - The negation marker ""tãů"" is used as a general marker encoding the negative polarity of a clause without affecting its morphosyntactic structure.
   - Examples (602) to (609) show ""tãů"" being used in various contexts, including verbal and non-verbal predicative phrases, main and subordinate clauses, and different inflectional types (indicative and subjunctive).

2. **Phonological Boundaries**:
   - The examples provided show ""tãů"" as a separate word preceding the verb or other elements in the clause. There is no indication that ""tãů"" is phonologically bound to the verb as an affix or clitic. It appears to function as a particle that is not attached to the verb.

3. **Existential and Topical-Locational Negation**:
   - For existential predication, a different strategy is used. The verb ""tåʼu"" (meaning 'be absent') is employed instead of ""tãů"". This further indicates that ""tãů"" is not modifying the verb directly but is used as a separate negation marker.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, it is clear that the standard negation marker ""tãů"" in Ticuna is not an affix, clitic, or a modification of the verb. It functions as a separate particle. Therefore, based on the guidelines and examples provided, the correct option is:

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraph, it is clear that standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) involves the use of a negative marker that is affixed to the verb. Specifically, the paragraph states that negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. The standard negative marker -ñe is mentioned as being added to the verb structure (slot 10 on the verb structure).

Here is the relevant excerpt from the paragraph:

> ""Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicates is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’).""

This description clearly indicates that the standard negation marker -ñe is an affix that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verbal root.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph explicitly mentions that negation in Murui involves affixation.
2. The standard negative marker -ñe is described as being added to the verb structure.
3. The marker -ñe is an affix that attaches to the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation in Independent Declarative Sentences**:
   - The negative particle **caa** precedes the pronoun subject or follows the topicalized item. This is evident in examples (11) and (22):
     - (11) **Caa** qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani.
     - (22) **Caa** qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani.

2. **Negation in Interrogative and Subordinate Clauses**:
   - A different negative morpheme **-ji** is marked on the verb, and the negative marker **caa** follows the verb. This is shown in examples (12) and (27):
     - (12) Can++ca casira-**ji**-qui-Ø **caa** paapaaja?
     - (27) Ca=t+ quiija (iina) niqui-**ji**-Ø-cura **caa** iina icuani.

3. **Negation in Complex Sentences**:
   - In complex sentences with embedded clauses, the negative morpheme **-ji** is attached to the verb, followed by the negative particle **caa**. This is seen in examples (27) and (29):
     - (27) Ca=t+ quiija (iina) niqui-**ji**-Ø-cura **caa** iina icuani.
     - (29) Iina m+saji caa nu=niqui-qui-Ø (iina) nacusi-**ji**-Ø-Ø **caa** iina icuani umaata.

From the above points, it is clear that the negative morpheme **-ji** is an affix that attaches to the verb in interrogative and subordinate clauses. This affixation is a clear indication that standard negation in Iquito can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Movima,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation Particle ""kas""**:
   - The primary method of negation in Movima involves the particle ""kas"" which precedes the predicate.
   - Example (256): ""kas joro-wa=n"" (NEG sleep-NMZ=2) translates to ""you probably won’t sleep anymore.""
   - Example (257): ""kas u~’us-wa=as"" (NEG DR~move_away-NMZ=n.a) translates to ""He/she did not push the door anymore.""
   - Example (258): ""kas cha’~cha’-wa"" (NEG INV~pierce-NMZ) translates to ""the cows didn’t gore me.""

2. **Action Nominalization**:
   - The predicate in negative clauses is converted into a relational noun by action nominalization.
   - This involves the use of nominalizing suffixes such as ""-wa"" and sometimes reduplication or the suffix ""-e"".
   - Example (259): ""kas dichi<ye:~>ye"" (NEG child<NMZ.N~>) translates to ""she is not a child.""
   - Example (260): ""kas don-’i-e=os chi:~chi"" (NEG blood-D-NMZ=ART.n.p MD~go_out) translates to ""it wasn’t blood anymore what came out.""

3. **Verbalizing and Nominalizing Suffixes**:
   - Free pronouns in clause-initial position are negated by attaching the verbalizing suffix ""-ni"" and subsequently nominalizing it with ""-wa"".
   - Example (261): ""kas rey i’ko-ni-wa"" (NEG again PRO.pl-PRC-NMZ) translates to ""This is not chicha.""
   - Example (262): ""kas rey isko-ni-wa"" (NEG again PRO.pl.a-PRC-NMZ) translates to ""Those didn’t break easily.""

### Conclusion:

The negation in Movima involves the use of the particle ""kas"" and the conversion of the verb into a nominalized form using suffixes such as ""-wa"" and ""-e"". This process indicates that the negation is marked by modifications of the verb through nominalization and suffixation. Therefore, standard negation in Movima can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Bora,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Negation Marker**: The negation in Bora involves the suffixes -thm-ne (-tune) or simply -thm (-tu) attached to the verb. This is evident from the examples provided:
   - (837) ""teha? ti-p’è phé:-thm-nè"" (‘He did not go.’)
   - (838) ""teha? ti-p’è max$ho-thm-(nè)"" (‘He has not eaten.’)
   - (839) ""teha? o a:?iBè-thm"" (‘I did not go home.’)
   - (840) ""teha? ti-p’è max$hó-i-tjhm-(nè)"" (‘He will not eat.’)

2. **Phonological Binding**: The negation suffixes -thm-ne, -thm, -tu, and -tjhm-(nè) are phonologically bound to the verb. This is indicated by the use of the dash in the glosses, which signifies that these are affixes.

3. **High Tone**: Additionally, the verb undergoes a modification with a high tone on its first syllable when negated, which is another form of phonological binding.

4. **Preverbal Particle**: The particle ""teha?"" meaning ""not"" is added to the beginning of the clause. However, the primary negation marking on the verb itself is through the suffixes and tonal modification.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**: The negation markers -thm-ne, -thm, -tu, and -tjhm-(nè) are affixes that attach to the verb, and the verb also undergoes a tonal modification. Both of these methods qualify as phonologically bound negation markers.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Wari',"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', it is evident that standard negation can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negation marker 'om, which means 'to not exist', can be used as a verb or as part of a compound verb to express negation. The examples provided show 'om being used in conjunction with various inflectional morphemes (INFL) such as ca, ta, and xi, which are bound to the verb. Additionally, there are postverbal modifiers like xi', mao, and 'a/'ara that also express negation and are bound to the verb.

For instance:
- In (79b), 'Om ca mao ca. ('He did not go.')
- In (288b), 'Om ca cao' cain carawa. ('He did not eat meat.')
- In (290b), 'Om xi ca-m ('He should not give her an injection.')
- In (296b), Pa' xi' nana carawa. ('They didn’t kill anything.')
- In (298b), Hwara' 'a ca. ('He is not big.')

These examples illustrate that negation in Wari' involves elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as part of a compound verb or as postverbal modifiers.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, we can analyze the method of standard negation as follows:

1. The paragraph mentions the use of the negative suffix ""janiw"" in negative statements.
2. It describes the construction ""janiw...Vti"" where ""V"" indicates a vowel and ""ti"" is an interrogative suffix.
3. The negative suffix ""janiw"" is followed by the predicate, and the vowel of the predicate is lengthened and stressed.

From this information, it is clear that the negative marker ""janiw"" is used in negative statements and is closely associated with the verb. The description suggests that ""janiw"" is a suffix that attaches to the verb, as it forms a phonological unit with the verb by affecting the vowel length and stress.

Therefore, we can conclude that standard negation in Central Aymara can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Negation Particle ""tak""**: The primary method of negating verbal predicates in Trumai involves the negation particle ""tak,"" which follows the verb or the verb plus other elements such as auxiliaries. This particle is not described as an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, it appears to be a separate word (particle) that follows the verb.

2. **Examples of Negation**:
   - (11) hai-ts chi(_in) kuhmu tak. ‘I didn’t throw it away.’
   - (13) aha sa tak. ‘I did not dance.’
   - (16) pit’a tak ka_in hai-ts hi. ‘I did not call you.’

   In these examples, ""tak"" follows the verb and is not bound to it phonologically.

3. **Privative ""t(a)ke""**: Another method of expressing a negative condition is through the use of the word ""t(a)ke"" (Privative), which indicates a permanent negative condition. However, this is not a standard negation particle but rather a word with a specific semantic function.

4. **Absence of Bound Negation**: There is no mention of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negation particle ""tak"" and the privative ""t(a)ke"" are separate words and do not form a phonological unit with the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Trumai is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the correct option is 0.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Apinayé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, it is clear that standard negation in the language can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the clitic sequence ""ket=ne"" is used to negate verbal predicates, as illustrated in the examples provided:

1. **Negation of intransitive verbal predicates**:
   - (77b) ""pa kət paj ic-pikudə ket=ne"" (I won’t get lost)
   - (78b) ""na pa a-t-ə ic-pimdir ket=ne"" (I didn’t dream about you)

2. **Negation of transitive verbal predicates**:
   - (79b) ""na Ø [i-kawə krə] katər ket=ne"" (S/he didn’t cover (the inside of) his/her basket)

These examples demonstrate that the clitic ""ket=ne"" attaches to the verb to indicate negation, fulfilling the criterion of being phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
1. The clitic ""ket=ne"" is explicitly described as being used to negate verbal predicates.
2. The examples provided show that ""ket=ne"" attaches directly to the verb, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb.
3. The negation of both intransitive and transitive verbs using ""ket=ne"" confirms that this is a standard method of negation for dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:

Yagua,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, it is evident that standard negation can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the text mentions the use of negative suffixes such as -ta, -tya, and -miy, which attach to the verb to indicate negation. For example:

- (145) ""Sjteemmitya"" (sjteenu-niy-ta) 'Isn't it true'
- (147) ""Radiitya"" (ray-diiy-ta) 'I haven't seen him/her'
- (148) ""Ramatimyty"" (ra-mui-tiy-muay) 'Therefore it isn't possible to grab (it)'

These examples clearly show that negation in Yagua can be marked by suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Cacua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that verbal negation is marked with the negation suffix **-kan**. This indicates that negation in verbs is achieved through the use of a suffix, which is a type of affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** further supports this by providing examples of verbs with the negation suffix **-kan** or **-kap**:
   - Example (33): ""kǎn=diʔ wã=pĩ-dɨw-kan=hĩ"" (I never carried him)
   - Example (34): ""ʔã=t-ɲǎk-beʔ-ep-kap-ta=be"" (maybe he didn’t scream)

These examples clearly show that the negation marker is a suffix attached to the verb, confirming that standard negation in Cacua can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuracare,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language. The relevant information is found in section 8.1.7, which discusses negative clauses.

1. **Negation Strategy**:
   - The primary method of negation involves the negative adverb ""nish"" or its phonetic variant ""nij"". This adverb is used to negate predicates or verb phrases and normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates.
   - Examples provided in the text illustrate this:
     - (35) ""nish bobo-ø=w=ya latiji"" (NEG hit;kill-3=PL=NVR subsequently) translates to ""They did not kill him then.""
     - (37) ""nish [achu imbëtë-shta-ø=w=ya]"" (NEG like.that behave-FUT-3=PL=NVR) translates to ""They will not behave like that (but otherwise).""
   - The text also mentions that this strategy is used to negate nominal and adjectival constituents, as well as adverbs and postpositional phrases, by placing the negative adverb before the entire verb phrase.

2. **Existential Negation**:
   - The form ""nij-ta"" (NEG-MID) is used for existential negation and functions as a predicate itself:
     - (40) ""nij-ta-jti-ø=ya emme"" (NEG-MID-HAB-3=NVR meat) translates to ""There was no meat.""
     - (40) ""nij-ta-ø=w=ya a-bontu"" (NEG-MID-3=PL=NVR 3SG.P-son:PL) translates to ""Her sons were not there.""

3. **Analysis**:
   - The negative adverb ""nish/nij"" and the form ""nij-ta"" are described as preceding the verb or verb phrase they negate. There is no indication that these negative markers are affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they appear to function as separate words (particles) that precede the verb.
   - The examples and descriptions do not provide evidence of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

Given the information provided, it is clear that standard negation in Yuracare is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by a separate negative adverb that precedes the verb or verb phrase.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Kuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, it is evident that standard negation in Kuna can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs describe the use of the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) to negate verbs in sentences. This suffix is attached directly to the verb stem or immediately following the aspect suffix, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs that support this conclusion:

1. **Negative Suffix Usage**: The negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is explicitly described as being added to the verb to negate a sentence.
2. **Examples Provided**: Several examples are given where the negative suffix is attached to the verb:
   - ""An immal pakchul."" ('I did not buy a thing.')
   - ""An mol peichuli."" ('I do not want cloth.')
   - ""An nan takchajul."" ('I did not see Mother.')
   - ""An nebijul."" ('I don’t want to go.')
3. **Affix Bound to Verb**: The suffix is described as being attached to the verb stem or following the aspect suffix, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Kuna can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Uru,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points relevant to determining whether negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Negation Morpheme ""ana""**:
   - The morpheme ""ana"" is used to negate entire clauses as well as noun, verb, pronominal, and adjectival phrases.
   - It can occur without any morphological marking or combine with clitic elements.

2. **Examples of Negation**:
   - Example (40): ""ana k'asi tun-n-aki-cay tiks-n-aki-caysn"" (NEG water come-OB2-FU-DEC die-OB2-FU-DEC) translates to ""No water [= rain] will come, we will die."" Here, ""ana"" is used without any morphological marking.
   - Example (41): ""tomxe-ki ana-l t(a)xa-cay wir-ki"" (today-TOP NEG-CL=1 sleep-DEC I-TOP) translates to ""Today, I did not sleep."" Here, ""ana"" combines with a clitic ""-l"".
   - Example (42): ""ana-cay tuku saki"" (NEG-DEC yet cold) translates to ""It is not cold yet."" Here, ""ana"" is combined with the declarative clitic ""-cay"".

3. **Clitics and Affixes**:
   - The negation ""ana"" can be inflected with clausal clitics such as ""-cay"" (declarative) and personal clitics.
   - Example (46): ""anas hek-i pek-aca-cay"" (NEG-CL=3 who-LV want-IR-DEC) translates to ""Nobody would want it."" Here, ""ana"" is combined with a clitic ""-s"".
   - Example (47): ""ana-pini culu xala-m kuna-cu-cay"" (NEG-AFF what lama-CL=2 kill-PST2-DEC) translates to ""We [certainly] did not kill any lama."" Here, ""ana"" is combined with the affirmative clitic ""-pini"".

From these examples and descriptions, it is clear that the negation ""ana"" can be marked by clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb or other elements within the clause. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation ""ana"" can be combined with clitics such as ""-l"", ""-cay"", and ""-pini"", which are phonologically bound to the verb or other elements in the clause.
- The examples provided show that these clitics are used in conjunction with ""ana"" to form negative constructions.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Camsá,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Negation of Verbs:**
   - In section 9.3.2, the example (10b) shows the verb ""j-obenan"" (be able to) in its negative form ""ndoñ ketsatoben."" Here, the verb is negated using the prefix ""ke-"" and an additional prefix ""at-"" closer to the verb stem. This indicates that negation is marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.
   - The gloss for (10b) is:
     ```
     ndoñ ke-ts-at-oben
     NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-be.able
     ‘I can’t.’
     ```
     This clearly shows the use of bound morphemes for negation.

2. **Negation with ""tonday"":**
   - In section 9.3.3, the word ""tonday"" is used for negation in various contexts, including preceding nouns and adjectives. However, it is not explicitly shown to be phonologically bound to verbs in the provided examples. The examples (11a) to (11d) demonstrate ""tonday"" preceding nouns and adjectives, but not verbs directly.

### Reasoning:
The example in section 9.3.2 (10b) provides clear evidence that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. The prefixes ""ke-"" and ""at-"" are attached to the verb stem to indicate negation, satisfying the criteria for this feature.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from section 9.3.2, standard negation in Camsá can indeed be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.
2. Therefore, the chosen option is:

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Warao,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negation Marker**: The negation in Warao is expressed by means of the suffix **-naka** 'NEG'.
2. **Attachment**: The negative marker **-naka** 'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root.
3. **Example**: The text mentions that once **-naka** 'NEG' has been added to the verb root, other inflectional markers for number and aspect/tense appear on the auxiliary verb **ta** 'AUX'.

Given this information, it is clear that the standard negation in Warao is marked by an affix (specifically, a suffix) that is phonologically bound to the verb. This meets the criteria for coding the language as 1 for this feature.

### Reasoning:
- The negation marker **-naka** is described as a suffix.
- It is explicitly stated that **-naka** attaches directly to the verb root.
- This attachment forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the requirement for being considered an affix.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cuiba, we can determine that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The examples provided in the ""Declarative Negative"" section show the use of ""jopa"" as a negation marker. For instance:
   - ""Neg: jopa S: huaca ©): naca P: sinayo"" translates to ""not—the-bird—us—bite-he-not"" (The bird doesn’t bite us).
   - ""Neg: jopa -C25: duhueiyo"" translates to ""not—meat—not"" (It is not meat).

   These examples indicate that ""jopa"" is used as a negation marker, but it is not clear from this paragraph alone whether ""jopa"" is an affix, clitic, or a separate particle.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides more detailed information about the verb group clitics. Specifically, it mentions:
   - ""VbClit 20 = -yo ‘negative’""
   - ""VbClit 80 = -in- ‘negative (imperative)’""

   The presence of clitics such as ""-yo"" and ""-in-"" that are explicitly marked as negative and are phonologically bound to the verb confirms that negation in Cuiba can indeed be marked by an affix or clitic.

Given this information, we can conclude that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Apurinã,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Morphological Negation**:
   - Apurinã uses a negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" for morphological negation. This marker is described as forming part of the verb, as seen in the example:
     ```
     kuki-nhi m-areka-kati-nhi
     man-AFFECT NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT die
     ‘The man who is bad died.’
     ```
   - The marker ""m(a)-"" is comparable to English negative prefixes like un-, in-, and non-, indicating that it is an affix attached to the verb.

2. **Periphrastic Negation**:
   - Apurinã also uses a periphrastic negation particle ""kona"" which can precede or follow a pre-verbal constituent. Examples include:
     ```
     nota kona sa-ru
     1SG not go-3M.O
     ‘I’m not going there.’
     ```
   - The particle ""kona"" can also undergo phonological shortening to forms like /a/ or /n/ in certain speech varieties, but it remains a separate particle rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that Apurinã employs both morphological negation (with the affix ""m(a)-"") and periphrastic negation (with the particle ""kona""). The morphological negation marker ""m(a)-"" is an affix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The morphological negation marker ""m(a)-"" is explicitly described as an affix that attaches to verbs, making it a phonologically bound element.
- The periphrastic negation particle ""kona"" is not phonologically bound to the verb and can be considered a separate word.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Kadiwéu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kadiwéu, it is clear that standard negation in Kadiwéu can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The evidence for this is found in the descriptions of the negation markers:

- The proclitic +aG attaches to the verb of the main clause (e.g., ""aG+y-ema:n:"" in example (75)).
- The negator daGa~+ attaches to the left of a complementizer (e.g., ""me+daGa"" in example (76)).
- The negation/mood marker nG+ is attached to imperative and conditional clauses (e.g., ""nG+a-alokon-d-i"" in example (78)).

These markers are described as being attached to verbs or other elements in the clause, indicating that they are phonologically bound to the verb or other constituents.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Karajá,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Negative Morpheme**: The basic negative morpheme in Karajá is `-ko)`, which is suffixed to the verb to negate the entire sentence. This is clearly shown in example (73):
   ```
   Î´kI Oha) ∅-r-I-rOèko) koè) r-e
   he armadillo 3-CTFG-TRANS-eat=NEG=CTFG-IMPERF
   ‘He doesn’t eat armadillo.’
   ```

2. **Negative Particle**: The negative morpheme `-ko)` can also occur with the pro-form `ado)` (♀) or `ao)` (♂), forming a negative particle that negates individual constituents of the sentence or is used in answers to yes/no questions. This is illustrated in examples (74) and (75b):
   ```
   dIar´) ao ao)ko ko,) kaièÎa)ko)
   I NEG you=ASSERT
   ‘Not me, but you instead.’
   ```

3. **Emphatic Negation**: An emphatic morpheme `hÈkÈ` (♂hÈkÈ) can occur with `ado)ko)` or a verb to convey strong negation, as shown in example (75d):
   ```
   ao)ko)-hÈkÈ
   NEG-EMPH
   ‘Not at all.’
   ```

From the information provided, it is clear that standard negation in Karajá can be marked by an affix (the suffix `-ko)` attached to the verb). This suffixed form is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined in the guidelines.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative morpheme `-ko)` is suffixed to the verb, indicating that it is an affix.
- The examples provided show that this suffix is used to negate the entire sentence, which is a clear indication of standard negation.
- The presence of the negative particle formed with `ado)` or `ao)` does not negate the fact that the suffix `-ko)` is used for standard negation when attached to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
