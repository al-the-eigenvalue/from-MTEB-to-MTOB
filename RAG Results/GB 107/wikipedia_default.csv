Supyire,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Supyire can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 15 mentions that there are two major kinds of negative marking in the auxiliary position: the addition of a copula ""pye"" or a floating low tone that docks onto the auxiliary. This indicates that negation can be marked by modifying the auxiliary verb.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negative clauses where the final negative particle ""mi"" is used, and the auxiliary ""pye"" is added before the progressive or perfect auxiliary to signal negation early in the clause.
- Paragraph 9 describes the formation of negative clefts by placing the focused item at the head of the clause followed by the negative identifier ""bä"" and the final negative marker ""mi"" or ""mä"".
- Paragraph 5 states that negation in Supyire involves various types of negative marking in simple clauses, including marking in the auxiliary position and clause-final negative particles.
- Paragraph 26 explains that negation is doubly marked in the clause, with a clause-final negative particle and marking in the auxiliary position, either by adding a copula or a tonal marking.

These points collectively indicate that negation in Supyire involves modifications to the verb or auxiliary, as well as the use of affixes or clitics.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jamsay,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 3**: It mentions the use of suffixes for negation in both perfective and imperfective systems. Specifically, the Perfective Negative is marked by the suffix -li@-, and the Imperfective Negative by the suffix -go@-.
  
- **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of negative inflected verbs, such as bE$rE$-go@-w ‘You-Sg cannot’ and ya$˘-li@˘-Ø ‘We did not go’, confirming the use of suffixes for negation.

- **Paragraph 6**: It shows the use of the suffix -go@- for Imperfective Negative, as in de$ne$-go@-m ‘I don’t want’.

- **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the use of the suffix -la@- for negating adjectives and stative predicates, such as e$l-la@-Ø ‘It isn’t sweet’.

- **Paragraph 19**: It reiterates the use of -go@- for Imperfective Negative and mentions that -a@˘ra$- and -tç@ƒç$- may also be followed by -la@- for negation.

These examples clearly indicate that negation in Jamsay can be marked by suffixes attached to the verb, which qualifies as phonologically bound morphemes.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ma'di,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ma'di can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple instances where negation is marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb or modify the verb directly. For example:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of negative particles such as ""kö"" or ""kûrù"" which co-occur with verbs to express negation.
- Paragraph 4 discusses how ""kü"" (nonpast) and ""kûrù"" (past) are used to negate verbs, indicating that these particles are phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 8 further elaborates on the use of ""ku"" and ""kûrù"" as negation particles that are placed at the end of the sentence, indicating that they are bound to the verb and affect its interpretation.
- Paragraph 21 explicitly states that the verb is negated by a sentence-final negation word ""kü"" or ""kûrù,"" and the verb must be uninflected, showing that these particles are directly modifying the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Ma'di involves particles that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Bangime,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Bangime can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several key points:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb to negate it. This indicates that the negation is directly associated with the verb.
- **Paragraph 3** discusses the tonal and segmental effects of the negative marker with a verb, further indicating that the negation is closely tied to the verb.
- **Paragraph 4** provides examples of intransitive verbs with the [–r] suffix in both incompletive and completive negative forms, showing that the verb stem changes in the presence of negation.
- **Paragraph 6** describes how the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb and affects the verb’s tone and inflectional class, indicating a modification of the verb.
- **Paragraph 9** summarizes that the negative marker [bíè] serves to negate both nouns and verbs, and specifically mentions that it only precedes a verb, showing a direct modification or attachment to the verb.

These points collectively demonstrate that negation in Bangime involves either a modification of the verb or the use of a negative marker that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Gumuz,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, it is evident that standard negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions the existence of negative clitics /=ŋgó/ and /=cê/ that attach to main clause verbs. Paragraph 6 further supports this by stating that the negative clitic =ŋgó is used for main clause verbs. Additionally, Paragraph 17 provides examples of verbs with the negative clitic =ŋgó attached to them, such as ""éé-s-á-na=ŋgó"" and ""á-a-ŋár-agá-kʼo=ŋgó."" These examples clearly show that negation in Gumuz can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Koyra Chiini as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that simple negative clauses are expressed in the unmarked indicative mood and that the negative morpheme itself is the only indication of the truth-value status of the underlying proposition. This suggests that negation is marked by a specific morpheme.

2. **Paragraph 5** indicates that the negative form ""sii"" is used as a locational quasi-verb meaning 'not be (present), be absent'. This implies that ""sii"" is a negative morpheme used in certain contexts.

3. **Paragraph 9** lists the morphemes used for ordinary (clause-internal) negation, specifically mentioning ""si"" and ""sii"". This confirms that these morphemes are used for negation.

4. **Paragraph 15** provides a detailed description of the MAN (Mood-Aspect-Negation) system, listing ""si"" as the marker for indicative imperfective negative and ""na"" for indicative perfective negative. It also mentions ""ma si"" for subjunctive negative. This indicates that negation in Koyra Chiini involves specific morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 24** further clarifies that the subjunctive mood is expressed by the preverbal morpheme ""ma"", and its negative counterpart is ""ma si"". This reinforces the idea that negation involves specific morphemes attached to the verb.

6. **Paragraph 42** describes the use of ""bara"" in impersonal constructions with a following subjunctive complement, where negation is expressed inside the subjunctive clause using ""si"". This again shows that negation is marked by a morpheme attached to the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from the paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Koyra Chiini can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negative morphemes ""si"" and ""na"" are phonologically bound to the verb, and the combination ""ma si"" is used for subjunctive negation.

Seme,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of negation in the language Seme (Siamou) as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the difference between negative auxiliaries and particles in Kru languages, noting that negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order, while negative particles do not. It mentions that verbs appear uninflected in the examples provided, but does not provide clear evidence of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of negative auxiliaries and particles in Kru languages. It shows that negative auxiliaries change the word order to S(Aux)OV, while negative particles do not change the word order. However, it does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the word order in Kru languages and mentions that negative auxiliaries change the word order, while negative particles do not. It does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of negative clauses in Kru languages, showing that negative auxiliaries change the word order, while negative particles do not. It does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions that negation in Seme is generally marked by a clause-final negation particle, ""bo."" It does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph reiterates that negation in Seme is marked by a clause-final negation particle, ""bo."" It does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

7. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph provides examples of negative clauses in Seme, showing the use of the clause-final negation particle ""bo."" It does not provide specific examples of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in Seme.

8. **Paragraph 21**: This paragraph discusses the negation strategies in Seme, stating that both perfective and imperfective clauses are negated with a clause-final particle, ""bo."" It explicitly states that there is no auxiliary/particle alternation and no change in word order, and the only difference is the actual form of the verb. This indicates that negation is not marked by an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

From the provided paragraphs, it is clear that negation in Seme is generally marked by a clause-final particle ""bo,"" and there is no evidence of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Conclusion: 0",0,0
Tima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tima can be marked by both a proclitic and an enclitic that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Tima uses two obligatory negative particles: the negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic marker '-Vŋ'. These markers are external to the verb word but are phonologically bound to it.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negative declarative clauses, showing the negative proclitic 'kV-' attached to the beginning of the verb and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ' attached to the end of the verb or verb phrase. Examples include:
   - Intransitive clause: ""kɨ-n-dɪyana-dʌ-ʌŋ"" (NEG-1sg-laugh-1sg-NEG) meaning ""I did not laugh.""
   - Transitive clause: ""kɨ-ŋ-kamah-dʌit̪uk-ʌŋ"" (NEG-Person-eat-1sg-porridge-NEG) meaning ""I did not eat porridge.""

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the use of the same negative markers 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in imperative, subjunctive, and veridical clauses, further confirming their role in negation.

4. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that the most common strategy of negation in Tima involves using the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in a single clause.

5. **Paragraph 5** provides additional examples of negative imperative and subjunctive forms, showing the structure NEG + IMP/SUBJ (O) + NEG.

6. **Paragraph 6** confirms that the negative particles harmonize with the verb root and are obligatory in forming grammatical negative sentences.

7. **Paragraph 10** shows examples of perfective and imperfective negation using the same negative markers, indicating their consistent use across different aspects.

### Conclusion:
1

Standard negation in Tima can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb, as evidenced by the use of the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ', which are phonologically bound to the verb.",1,1
!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the standard negation in the language !Xun (Ekoka). Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that verbal negation is fairly uniform across all dialects and that negation markers are proclitics (in case there is a verb). Specifically, the negation markers are *l6a (general negation) and *kora (negative existence). The placement of these markers is between the subject and the verb.

2. **Paragraph 18** states that verbs in !Xun take proclitics expressing tense, aspect, and modality, and they are negated by the proclitic *l6a.

3. **Paragraph 3** describes that negative imperatives are formed by placing the verb *nllan ‘leave, let go’ before the main verb, indicating a serial verb construction.

4. **Paragraph 14** provides an example where the negation marker (NEG) is placed between the subject and the verb, showing that the negation marker is a proclitic.

5. **Paragraph 35** provides an example where the negation marker and the verb are separated by an adverb, indicating that the negation marker is not an affix but a separate entity that precedes the verb.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) involves the use of proclitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negation marker *l6a is a proclitic that attaches to the verb phrase, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from the paragraphs, standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) can be marked by a proclitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Katcha,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Katcha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. This conclusion is drawn from several pieces of evidence:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative imperative form and the verb acɔ, suggesting that negation involves the verb directly.
- Paragraph 26 provides examples of verbs with the passive suffix -tené and the unaccusative suffix -nca, indicating that Katcha uses suffixes to modify verbs for different grammatical purposes, including negation.
- Paragraph 37 discusses passive morphology and how it affects the verb, further supporting the idea that Katcha uses verb modification for grammatical functions.

These examples collectively indicate that Katcha employs verb modification, including the use of suffixes, to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ijo (Kolokuma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ijo (Kolokuma) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 states that sentences are made negative by the introduction of the marker ""-a"" between the last verb and the aspect marker. This indicates that negation is achieved through an affix that attaches to the verb. Additionally, examples such as ""a b6-a"" (she did not come) and ""a b6-a, fa-qjmi"" (she will not come) further illustrate that the negation marker ""-a"" is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Emai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions the use of segmental morphemes for negative aspect, including Perfect Negation (ì), Prospective Negation (khà), and Past Absolute Negation (yà). These morphemes are phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by the examples provided in the paragraphs.

For instance, in Paragraph 1:
- ""Perfect Negation (NEG) is expressed by low tone ì. In third person monotransitive clauses, verb tone is low (è), and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high í follows a lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).""
- ""Prospective Negation (PRONEG) codes events that project to a point subsequent to time of utterance. It translates ‘will not’ and relies on low tone khà.""
- ""Past Absolute Negation (PANEG) is signaled by low tone yà ‘never.’""

These examples show that negation in Emai involves specific morphemes that attach to the verb, modifying its form to express negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Ik can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that negation in Ik involves a combination of negating verbs and modal suffixes. The examples provided show the negating verbs `ńt-`, `ma-`, and `mo-` which are used in conjunction with the main verb in the irrealis mood. For instance, in example (140) ""Nta ƙod"" (`ńt-áƙó-dⁱ`), the negating verb `ńt-` is prefixed to the main verb `ƙó` (go), indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph reiterates that negation in Ik is signaled by negator verbs (`ńt-`, `ma-/na-`) and irrealis marking on the negated verb. It further explains that these negator verbs fill the syntactic slot for the main verb and take modal suffixes, confirming that negation involves affixes or modifications to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 21**: This paragraph provides additional examples of negation with the negator verbs `ma-/na-` and the irrealis marking on the main verb. For example, ""Maa naa ƙod"" (`má-á=naaƙó-dⁱ`) shows the negator verb `ma-` combined with the main verb `ƙó` (go), again indicating that negation is marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

4. **Paragraph 1**: Although this paragraph discusses independent polarity particles (`ee/éé` for 'yes' and `ńtóodó` for 'no'), it mentions the negator verb `ńt-` within the particle `ńtóodó`, suggesting that negation can be part of a morphological complex involving the verb.

5. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions that negated imperatives (prohibitives) involve the negating verbs `ma-/na-` and the particle `eʝá` plus the negated verb as a complement in the realis mood, further supporting the use of affixes or modifications to the verb for negation.

### Conclusion: 1

Standard negation in the language Ik can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Ngiti,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 2** mentions that the negative marker for the Imperfective aspect is ""inzi,"" which precedes the Imperative verb form. This indicates that negation can be marked by a prefix (i.e., an affix) attached to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 4** elaborates on the negative markers ""inzi,"" ""inza,"" and ""imba,"" explaining their positions in the sentence. It states that when used non-initially, the initial vowel ""i-"" is deleted, resulting in forms like ""nzi,"" ""nza,"" and ""mba."" This suggests that these negative markers can be affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 11** discusses the use of negative markers ""inzi"" and ""inzé"" with different aspects (Imperfective and Perfective). The negative marker ""inzi"" is used with the Imperfective aspect, while ""inzé"" correlates with the Perfective aspect. This further supports the idea that negation is marked by affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 26** provides examples of sentences where the negative marker ""inzi"" is used with verbs, such as ""inzi ma m-obhi"" (I have not cultivated the field). This clearly shows the negative marker as a prefix attached to the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions the negative suffix `-kki` which is always attached to the verb of a subordinate clause. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix on the verb.

2. **Paragraph 3**: It refers to the negation clitic `di=` and the negative imperative suffix. The clitic `di=` attaches to verbs and other constituents, indicating that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4**: It provides an example of the negative imperative suffix `-tooti` attached to the verb, further supporting the use of affixes for negation.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It discusses the imperative suffixes, including negative imperative forms, which are affixes attached to verbs.

5. **Paragraph 9**: It shows examples of the negative proclitic `di=` attached to verbs, indicating that negation can be marked by a clitic.

6. **Paragraph 12**: It provides examples of the negative clitic `di=` attached to verbs in relative clauses.

7. **Paragraph 13**: It mentions the negative suffix `-kki` used in adverbial clauses, which is attached to the verb.

8. **Paragraph 19**: It discusses the negative suffix `-kki` used in various subordinate clauses, attached to the verb.

9. **Paragraph 20**: It provides examples of the negative clitic `di=` attached to verbs in different contexts.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Sidaama can be marked by both an affix (e.g., `-kki`, `-tooti`) and a clitic (e.g., `di=`) that are phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, the method of standard negation in Sidaama involves modifications of the verb through affixes and clitics.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mursi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, it is clear that standard negation in Mursi can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that verbs in the imperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó], and verbs in the perfective aspect are negated by the independent perfective negative particle ŋànì plus the negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root.
- Paragraph 11 provides a table (Table 13.1) showing the structure of imperfective verb negators, indicating the use of circumclitics (ŋà= and =ó) for negation.
- Paragraph 13 discusses the negation of copula clauses and mentions the use of the negative circumclitic ŋà=…=ó for negating copula verbs.
- Paragraph 16 further elaborates on the use of circumclitics for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect and enclitics for negating verbs in the perfective aspect.

These examples demonstrate that Mursi employs both affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb for marking standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Majang,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Majang can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide clear examples of this:

- **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of a fully inflectable auxiliary ""k-"" for creating negative sentences in conjunction with negative verbal nouns. This auxiliary takes the place of the verb in the clause, and the lexical negative verb form follows later as a complement.
  
  Example V.85:
  - a) nɛ kìr cɛːnà gájɛːL òláːtL bàŋɛ.
    - CONJ NEG-3P 3S-DAT succeed-NEG things\NOM all
    - ""All things will fail him.""
  - b) nɛ ɔ̀kɔ̀n kí bóŋíːɗǐŋ ...
    - CONJ if NEG-3S take-NEG=CND
    - ""If she refuses it, …""

- **Paragraph 10** further elaborates on the negative auxiliary ""k-"" and its inflection for different persons. It also mentions that the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, indicating a consistent morphological process.

  Example IV.268:
  - 1S kà pàːkkà
  - 2S kín pàːkkà
  - 3S kí pàːkkà
  - 1P kíː pàːkkà
  - 2P kí *ːr pàːkkà
  - 3P kír pàːkkà
    - ""I am not hot, you are not hot, it is not hot, we are not hot, you are not hot, they are not hot.""

- **Paragraph 12** discusses the necessity of the negative auxiliary ""k-"" preceding the negative verb forms and mentions that negative verb formation is based on the formation of infinitives, with specific suffixes used for the negative form.

  Example IV.117:
  - base stem: gírgíɗíː
  - infinitive: gírgíɗeːt
  - negative: gírgíɗíːt
    - ""roll""

  Example IV.118:
  - root: càw
  - infinitive: càwɛːL
  - negative: càwɛːɗ
    - ""sprinkle""

These examples clearly show that negation in Majang involves morphological changes to the verb, including the use of affixes and clitics.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Birri,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Birri. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions:
   - ""Neg. ini agbb-sa (pr. ina gbb-sa).""
   - ""ca — sa — sha negative particle, to be found at the end of negative statements.""

2. **Paragraph 3** states:
   - ""b) ca, sa, sha the negative particle always placed at the end of the statements; a great number of examples have already been supplied.""

3. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of imperative negation:
   - ""Do not steal o’o idi sa.""
   - ""Do not smoke opium, aya bangi shd; pl. maya bangi shd.""
   - ""Do not go awa sa-, pl. mawa sa.""

4. **Paragraph 6** gives examples of negation in declarative sentences:
   - ""It is not big ukama fe-shd, pl. ukdkdmd fe-sha.""
   - ""No i ^ya fre-shd.""

5. **Paragraph 11** shows negation in verb conjugation:
   - ""monyo di-sa"" (I do not eat)
   - ""anyone (i)di-sa"" (he/she/it does not eat)

From these points, we can conclude that standard negation in Birri is marked by the negative particles ""sa"" or ""sha,"" which are phonologically bound to the verb. These particles are used consistently at the end of negative statements, indicating that negation is achieved through an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Tamashek,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine how standard negation is marked in Tamashek. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that the normal imperfective negative construction consists of ""waer"" plus a special LoImpfN stem, which is a negative variant of the LoImpfP. This indicates that the verb stem itself is modified to indicate negation.

2. **Paragraph 4**: It lists the basic verb stems, including the Perfective Negative (PerfN) and Long Imperfective Negative (LoImpfN), which occur after the negative preverb ""waer"". This suggests that negation involves specific negative verb forms.

3. **Paragraph 8**: It reiterates that the specifically negative stems (PerfN, LoImpfN, Prohib) occur after the negative preverb ""waer"". This confirms that negation involves both a preverb and a modified verb stem.

4. **Paragraph 11**: It details the phonological modifications of verbs after the negative particle ""waer"". For example, in the perfective, the verb stem undergoes a vocalic substitution to form the PerfN stem. In the imperfective, the LoImpfN stem is characterized by specific phonological changes such as the absence of certain ablaut features and the imposition of a strict melody.

5. **Paragraph 14**: It describes participles built on the negative particle ""waer"", where the verb follows the participialized negative particle. This further supports the idea that negation involves both a preverb and a modified verb form.

6. **Paragraph 15**: It provides examples of the negative participial forms, showing that the verb form changes when negated.

7. **Paragraph 17**: It discusses the future negative participles, where the negative morpheme precedes the future particle, and the participial endings are added to this combination, indicating a complex interaction between negation and verb modification.

8. **Paragraph 18**: It mentions that the combination of the past particle ""kaela"" with the negative particle ""waer"" plus the PerfN stem is used to denote a temporally extended negative state.

9. **Paragraph 19**: It provides examples of the negative forms used as negative equational copulas and in negative identificational clauses.

10. **Paragraph 20**: It describes the use of the negative particle ""waer"" in various contexts, including with the future particle and in negative imperatives.

### Conclusion: 1

Standard negation in Tamashek can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence shows that negation involves the use of a negative particle ""waer"" combined with specific negative verb forms (PerfN, LoImpfN, Prohib), which are modifications of the verb stem.",1,1
Coptic,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Coptic can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly describe the use of negative prefixes, suffixes, and auxiliary verbs that are phonologically bound to the verb to indicate negation.

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the double negation strategy ""n- ... an,"" where ""n-"" is a negative prefix and ""an"" is a clause-internal negation adverb. This indicates that negation involves a prefix attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 3** discusses negative conjugation patterns that include negative affixes and auxiliary verbs, such as the negative auxiliary verb ""tm"" ('to do not'), which is used to form negative tenses.
- **Paragraph 5** further elaborates on the double negation ""n- ... an,"" where ""n-"" is a prefix attached to the verb, and ""an"" is an adverb within the clause.
- **Paragraph 9** describes negative tenses marked by a morpheme-initial labial or velar nasal ""w-"" or ""n-,"" indicating that these prefixes are used to form negative conjugation patterns.
- **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negative tenses where the negative marker is merged with the tense-aspect-mood marker into a single morph, such as ""n- ... an"" and the negative auxiliary verb ""tm.""
- **Paragraph 14** mentions the negative auxiliary verb ""tm"" and its use in forming negative tenses, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

These examples clearly show that Coptic uses affixes and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Igbo can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Affixation of Negative Suffix**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly mentions that ""The negative counterpart of these are realized by the affixation of the general negative suffix =ghI, to the auxiliary verb, or main verb, as the case may be, with the attendant tonal patterns determined by the verb form.""
   - This indicates that the negative suffix =ghI is attached to the verb, marking negation.

2. **Inherently Negative Inflectional Suffixes**:
   - Paragraph 6 states, ""While constituent negation is marked morphosyntactically, sentential marking is marked by negative auxiliaries, and, inherently negative inflectional suffixes, especially suffixes.""
   - This further supports the presence of suffixes that are inherently negative and attach to verbs.

3. **Examples of Negative Suffix Usage**:
   - Paragraph 14 provides examples of the negative infinitive form, where the negative suffix =ghi is used:
     - (i) é-rī-ghi (not eating)
     - (ii) a-zà-ghì (not sweeping)
   - These examples show the negative suffix =ghi being used directly with the verb.

4. **Negative Markers in Different Tenses**:
   - Paragraph 21 discusses the use of the negative marker =ghi in various tense forms, indicating its consistent use in marking negation across different verb forms.

5. **Negative Imperative Suffix**:
   - Paragraph 38 describes the negative imperative form, which includes the negative imperative suffix =la/le:
     - ""The verb always has the harmonizing negative imperative suffix =la/le in the underlying structure.""

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Igbo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
2. **Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Mambai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses negative subject pronouns that exhibit a CVV shape and tonal modifications (LH for Perfective and HL for non-Perfective forms). Examples include ""mìí"" for 1SG:PFV.NEG and ""míì"" for 1SG:NONPFV.NEG. These pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions the use of negation particles ""yá"" and ""gá"". The particle ""yá"" is used with Indicative verb forms and is a clitic that attaches to the verb, as shown in examples like ""mìí làà yá"" (1SG:PFV.NEG eat:PFV NEG). The particle ""gá"" is used with Optative verb forms, as in ""mú hèè gá"" (2SG:OPT climb:OPT NEG:OPT). These particles are phonologically bound to the verb, further supporting that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic.

- **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the use of the negative particle ""yá"" in clause-final position and mentions modifications of subject pronouns to mark negation. Examples include ""míì té’là yá"" (1SG:NONPFV.NEG walk:VN NEG), showing that negation involves both a clitic and a modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph summarizes that negative verb forms are marked with negation particles and negative subject pronouns. The table provided shows the structure of negative verb forms, confirming the use of CVV pronouns and the particle ""yá"" for different tenses.

- **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of negative Perfective and non-Perfective pronouns, such as ""mìí hèè yá"" (1SG:PFV.NEG climb:PFV NEG) and ""míì héérà yá"" (1SG:NONPFV.NEG climb:VN NEG), illustrating the use of phonologically bound elements to mark negation.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingessana,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ingessana (Gaahmg) is marked by a separate word, specifically the particle ""wá,"" which always occurs clause-finally and does not attach to the word it follows. This is clearly stated in Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, where it is mentioned that ""The negative particle wá is clause final and does not attach to the word it follows."" Additionally, Paragraph 2 reiterates that ""The negative particle wá always occurs clause-finally and modifies or negates the preceding verb, verb predicate or clause.""

Given this information, it is clear that negation in Ingessana is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself, but rather by a separate particle.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Gorowa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gorowa, it is clear that standard negation in Gorowa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 provides detailed information about the use of the negative clitic =ká(ng) which attaches to verb roots extended by the suffix -a in the present tense and -i in the past tense. This clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in the examples provided:

- Present Tense: ""tam motloo ngi xu’aká"" (She doesn’t even know tomorrow)
- Past Tense: ""inós tunáy ngu xu’iká’"" (She didn’t know of dried honey)

These examples show that the negation is marked directly on the verb through the use of the clitic =ká(ng).

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Shatt,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Shatt can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the locating near suffix –nang on verbs, as seen in the example ""kawunonang"" (‘come here’), indicating that suffixes can attach to verbs.
- Paragraph 6 discusses identifying suffixes that can be attached to verbs, such as the suffix –ang in ""kawungang"" (‘came’), showing that verbs can indeed take suffixes.
- Paragraph 22 provides examples of identity suffixes –ang attaching to verbs in dependent clauses, further supporting that verbs can be modified with suffixes.
- Paragraph 44 distinguishes between the towards suffix –äng and the identifying suffix –(a)ng, noting that the towards suffix is only on verbs, which implies that verbs can be modified by suffixes.

These points collectively demonstrate that verbs in Shatt can be modified by affixes or clitics, which can be used to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Koromfe. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Sentence negation can be marked by the negative particle ""ba"" positioned before the verb.
   - Alternatively, negation can be marked by using a negative subject pronoun, which are proclitics on the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The negative particle ""ba"" and the negative personal pronouns normally have a high tone.
   - A negative personal pronoun always shortens the long final ""aa"" of a following PROGRESSIVE verb form.

3. **Paragraph 12**:
   - There exists a special negative copula ""dJ"".

4. **Paragraph 19**:
   - The negative counterpart of the verb ""WE"" is ""1Jgo"" or ""1Jgose"".

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by:
- The negative particle ""ba"" which is positioned before the verb.
- Negative subject pronouns which are proclitics on the verb.
- The negative copula ""dJ"".
- The negative verb ""1Jgo"" or ""1Jgose"".

These methods involve either a modification of the verb (e.g., using negative subject pronouns or negative copula) or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb (e.g., proclitic negative subject pronouns).

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Nobiin,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nobiin can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 5 provide clear evidence of this:

- **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the element -min/-muun- inserted between the verbal base and the ending to form the negative present. This indicates that negation is achieved through an affix or clitic attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 5**: Describes the use of the verb men-/min- ‘not to be’ in periphrastic constructions for negation, which can follow a participle, predicative, or indicative. This shows that negation involves a modification of the verb or the addition of a negative auxiliary.

These paragraphs demonstrate that negation in Nobiin involves phonologically bound elements (affixes or clitics) attached to the verb or modifications of the verb itself.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Nyimang. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that in the 3rd Person, a specific particle replaces another only in the negative of sentences which use certain particles together. This suggests a modification or addition for negation.
2. **Paragraph 10** provides examples where the particle ""fa"" precedes the verb for negation, such as ""fa wo"" (do not know), ""fa kil"" (does not understand), and ""fa-inC:. fan.i~ kil?"" (does not understand). This indicates the use of a particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.
3. **Paragraph 39** shows the use of ""fa"" for negation in various contexts, such as ""a fa WEna"" (I don't want it), ""a fa tai"" (I am not going), and ""endu furo fa n;;on"" (She is not carrying a basket). This further supports the use of a bound particle for negation.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Nyimang can be marked by a particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The use of the particle ""fa"" directly preceding the verb in negative constructions indicates that negation is marked by a phonologically bound element.
- The examples provided show consistent use of this particle to negate verbs, fitting the criteria for standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Lamé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Lamé is marked by the use of the negative markers ""tsú"" and ""mì."" These markers are not affixes or clitics that attach to the verb, nor do they modify the verb itself. Instead, ""tsú"" appears immediately after the subject noun or pronoun, and ""mì"" appears at the end of the clause. This pattern is consistent across various tenses and aspects, as demonstrated in the examples provided.

For instance:
- ""Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə bə̀kà mì"" (Tau didn’t go to the market this morning)
- ""tá tsú gí tsoɓ mbìr mì"" (she does not sell milk)
- ""mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì"" (he never buys (what is) mine)

These examples show that the negation markers ""tsú"" and ""mì"" are separate words and not phonologically bound to the verb. They do not function as affixes or clitics that attach to the verb, nor do they modify the verb itself.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Bininj Gun-Wok,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Bininj Gun-Wok can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

2. The reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:

- **Paragraph 2** explicitly mentions the use of negative particles such as ""marrek"" and ""bayun"" in combination with the non-past tense to form negative imperatives. This indicates that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negative imperatives using the particle ""bayun"" and ""marrek"" directly before the verb, showing that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 11** discusses the use of the negative particle ""djama"" in combination with verbs, further supporting the use of particles in negation.

- **Paragraph 12** mentions the use of the irrealis mood in negation, which involves modifying the verb form to express negation.

- **Paragraph 13** provides examples of negative particles ""marrek"" and ""bayun"" used with verbs, indicating that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 14** discusses the use of the negative particle ""djama"" in combination with verbs, showing that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 15** mentions the use of the negative particle ""djama"" with verbs, indicating that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 16** provides examples of negative particles ""marrek"" and ""bayun"" used with verbs, showing that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wambaya,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Wambaya can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 5 mentions that the negative particles ""guyala"" and ""yangula"" usually require the presence of the hypothetical suffix in the auxiliary in future clauses. This indicates that negation involves some modification of the auxiliary verb, which is closely tied to the verb itself.
- Paragraph 7 provides an example where the negative particle ""yangula"" appears with the simple future tense suffix ""-u"" on the verb, showing that negation can involve a suffix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 16 states that in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form, indicating a modification of the verb form itself in the context of negation.
- Paragraph 22 shows an example of a negative imperative construction where the verb appears without future tense marking, again indicating a modification of the verb in the context of negation.

These examples collectively demonstrate that negation in Wambaya can involve modifications to the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wardaman,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Negative Particles**: The paragraphs frequently mention the use of negative particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" to negate verbs. These particles are described as clausal negators that generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb or between a particle and a finite verb (Paragraph 3, Paragraph 5, Paragraph 10).

2. **Irrealis Forms**: The language uses irrealis forms of verbs in conjunction with negative particles to express negation, particularly for modal meanings like prohibition, incapacity, or counterfactuality (Paragraph 2, Paragraph 9, Paragraph 14).

3. **Examples of Negation**: Multiple examples illustrate the use of negative particles with verbs:
   - ""wonggo ya-yi-0-nyja"" (No, he mayn't go) (Paragraph 1)
   - ""wonggo nu-bu-n"" (you are not killing it) (Paragraph 5)
   - ""wonggo yi-ni-jingi-n"" (Don't sit down!) (Paragraph 6)
   - ""wonggo yi-nganja"" (I may not/cannot/ought not go) (Paragraph 3)

4. **Negation of Nominal Phrases**: The particle ""wonggo"" is also used to negate nominal phrases, indicating its broad applicability in negation (Paragraph 15).

5. **Clausal Particles and Interjections**: The language has a variety of clausal particles and interjections that can express negation or related meanings, such as ""nganayu"" (let it be, no) (Paragraph 35).

### Conclusion

From the analysis, it is clear that standard negation in Wardaman can be marked by a negative particle (wonggo or warna) that is phonologically bound to the verb. These particles are used in conjunction with verbs to negate declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by affixes or modifications of the verb itself, but the use of negative particles directly preceding or within the verb phrase is well-documented.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Gooniyandi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Gooniyandi can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami"" for negation, but it does not provide clear evidence of these being affixes or clitics attached to verbs.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples where ""mangaddi"" is used as a negative particle, indicating that it modifies the proposition rather than attaching to the verb as an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 3 discusses ""mar/ami"" and its use in negation, but again, it functions as a separate particle rather than an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 4 explicitly states that ""mangaddi"" is a negative particle and not a VP constituent, reinforcing that it is not an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 6 provide further examples of ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami"" being used as separate particles.
- Paragraph 7 mentions the use of ""mangaddi"" in negated irrealis subjunctive clauses, but it does not indicate that it is an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 9 discuss the use of ""mangaddi"" in various contexts, but consistently as a separate particle.
- Paragraph 10 and Paragraph 11 further reinforce the use of ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami"" as separate particles.
- Paragraph 12 and Paragraph 13 discuss the use of ""woomoorla"" in avoidance style, which also functions as a separate particle.
- Paragraph 14 and Paragraph 15 discuss the use of negation in different contexts but do not provide evidence of affixes or clitics.
- Paragraph 16 and Paragraph 17 discuss the use of negation in proposals and commands, but again, as separate particles.
- Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 discuss the use of negation in various contexts, but consistently as separate particles.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that negation in Gooniyandi is primarily marked by separate particles such as ""mangaddi,"" ""mar/ami,"" and ""woomoorla,"" rather than by affixes or clitics attached to verbs.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Tiwi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Tiwi can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the use of the irrealis prefix in negative contexts and the presence of negative particles that interact with verb morphology indicate that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative particle ""ngajiti"" and the irrealis prefix in negative contexts, which suggests that negation can be marked on the verb.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples where the irrealis prefix is used in negative sentences, such as ""karluwu awungani yi-rri-mi"" ('He wasn't like that') and ""ngarra karluwu ji-rri-kuruwala"" ('He didn't sing'), indicating that the verb is modified to express negation.
- Paragraph 6 also discusses the use of the irrealis prefix in negative contexts, reinforcing the idea that negation can be marked on the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Tiwi involves modifications to the verb, either through prefixes or other morphological changes.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nakkara,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Nakkara can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 4**: The negative prefix ""ka-"" is mentioned as part of the verb complex in negative constructions. The example ""Korla kabarrddjomna keyarda"" shows the use of ""ka-"" as a prefix to the verb stem ""ddjorna"" (go back), indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 6**: The negative particle ""korla"" is used in conjunction with negative verb forms. The example ""Korla kabarrddjomna keyarda"" again shows the use of ""ka-"" as a prefix to the verb stem, reinforcing that negation involves a modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 11**: The negative affix ""-ma"" is discussed as part of the verb complex in negative constructions. The example ""Korla ngaybburdama"" shows the use of ""-ma"" as a suffix to the verb stem ""bburda"" (hit), indicating that negation is marked by an affix.

- **Paragraph 21**: The negative prefix ""ka-"" is mentioned again, with the example ""Korla barriddjornama keyarda"" showing the use of ""ka-"" and ""-ma"" as part of the verb complex in negative constructions.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Nakkara can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Garrwa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Affixation and Clitics**: Paragraph 4 explicitly mentions that in negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form with the suffix -kanyi (example 9.95). Additionally, the negative particle miku can be followed by second-position clitic elements, including pronouns and modal clitics, which are phonologically bound to the verb (examples 9.95, 9.99, 9.100). This indicates that clitics are used in the construction of negation.
  
- **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 4 also states that in negative non-past contexts, verbs take the irrealis form, which is a modification of the verb to indicate negation (example 9.95).

- **Examples of Clitics**: Paragraph 5 provides examples where the negative particle miku is combined with clitics such as =kiya (obligation) and =wali (evidential), which are phonologically bound to the verb (examples 8.119, 8.130, 8.131).

- **Negation in Past Contexts**: Paragraph 6 mentions that in past contexts, the pronoun takes the clitic =ya(nyi) for past negation (examples 9.101, 9.102), further supporting the use of clitics in negation.

- **Summary of Negation**: Paragraph 6 also summarizes that negated clauses marked with habitual aspect use irrealis verb forms, and in past contexts, the pronoun takes a past negation clitic, reinforcing the use of affixes and clitics in negation (examples 9.99, 9.100, 9.101).

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ngankikurungkurr,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 2** mentions that the verb yityi-'do' is modified by the negative particle minbe, indicating that negation can involve a modification of the verb.
- **Paragraph 3** provides examples of the negative particle minbe combining with verbs, such as in the phrase ""minbe yarra-gi"" (Neg 2plPokeDtr-Mp-side-Val-place), showing that negation can be marked by a particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 5** describes the use of the negative particle minbe- suffixed with a generic, as in ""match minbe-yenggi"" (Neg - fire), indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.
- **Paragraph 16** discusses the negative particle minbe/minde(K) attracting verbal enclitics, such as the temporal focus marker -nyine/-kana(K) and the past and future tense markers -tye and -pe/-ngini(K), further supporting the idea that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Wagiman. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the adverb **dyamba** which is glossed as 'IRR NEG' (irrealis negative). It is used to express inability, lack of desire, or negative commands. Examples show **dyamba** preceding the verb, indicating it functions as a separate word rather than an affix or clitic bound to the verb:
   - ""dyamba gu-ya'-dya"" (IRR NEG 3sg:POT-tell-IMM) - 'He can't tell'
   - ""dyamba gi-ya"" (IRR NEG 2sg:IPFV-go) - 'Don't you go'

2. **Paragraph 3** discusses negative imperatives using the nominal privative suffix **-ne'en** attached to participles:
   - ""gatkata-ne'en"" (laugh-PRIV) - 'Don't laugh!'

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions **dyamba** again in the context of negation:
   - ""dyamba ga-ya"" (IRR NEG 3sg:IPFV-go) - 'No, I am sick.'

4. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of **dyamba** used with verbs:
   - ""dyamba gi-ya"" (IRR NEG 2sg:IPFV-go) - 'Don't go away!'

5. **Paragraph 34** shows **dyamba** used with verbs in imperative constructions:
   - ""dyamba gi-ya"" (IRR NEG 2sg:IPFV-go) - 'Don't mess around!'

From these points, we can conclude:
- **dyamba** functions as a separate word (particle) used for negation.
- The nominal privative suffix **-ne'en** is used for negating participles in imperative constructions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, standard negation in Wagiman is primarily marked by a separate word (particle) **dyamba** and not by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The privative suffix **-ne'en** is used in a specific context (negative imperatives with participles), but this does not constitute standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Thus, the correct option is:

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs describe various methods of negation, including the use of the negative particle ""la"" combined with pre-verbal particles and the negative copula ""l5le"" or ""l7le"" which are phonologically bound to the verb. These forms indicate that negation can be marked directly on the verb or through affixes/clitics.

For example, in Paragraph 2, it is mentioned that the particle ""la"" can be combined with pre-verbal particles such as ""i-"" and ""q6m-"", and the sequence can undergo phonetic changes, resulting in forms like ""le-y-pal6†"" or ""l5-pal6†"". This demonstrates that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb.

Additionally, the negative copula forms ""l5le"" and ""l7le"" are used to negate present and past copulas, respectively, as shown in Paragraph 2. These forms are phonologically bound to the verb and indicate negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
English,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in English can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 43 discusses the use of synthetic primary negation, where negation is marked by inflecting the verb in the negative form, such as ""won't"" (a contraction of ""will not""). This indicates that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 34 further supports this by distinguishing between negative inflection (synthetic negation) and contraction, providing evidence that forms like ""won't"" are considered single grammatical words and inflectional forms of ""will.""

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Korean,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korean can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of ""ani"" and ""mOs"" for negation, indicating that these can be used in conjunction with verbs to form negative sentences.
- Paragraph 6 discusses the structure ""-ci anh-"" and its shortened form ""-c'anh-"", which are used in rhetorical negative questions. This indicates that the negative marker ""-anh-"" is attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 11 explicitly states that an affirmative sentence can be turned into a negative using ""ani"" or ""mOs"", and provides examples such as ""Ponta + ani"" and ""Cip ita + mOs"".
- Paragraph 15 provides paradigms for the verb ""iss.ta"" and its negative forms, showing the use of ""anh.ta"" and ""mOs hata"" as negative markers that attach to the verb.
- Paragraph 19 discusses the placement of ""mOs"" in negative constructions with verbal nouns, indicating that ""mOs"" can appear between the verbal noun and the postnominal verb or before the verbal noun, showing its role as a bound element in negation.
- Paragraph 28 explains negative preemphasis by inserting particles after the suspective ""-ci"", further illustrating how negation is integrated into the verb structure.

These points collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Korean involves modifications of the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Basque,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Basque involves the use of the negative particle ""ez"" which precedes the auxiliary verb. This particle is phonologically bound to the auxiliary verb, as evidenced by examples such as ""ez da"" (not AUX) and ""ez du"" (not AUX). Additionally, there are instances where the negative particle ""ez"" causes phonological changes in the following verb, such as devoicing (e.g., ""gara"" becomes ""ezkara"" for ""we are not""). These examples indicate that negation is marked by an element that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Malayalam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 14**: ""Future negative is formed by the addition of ©§y to the verb stem.""
   - This indicates that the future negative form is created by adding a suffix to the verb stem, which is a clear example of negation being marked by an affix.

2. **Paragraph 30**: ""Negative is formed by the addition of ie§y after the tense marker. When it is added the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero.""
   - This further supports the presence of an affix (ie§y) that is added to the verb to form the negative, confirming that negation can be marked by an affix.

3. **Paragraph 23**: ""Note that in all sentence patterns in Malayalam negative statements take the suffix -^B-^ for interrogation except in some highly literary and classical styles and also in some dialects where-ao also can be added to negatives.""
   - This paragraph mentions the use of a suffix (-^B-^) in negative statements, which again indicates the use of an affix for marking negation.

4. **Paragraph 25**: ""The definite imperative and the negative imperative are formed by the addition of the suffixes-sroo and —sne to the —<BTO ending verbal nouns.""
   - This shows that negative imperatives are formed by adding a suffix (-sne) to the verb, which is another instance of negation being marked by an affix.

Given these examples, it is clear that standard negation in Malayalam can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iu Mien,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mien is marked by the negative particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv,"" which are placed immediately before verbs, including dynamic verbal predicates. There is no evidence in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negative particles ""maiv"" and ""mv"" are separate words and not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, negation in Mien cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Semelai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affix/Clitic Usage**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions the imperative negator ""boy"" followed by the verb which hosts the irrealis proclitic ""ma="" (§5.5.2). This indicates that the irrealis proclitic ""ma="" is used in negative imperative constructions, showing that negation can be marked by a proclitic attached to the verb.
   - Paragraph 47 further supports this by explaining that the proclitic ""ma="" 'IRR' occurs primarily in conjunction with transitive verbs to mark the irrealis in a range of clause types, including negative imperative clauses.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 48 provides an example of a negative imperative construction with the verb ""boy"" (NEG:IMP) followed by ""ma=yok"" (IRR=fetch), indicating that the verb is modified by the negator and the irrealis marker.

These examples clearly show that negation in Semelai can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, such as proclitics or modifications of the verb itself.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yukaghir (Kolyma) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 32 states that ""the standard sentential negation is expressed by attaching the prefix e/+ to the finite verb."" This indicates that negation is achieved through a prefix, which is a type of affix. Additionally, Paragraph 1 mentions ""the regular negative prefix,"" further supporting the use of affixes for negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Georgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Georgian, it is evident that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

The relevant information is found in Paragraph 1, which discusses the use of the negative particle ""ar"" in various contexts, including its role in negating verbs. Specifically, it mentions that past statements which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive switch to the Perfect when negated by ""ar"". This indicates that the verb form changes when negated, which is a modification of the verb to mark negation. Additionally, the use of ""ar"" as a negative particle directly attached to the verb (e.g., ""ar da-brun-d-eb-a"" meaning ""will not return"") shows that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

Paragraph 1 also provides examples of negation in different verb forms, such as ""ar mi-(Ø-)m-a-t'ov-e"" (not receive) and ""ar ga-i-rq'vn-e-s"" (not corrupt), further supporting the conclusion that negation involves modifications or affixes/clitics attached to the verb.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Alutor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the methods of standard negation in Alutor. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several methods of verbal negation, including:
   - Combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb.
   - Combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative.
   - Combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from the deverbal predicative.
   - The analytical form derived from the negative analytical representation.
   - Circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negative forms:
   - The negative particle qytymmy is used with finite verb forms in optative and conjunctive moods.
   - Examples include ""qytymmymy-vitaty-k"" (I will not work) and ""qytymmyty-@-awwavy-k"" (I would not go).

3. **Paragraph 4** mentions the use of circumfixes for negation:
   - tymNi-...-a/-ta for deriving the negative correlate of the supine.
   - a-...-kyl@in circumfix for deriving negative forms, which is then combined with the negative particle ally.

4. **Paragraph 6** discusses the use of the prefix nuN- in negative analytical forms.

From these points, we can see that standard negation in Alutor can indeed be marked by:
- **Affixes**: such as the circumfixes tymNi-...-a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in.
- **Prefix**: such as nuN-.
- **Modification of the verb**: through the use of circumfixes and prefixes.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Thai is marked by the use of a separate negative word placed before the verb. Specifically, the negative word ""MY"" (not) is used to negate verbs in declarative sentences. This is evident from multiple examples and explanations in the paragraphs:

1. Paragraph 2 states: ""A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of the verb or, in certain cases, after it.""
2. Paragraph 3 provides examples such as ""MY YOO KA"" (No, he is not in), where ""MY"" is placed before the verb ""YOO"" (to be).
3. Paragraph 12 further clarifies: ""MY DY placed in front of the verb means 'did not' and this construction is very widely used.""

There is no indication in the provided paragraphs that negation in Thai is achieved through affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself. Instead, negation is consistently shown to be marked by a separate word that precedes the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The negation in Thai is marked by the separate word ""MY"" placed before the verb.
- There is no evidence of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Nganasan,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Nganasan can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several instances throughout the provided text:

- Paragraph 4 explicitly states that ""The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the connegative form of the main verb."" This indicates that the verb is modified to express negation.
- Paragraph 3 mentions that ""The negative supine form is rarely used in the texts, but instead of this form, one of the supine markers appears on the negative auxiliary."" This further supports the idea that negation involves modification of the verb.
- Paragraph 2 discusses the use of the negative auxiliary ńisɨ and the connegative form of the main verb, showing that negation is marked on the verb.
- Paragraph 1 also provides examples of the negative auxiliary ńisɨ and the connegative form of the main verb, reinforcing the conclusion that negation is marked by modifying the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in multiple paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of suffixes in modal verb constructions, including negative modality and negation, such as ""-ʁavr-ləyə-yzu-ger-NEG"" and ""-molo-"" (not want).
- Paragraph 3 discusses the negational suffix that follows the -a-stem and mentions a special negational suffix -en.
- Paragraph 4 lists various negational forms like -ʁavr-, -ləyə-, and -yzu-.
- Paragraph 6 provides examples of negational morphemes derived from verbs, such as -qavr- and -yzu-.

These examples indicate that negation in Nivkh can indeed be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jarawa (in Andamans),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jarawa can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix `-ma` is used to mark negation directly on the verb. This is evident from several examples and explanations in the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the suffix `-ma` as an alternative to the negative word `naɖem` for clausal negation.
- Paragraph 2 explicitly states that negation in Jarawa can be expressed by using the suffix `-ma` on verbs.
- Paragraph 3 further clarifies that Jarawa uses a negative suffix to verbs in verbal clauses.
- Paragraph 6 provides an example of the negative suffix `-ma` in prohibitives.
- Paragraph 16 discusses the use of the suffix `-ma` on the verbal predicate to negate sentences.

Nahali,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nahali, it is evident that standard negation in Nahali can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Negation is marked by various forms; some preceding the verbal root, some following it."" This indicates that negation can be directly attached to the verb.
   - Examples such as ""ho:to-kappo"" ('does not/did not sleep') and ""jo beṭhe ha:goken"" ('I do not laugh') show the use of ""ho:to"" and ""beṭhe"" as negation markers that are phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Paragraph 3 further clarifies that ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:ṭo"" are used as negative markers, with ""beṭhe"" used in non-past constructions and ""ho:ṭo"" in past constructions. These markers can precede or follow the verb, and sometimes undergo assimilation with the verb, indicating they are affixes or clitics.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 3 also mentions that when ""beṭhe"" occurs before a verb, it often undergoes assimilatory changes with the following verb, such as ""beṭhe > beppa:ṭo"" ('I will not come'). This shows a modification of the verb form due to the presence of the negation marker.

3. **Examples from the Text**:
   - Paragraph 8 provides paradigms where negation is marked directly on the verb, such as ""jo beṭhe kappoka"" ('I do not sleep') and ""jo ho:to kappo"" ('I did not sleep').
   - Paragraph 11 illustrates the use of ""biji"" as a negative imperative marker, which can precede or follow the verb, further showing that negation can be directly attached to the verb.

Specifically, paragraph 4 (23.2) mentions the use of the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-, which precedes the content verb and takes various morphological forms. This indicates that negation is achieved through a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, paragraph 14 (7.3) further supports this by explaining the negative conjugation involving the negative auxiliary verb e(i)- in various temporal/aspectual/modal forms followed by the bare Present stem of the matrix verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It explicitly states that the negative morpheme in Ingush can be either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form. For tense forms, a suffix is used, while for converbs and nonfinites, a proclitic is used. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix or a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides detailed examples of how negation is applied suffixally to indicative finite verbs and proclitically to other verb forms. It mentions specific suffixes like -(â)c for present stem tenses and -(â)ndz- for past stem tenses, and proclitics like my= for imperatives and cy= for converbs and nonfinites.

3. **Paragraph 8**: It lists the tone-bearing morphemes of Ingush, including negative proclitics (cy=, my=) and suffixes (-ac, -andz-ar), reinforcing that negation can be marked by affixes or clitics.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It reiterates that negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush, with the exception of some participial forms.

5. **Paragraph 10**: It discusses the use of negation in chaining and adjunct subordination, indicating that negation is marked in the clause in its scope, often on the main verb or converb.

6. **Paragraph 12**: It describes the structure of the verb in Ingush, mentioning that negation is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic elsewhere.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Ingush can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, it is evident that standard negation in Lezgian can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly mentions that verbs are negated by the negative suffix **-δ** or by the negative prefix **tA-**. Examples provided include:
     - ""qaöu-zwa-δ"" (take-IMPF-NEG) meaning ""do not take"".
     - ""qaöu-zwa"" (take-IMPF) meaning ""take"".
   - This indicates that negation is directly marked on the verb through affixes.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It reiterates that finite indicative verb forms are negated by the suffix **-δ** (e.g., ""guzwa"" (gives) vs. ""guzwa-δ"" (does not give)).
   - Non-finite and non-indicative verb forms are negated by prefixal negation, involving the negative auxiliary **t-awun** or the negative prefix **t(A)-**.

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Provides examples of verbs with negative forms using the prefix **tA-**:
     - ""te-fi-n"" (NEG-go) meaning ""not going"".
     - ""te-fi-ra"" (NEG-go) meaning ""not to go"".

These examples clearly show that standard negation in Lezgian involves modifications of the verb through affixes or prefixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide clear examples of negative suffixes attached to verbs to indicate negation. Here are some key points:

- **Paragraph 1**: The example ""tekite-ksail-nguq=wa"" (arrive-NEG-PTP.3sg.=REA) and ""tekite-ksait-uq"" (arrive-NEG-IND.3sg.) show the use of the negative suffix ""-ksait-"" attached to the verb to indicate negation.
- **Paragraph 3**: Discusses various VVn suffixes of negation, including |-nћլit-| ‘not’, |-ksait-| ‘not yet’, and others, which are used to negate verbs.
- **Paragraph 4**: Provides an example ""ayag-ciqe-nrit-ua"" (I will not go) where the negative suffix ""-nrit-"" is used.
- **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the negative appositional mood marker |-1na-| used after generally negative suffixes.
- **Paragraph 6**: Examples like ""ayaћ-ksait[-1nani|"" (he not leaving yet) and ""pi-ksait[-1nani|"" (he not doing yet) show the use of the negative suffix ""-ksait-"" in appositional forms.
- **Paragraph 10**: The example ""pi-liqe-rrlainar-pek’-nateng"" (they do not always catch game) shows the use of the negative suffix ""-pek’-nateng"".
- **Paragraph 21**: The example ""pi-nrite-vke-nani"" (he doing without fail) shows the use of double negation with the suffixes ""-nrite-"" and ""-vke-"".

These examples demonstrate that negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) is marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, confirming that standard negation can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuki,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuki can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the primary method for negation in Yuki is the suffixation of a negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb. This is demonstrated in examples (60) and (62), where the negative suffix -ṭan is attached to the verb to indicate negation. Additionally, Paragraph 1 mentions a negative verb ṭal-, which also suggests modification of the verb for negation, although its use is less common and not fully understood. Paragraph 3 further supports this by discussing the use of the negative -ṭan in forming negative questions and prohibitives, indicating that this suffix is a consistent method for marking negation in various contexts.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Pipil,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Pipil can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the relevant points:

- Paragraph 2 (4.5.2. Negative imperatives): This paragraph explicitly shows the use of the prefix ""te:"" (C) or ""ma:/maka"" (SD) combined with the imperative prefix ""xi-"" to form negative imperatives. For example, ""ma: x-u"" (SD) or ""te: xi-yu"" (C) for ""don't go!"" and ""te: xi-k-kwa-kan"" (C) for ""don't eat it (you pl.)!"" This demonstrates that negation can be marked by a prefix that attaches to the verb.

- Paragraph 3 (4.1. Word order): This paragraph mentions that verbs in Pipil bear pronominal affixes which cross-reference subjects and objects. While this does not directly address negation, it supports the idea that verbs in Pipil can be modified by affixes.

- Paragraph 12 (3.7. Verbs): This section outlines the structure of verbs in Pipil, including the use of various prefixes and suffixes. It indicates that verbs can be modified by affixes, which is consistent with the use of a negation prefix.

- Paragraph 16 (3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object'): This paragraph discusses the use of the prefix ""ta-"" to indicate an unspecified object, showing that verbs in Pipil can indeed be modified by prefixes.

The evidence from these paragraphs indicates that negation in Pipil can be marked by a prefix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Micmac,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Micmac can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide evidence for this:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the ""negative morpheme"" intervening between the ""Stem"" and ""Ending"" in certain forms, indicating that negation involves a morpheme that is integrated into the verb structure.
- **Paragraph 4** describes how in the negative form, ""g-insertion"" does not occur due to the presence of an ""intrusive"" element, suggesting a modification related to negation.
- **Paragraph 7** indicates that in the animate negative forms, there are segments (possibly morphemes) that appear after the theme, implying affixation.
- **Paragraph 10** states that the negative morpheme takes the shape ""n6"" in the inanimate, which is inserted by a rule, indicating an affix.
- **Paragraph 12** notes that verbs in the negative and future negative forms have endings that are formally identical to the simple negative endings, suggesting a systematic morphological marking of negation.
- **Paragraph 47** provides a detailed description of negative forms of intransitive verbs, showing that the negative morpheme ""-w-"" appears within the verb structure, following the number morpheme and preceding the person marker. This clearly indicates that negation is marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Micmac can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: The examples show the use of the temporal adverbial clitic +ka7 attached to the negative particle jaantu, forming jaantu+ka7. This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 3**: The negative particle jaantu is used to negate clauses, and it can occur at the beginning of the clause or immediately before the verb. Additionally, the particle can be truncated to tuu. The examples also show jaantu+ch, where +ch is a clitic attached to the negative particle. This demonstrates that negation can involve a clitic.

- **Paragraph 4**: The negative particle jaantu and its truncated form tuu are used to negate verbs. The particle can precede the verb, indicating a modification of the verb phrase for negation.

- **Paragraph 6**: The clitic +7as can attach to the negative particle jaantu, forming jaantu+7as, which is used for negative questions. This shows that negation can involve a clitic attached to the negative particle.

- **Paragraph 7**: The clitic +ka7 can attach to the negative particle tuu, forming tuu+ka7, indicating that negation can be marked by a clitic.

- **Paragraph 8**: Examples show the negative particle jaantu preceding verbs in various tenses and aspects, indicating that negation involves modification of the verb phrase.

- **Paragraph 9**: The negative particle jaantu precedes the verb or adverb, and can be combined with clitics like +ch, indicating that negation can involve clitics and modification of the verb phrase.

- **Paragraph 11**: The negative future prefix ti- combines with the irrealis prefix ka- and the negative particle jaantu to form negative future constructions, showing that negation can involve affixes and modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is evidence suggesting that standard negation in Musqueam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions ""Negative past habitual, 'never'"" with forms such as ""?ewe-2-4.4, ?ew-E2-4.4, ?eaw-e-4.4-2"" and ""negative past interrogative"" with forms like ""?ew-€-2-4.4."" These forms indicate that negation involves morphological changes to the verb, likely through affixation.

Additionally, Paragraph 3 provides an example of negation with the phrase ""He never‘Didn'tas in?ew&ex”1émex”?owfex” ¢*flemex”‘Willyousing?,heonlyever exampleis negative ‘willyou(Won'tgo?! you."" The presence of ""?ew"" in these examples further supports the use of a negative morpheme attached to the verb.

Therefore, the evidence points to the use of affixes or modifications of the verb to mark standard negation in Musqueam.

**Reasoning:**
1. Paragraph 1 explicitly mentions negative forms involving morphological changes to the verb.
2. Paragraph 3 provides examples of negation using forms that include a negative morpheme attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the evidence suggests that standard negation in Omaha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""the -e apparently stays -e before declarative bazhi,"" indicating that the verb form can change in the presence of a negating particle.
2. **Paragraph 7** states, ""In a command, a preceding -e verb ablauts to -a before the negating particle azhi,"" showing that the verb undergoes ablaut (a vowel change) when negated.
3. **Paragraph 17** reinforces this by stating, ""All versions of the negating particle allow a preceding -e verb to ablaut to -a when describing someone’s past action.""
4. **Paragraph 20** mentions, ""When azhi is used, it combines tightly with the preceding verb, so that shkāx̣ a azhi sounds like shkāx̣ azhi,"" indicating that the negating particle azhi becomes phonologically bound to the verb.
5. **Paragraph 24** states, ""To negate a verb, we add a negating particle after it. This particle is itself conjugated,"" which implies that the negating particle is closely associated with the verb.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that negation in Omaha involves modifications to the verb or the addition of phonologically bound particles (clitics or affixes).

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the method of standard negation in Washo definitively. The paragraphs are fragmented and lack clear examples or explanations of how negation is marked in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

However, Paragraph 28 mentions a ""Negative"" suffix ""-é°s"" in the context of verb stems, which suggests that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb. This is the only relevant information that directly points to a morphological marker for negation.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 28**: This paragraph provides an example of a negative suffix ""-é°s"" attached to a verb stem, indicating that negation in Washo can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Washo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Koasati,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Koasati can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide clear examples of negation being marked directly on the verb through affixes or clitics. For instance:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative particle ""inkg"" and its usage in sentences, which implies that negation can be marked by a particle.
- Paragraph 2 discusses the lack of certain verbal forms in a defective verb, including negative forms, indicating that negation is a morphological feature.
- Paragraph 5 provides examples of negative forms of verbs, showing that negation is marked by specific morphemes attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 8 explicitly states that the negative subject cross-reference markers are prefixed and that the negative complement ""-9"" is suffixed.
- Paragraph 9 discusses the negative morpheme ""ik...o"" and its usage in negative constructions, indicating a bound morpheme for negation.
- Paragraph 11 mentions the negative subject cross-reference marker and the negative complement in the context of class 2A verbs.
- Paragraph 14 highlights the negative subject cross-reference suffixes and their similarity to other classes, showing that negation is morphologically marked.
- Paragraph 23 provides examples of negative forms of verbs, such as ""bankin"" and ""kamnotikkg,"" demonstrating the use of negative morphemes.

These examples collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Koasati involves affixes or modifications directly on the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking negation through bound morphemes.

Conclusion: 1",1,1

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the negative prefix ""e-"" used in u clauses, translating to 'so that... not...'. This prefix is attached to verbs in these clauses.
2. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that ""Negation in Barbareno Chumash always appears in the form of the prefix -e-."" This prefix is seen in verbs, as illustrated in the example ""s-e-2u8""02-was"" ('[if] she hadn’t let (him)').
3. **Paragraph 8** lists ""Negative e-"" as one of the prefixes that can attach to verbs in Barbareño Chumash.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Barbareño Chumash can be marked by an affix (specifically, the prefix ""e-"") that attaches to verbs.

### Conclusion:
1. The standard negation in Barbareño Chumash is marked by an affix (the prefix ""e-"") that attaches to verbs.
2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuchi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by a pre-clitic that attaches to the verb. Specifically, the negative pre-clitic ""nP-"" (or its variants) is mentioned multiple times as attaching to the beginning of the verb phrase, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. This is evident in several paragraphs:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative pre-clitic ""nC-"" at the beginning of the verb phrase.
- **Paragraph 4** explicitly states that the negative pre-clitic ""nP-"" attaches to the beginning of either the noun or the verb phrase and is always attached, never an independent particle.
- **Paragraph 6** provides an example where the negative pre-clitic ""ne-"" is attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 9** mentions that negative warnings are formed with the negative pre-clitic on the verb.
- **Paragraph 11** describes the negative pre-clitic ""n2-"" used to express negative ability in the past.
- **Paragraph 14** discusses the attachment of the negative pre-clitic ""ni-"" to the verb or a noun.
- **Paragraph 16** states that Yuchi has two negative pre-clitics ""n2-"" and ""h&-"".
- **Paragraph 30** provides examples of negative commands where the negative pre-clitic is prominently stressed and attached to the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Yuchi can indeed be marked by a pre-clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the evidence suggests that standard negation in Alsea is marked by a particle that precedes the verb, rather than by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that pronouns are prefixed to the negative particle that must precede the verb.
2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that these elements are prefixed to the particle of negation.
3. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that the particle serves as a particle of negation.
4. **Paragraph 8** refers to a particle of negation and provides an example of its use.

These paragraphs consistently describe the use of a separate particle for negation, which precedes the verb. There is no mention of the negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification directly on the verb itself. Therefore, based on the given information, it is clear that negation is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Arikara,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Arikara can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 11 provides clear examples of negative patterns where the prefix ""kaakA-"" is used to negate verbs. For instance, ""kaakAtciikaahu’"" (do not drink), ""kaakAxciikadhu’"" (do not sing), and ""kaakAtwaaWlhtiiku’"" (do not talk) all show the use of the ""kaakA-"" prefix attached to the verb to indicate negation. This prefix is phonologically bound to the verb, thus meeting the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Takelma,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Takelma can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negation in Takelma. It mentions that an indicative non-future statement, such as one expressed by the aorist, is negated without changing the verb form by using the negative adverb ""ani."" However, for imperative or future forms, the non-aoristic negative adverb ""wede"" is prefixed to the verb. Examples include ""wede yana‘k‘"" (he will not go) and ""wede yana‘t' do not go!"" This indicates that ""wede"" is a negative particle that attaches to the verb, functioning similarly to a clitic or prefix.

- **Paragraph 3** further supports this by stating that ""wede"" is used with inferential and potential modes to form negative constructions, such as ""wede d6“ma’/'n"" (I SHOULD NOT HAVE KILLED HIM). This reinforces the idea that ""wede"" is phonologically bound to the verb, marking negation.

- **Paragraph 4** mentions that negative indefinites like ""nek’"" and ""k‘ai"" are preceded by the negative adverb ""ani"" or ""wede,"" depending on the tense-mode of the verb. This shows that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 7** discusses the etymology of ""wede"" and its use in negative constructions, suggesting that it functions as a bound element in forming negative sentences.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that negation in Takelma can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, such as the negative adverb ""wede.""

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Jemez,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, there are several pieces of evidence indicating that standard negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (266): ""mfsemq"" glossed as ""Don't get tainted."" Here, ""mfse-m@"" is glossed as ""tainted/inc-no/without,"" indicating the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.
   - Example (267): ""no vemq"" glossed as ""Don't think that way."" Here, ""v&m@"" is glossed as ""think/inc-no/without,"" again showing the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (276): ""hb$ m$nfmg"" glossed as ""Don't be slow."" Here, ""m$nf-m@"" is glossed as ""slow/inc-no/without,"" indicating the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.
   - Example (277): ""d$*ge S 6 m ~"" glossed as ""Don't live there."" Here, ""S6-rn@"" is glossed as ""live/stat-no/without,"" showing the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (190): ""tY8-semq"" glossed as ""Don't sit down."" Here, ""tY8*se-m@"" is glossed as ""sit/inc-no,"" indicating the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.
   - Example (191): ""khy$?n$kW& yomq"" glossed as ""Don't feed the dog."" Here, ""yo-m@"" is glossed as ""feed/inc-no,"" showing the use of the suffix ""-m@"" for negation.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - It mentions the negative prefix ""/W&/"" as part of the verb structure, indicating that negation can be marked by a prefix.

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example (20): ""He did not wake up."" Here, ""neg iben[3sg]-neg-reWpl-wake.up/pf"" indicates the use of a negative prefix.

From these examples, it is clear that Jemez uses suffixes like ""-m@"" and prefixes like ""/W&/"" to mark negation, which are phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Zuni,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Zuni can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions that a negative verb stem suffix is required to mark negation in the Zuni clause. Paragraph 4 provides an example where the suffix ""-k"" is present in the negative form of the eventive intransitive verb. Paragraph 6 further clarifies that the negative suffix occurs after transitive subject agreement but before tense inflection. Paragraph 10 gives an example of a verb with a negative suffix ""-nam"" in the sentence ""k¥a'‘okyaccik'te'le’k'oSo-nam-kya"" (the woman didn't wash the pot). Paragraph 31 also shows the use of the negative suffix ""-nam"" in the sentence ""k¥a'pimc'ananeg.piglet‘itok'ya-nam-kya"" (he didn't feed the piglet).

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Rama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions the use of the negative morpheme ""-tahma"" as a suffix in the verb form ""work-3-do-NEG-TNS"" (work-3-do-NEG-TNS ‘he never worked’). This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.
   - Paragraph 9 describes the negative imperative construction ""arka,"" which is a bi-morphemic form ""ar-ka,"" where ""ar"" is a negative morpheme. This suggests that negation can be marked by a clitic or affix attached to the verb in imperative constructions.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 16 discusses the negation particle ""aa"" which is prefixed to the verb, as in ""aa-alkws-i"" (NEG-speak-TNS ‘not speak’). This indicates that negation can be marked by modifying the verb with a prefix.

3. **Additional Evidence**:
   - Paragraph 49 provides examples of negation in subordinate clauses and with progressive aspect, showing both ""aa"" and ""taama"" used in conjunction with verbs. For instance, ""suuli-kaas aay-auk-baakur-ua"" (animal-meat NEG 3-roast-PROG-TNS ‘she was not roasting meat’) and ""suuli-kaas y-auk-bakit-taama"" (animal-meat 3-roast-PROG-NEG ‘she was not roasting meat’). This further supports the presence of negation markers that are affixed or bound to the verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Rama can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Tonkawa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tonkawa can be marked by an affix. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-abe-"" is used to form the negative of any verb by adding it directly to the theme. This is evident from multiple examples and explanations across the paragraphs.

For instance, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative suffix ""-abe-"" and provides examples such as ""yalxilna- to run away, plus the negative suffix -abe and the imperative suffix -u."" Paragraph 5 further elaborates on the negative suffix, stating, ""The negative of any verb may be formed by adding the suffix -abe- directly to the theme."" Examples provided include ""yagb-ab-o'c"" (I do not hit him) and ""geigab-ab-o'"" (he does not hit me).

Additionally, Paragraph 2 outlines the position of the negative suffix within the verb form, indicating that it is a consistent and integral part of the verb morphology in Tonkawa.

Therefore, it is evident that standard negation in Tonkawa can indeed be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tunica,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, it is evident that standard negation in the language can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. Several examples and explanations support this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the construction of negative forms of active verbs using elements like ""-aha"" and ""-k?aha"".
- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negative postfixes such as ""-aha"" and ""-k?aha"" used with verbs to form negative paradigms.
- **Paragraph 5** gives examples of verbs with negative postfixes like ""-aha"" and ""-k?aha"" attached to them.
- **Paragraph 8** explicitly shows the formation of negative forms by adding ""-aha"" and ""-k?aha"" to verbs, e.g., ""lo’tawik?aha"" (he does not run) and ""tilo’t?utak?aha"" (he does not make her run).

These examples clearly demonstrate that negation in Tunica can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Wappo. The most relevant information is found in Paragraph 4, which discusses the formation of the negative in Wappo.

#### Key Points from Paragraph 4:
- **Negation is formed by the postposition of ""la'ki""**: This is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix of unknown force.
- **Effect on the preceding verb-stem**: ""la'ki"" has the same effect on the preceding verb-stem as the subordinating suffixes ""-tsel,"" ""-kwen,"" and frequently causes them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes.
- **""la"" as a suffix or postposition**: ""la"" has been secondarily specialized into a suffix or postposition with the meaning of ""without.""

From this information, we can infer that the standard negation in Wappo involves a postposition ""la'ki"" that affects the verb-stem. Specifically, it causes the verb-stem to lose the vowel of its tense-aspect suffixes, indicating a modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. **Reasoning**: The standard negation in Wappo can be marked by a modification of the verb, as evidenced by the effect of ""la'ki"" on the preceding verb-stem, causing it to lose the vowel of its tense-aspect suffixes.
2. **Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Ute,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ute can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

2. The paragraphs provide multiple examples of negative suffixes and modifications directly attached to verbs. For instance, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative suffix -n a'ai- used with verbs of sight and its participialized form -n a'ait i-. It also discusses the negative verbalizing -ai- appearing as -a-, -a'- before subordinating -qu-. Paragraph 2 further supports this by explaining that verbs can take a negative suffix or undergo a negative modification of a verbalizing suffix, with examples such as -ywa'ai- functioning as a negative present and -ywa'ai- replacing -kai- in subordinating forms.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yurok,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yurok can be marked by a preverb that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the preverb ""neemee"" is used to negate verbs in various contexts, as seen in multiple examples:

- Paragraph 1 mentions ""the ordinary negative preverb neemee"" which occurs before the verb.
- Paragraph 4 provides examples of ""neemee wo"" used to negate verbs in past-time contexts.
- Paragraph 7 shows ""neemee"" used in the context of negating dynamic verbal predicates.
- Paragraph 16 further illustrates the use of ""neemee"" as the default negative marker in various sentences.

These examples demonstrate that ""neemee"" is a preverb that attaches to the verb to indicate negation, fulfilling the criteria for being an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nuuchahnulth,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 2 (example 248d): The sentence ""vhJ`QpTr"" (vhj<""`Q<pt9<r) shows the use of the negation root ""vhj"" followed by tense and mood markers. This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that attaches to the verb, as ""vhj"" is a negative root that combines with other clitics to form the negative construction.

- Paragraph 4 (example 209a-c): The examples show the use of ""vhjH"" (not) combined with indicative clitics and verbs. This demonstrates that negation involves a clitic that attaches to the verb, forming a negative construction.

- Paragraph 6 (example 490b): The sentence ""vhjG@r"" (vhj<G@<r) shows the use of the negation root ""vhj"" combined with interrogative and indicative clitics. This further supports the idea that negation is marked by a clitic that attaches to the verb.

These examples collectively indicate that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth involves the use of a negative root or clitic that attaches to the verb, forming a phonologically bound construction.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Columbia-Wenatchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin) as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Describes Pattern A negation, which involves a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause. The example given is:
   - `lat—_—Pis?itn ?in-s-?itn` (NEG __ 1sPS-NM-eat) ""I didn’t eat.""
   This indicates the use of a negative particle (`lat`) and nominalization of the verb.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that negation involves the particle `lut` and a predicate marked for irrealis mode. This suggests that the verb can be marked for irrealis in negation contexts.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Describes Pattern C negation, which involves the negation particle `lut` followed by an unmarked indicative clause. This indicates the use of a negative particle without modifying the verb.

4. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of prohibitives that follow Pattern C negation, showing the use of the negative particle `lit` with irrealis marking on the verb:
   - `litkasxdq’ncx” kas-xaq’-nt-sa-x”` (NEG IR-pay-TR-1so-2ss) ""do not pay me!""
   - `litkasxdsntx” kas-xos-nt-x”` (NEG IR-Jose-TR-(3AB)-2sS) ""Don’t lose your watch!""
   This shows that the verb can be marked for irrealis in prohibitive contexts.

5. **Paragraph 23**: States that negation can trigger nominalization of the negated predicate, reinforcing the information from Paragraph 2.

From these paragraphs, we see that standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi involves:
- The use of a negative particle (`lat` or `lut`).
- The possibility of nominalizing the verb or marking it for irrealis mode.

Both nominalization and irrealis marking involve modifications to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Hidatsa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Hidatsa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -dhaa is used to indicate clausal negation and is attached directly to the predicate head, as illustrated in examples (266)–(270) and other instances throughout the text.

For instance:
- In paragraph 4, example (266): ""Macéédhaac."" (macéé-dhaa-c) translates to ""He is not a man.""
- In paragraph 4, example (267): ""Maaˀiiˀúùdi madú wareeg, úˀsiadhaac."" (maaˀiiˀúùdi madú waree-g úˀsia-dhaa-c) translates to ""Something must have happened, he hasn’t arrived.""

These examples clearly show that the negative suffix -dhaa is an affix that attaches to the verb to indicate negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Toqabaqita,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Toqabaqita can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several instances:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative verb ""aqi"" which means 'not be so, not be the case' and is used with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker, forming one phonological word.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of the negative construction ""qe=aqi"" (3SG.NFUT=NEGV) used in responses to questions, indicating that negation can be marked by a clitic.
- Paragraph 5 discusses the use of negative subject markers and the negative verb ""aqi"" in various negative constructions, including simple and double negative constructions.
- Paragraph 6 further elaborates on the simple negative construction using negative subject markers and the double negative construction involving the negative verb ""aqi"" with a subject marker.

These examples demonstrate that Toqabaqita employs both affixes/clitics and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Aghu,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Aghu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence supporting this conclusion includes the following points:

- Paragraph 2 describes the use of negated finite future forms, where negation is marked by the clitic ""=de"" attached to the verb (e.g., ""ade-Ø=dè xo"").
- Paragraph 5 provides examples of negation in present and past events using the clitic ""=de"" (e.g., ""joxodebaxe-n=dexo"" meaning 'they are not here').
- Paragraph 7 further confirms the use of the clitic ""=de"" in negated realis verbs (e.g., ""da-de=dè xo"" meaning 'I come' negated).
- Paragraph 11 illustrates the use of the clitic ""=de"" in negated future forms (e.g., ""axi=dexo"" meaning 'I will not go').

These examples demonstrate that negation in Aghu involves a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Manambu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Manambu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 1 (14.1.1 Negation of verbal predicates) explicitly mentions that the general negator ""ma:"" negates a verbal predicate of a declarative non-habitual clause. It also describes how verbs undergo vowel changes when negated, indicating a modification of the verb. For example, ""gra-"" (cry) becomes ""ma: ga:r"" (does not/did not cry), and ""kur-"" (do/get) becomes ""ma: kwa:r"" (does not/did not do/get). This shows that negation involves modifying the verb form.
- Paragraph 2 (14.5.2 Negating questions) discusses the use of the dependent negator ""-ma:r-"" in questions, which is an affix attached to the verb. For example, ""yi-ma:r-na-d"" (go-neg.sub-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt) in a negative content question.
- Paragraph 3 (14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negation) further supports the use of ""ma:"" as a negator that precedes the verb, indicating a modification of the verb form. It also mentions that the negator and the verb form one phonological word in future negative constructions.
- Paragraph 4 (14.3.2 Negation of same-subject purposive and of desiderative) mentions the use of the negator ""ata"" as a particle that precedes the verb in negating same-subject purposive and desiderative forms. Although ""ata"" forms an independent phonological word, it shows that negation can involve elements closely associated with the verb.
- Paragraph 5 (14.3.1 Negation of irrealis and optative) describes the use of ""ak@s"" as a negator for irrealis and optative forms, which is followed by a fully inflected verb. This indicates a specific negation strategy involving a negator and verb modification.
- Paragraph 6 (14.5 Negation of dependent clauses, questions, and focus structures) discusses the use of ""-ma:r-"" as a dependent clause negator, which is an affix attached to the verb. For example, ""kur-ma:r-"" (do/get-neg.sub) and ""ka:l-ma:r-"" (dry-neg.sub).

These examples demonstrate that standard negation in Manambu can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Momu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Momu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative particle ""momu"" can attach to the verb as a clitic, as seen in examples like ""netyi=momu"" (throw.one[1|3sgS]=neg) and ""ai-kuw=momu"" (impf-consume\3sgS=neg). These examples demonstrate that negation can be phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Makasae by examining the evidence for the use of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions a ""negative prefix ni-"" and a ""negation nomo."" The prefix ""ni-"" is explicitly described as a verbal prefix, which negates the meaning of the verb it is used with. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of the negative prefix ""ni-"" in use, further confirming that this prefix attaches to verbs to indicate negation.

3. **Paragraph 1** discusses the use of ""nomo"" for negation, but it is described as a free particle rather than an affix or clitic. However, the presence of the negative prefix ""ni-"" is sufficient to establish that negation can be marked by an affix.

4. **Paragraph 24** states that ""nomo"" is not phonetically dependent on either a preceding or a following item, confirming it as a free particle. This does not contradict the use of ""ni-"" as an affix.

5. **Paragraph 27** and **Paragraph 29** discuss the scope and placement of negation within the clause, indicating that ""nomo"" is used within the VP but does not negate the possibility of ""ni-"" being used as a prefix.

6. **Paragraph 10** mentions that negative verbs are not compatible with the internal negator ""nomo,"" but this does not affect the use of ""ni-"" as a prefix.

Given the evidence from these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Makasae can indeed be marked by an affix (the prefix ""ni-"") that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of negation in Motuna. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation with Particles**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative particle ""toku"" and the numeral ""noi"" in negative sentences. It states that the presence of the Perfect form of the verb ""tu(h)-"" is optional in such sentences.
   - Paragraph 2 provides examples of negative sentences using ""toku"" and ""noi"" before verbs, such as ""tokunoingo-i-heeta-na"" (you will not do any big work) and ""noiku 'k-a-ki-ng"" (people did not dig).
   - Paragraph 6 also discusses the use of ""toku"" as a negator for adjectives and adverbs, and its combination with ""noi"" for total negation.

2. **Affixes and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 3 introduces the Negative Optative suffix ""/-raa/"" used in verbal clauses, indicating that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that the negative particle ""toku"" cannot intervene between aspectual verbs and preceding medial verbs, suggesting that negation can be marked within the verb complex.

3. **Verb Modification**:
   - Paragraph 8 discusses the use of the negative infix ""/-woo-/"" in combination with TAM suffixes and gender or switch-reference markings, indicating that negation can be marked by modifying the verb.

From these points, it is evident that negation in Motuna can be marked by an affix (e.g., the Negative Optative suffix ""/-raa/""), a clitic (e.g., the negative infix ""/-woo-/""), or by modifying the verb. This aligns with the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates.

### Conclusion:
1",0,1
Lavukaleve,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Lavukaleve can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the verbal suffix -la is used to negate verbs, as detailed in Paragraph 2. This suffix is a clear example of an affix that attaches to the verb to indicate negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Dla (Menggwa),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

- **Affixation**: Paragraph 1 mentions that negative irrealis is conveyed by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m. Paragraph 6 further elaborates that negative irrealis verbs differ from positive irrealis verbs by having an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem.
- **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 7 provides examples of negative realis forms where the verb is modified with the negative realis verb boke or boka. For instance, ""wamlaaflambli seru boke-aha-hwa"" (I did not chew a lot of betel nut) and ""wamlaaflambli ma-ser-iha-hwa"" (I did not chew a lot of betel nut) show how the verb is modified to indicate negation.
- **Clitics**: Paragraph 2 mentions the use of the negative semi-realis particle ga, which is a separate phonological word but is used in conjunction with the verb to indicate negation.

These examples demonstrate that Dla (Menggwa) employs affixes, clitics, and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

2. **Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Duna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Duna can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to express negation on verbal predicates. This circumfix is applied to the verb root, forming a derived negative stem that can function as the predicate of a final clause. Examples from the text include:

- ""na-ra-ya"" (NEG-be/sit-NEG) in ""This one does not exist on our land.""
- ""na-ke-ya-o"" (NEG-see-NEG-PFV) in ""I didn’t see.""
- ""na-na-ya-na"" (NEG-eat-NEG-HAB) in ""I don’t eat snake.""

These examples demonstrate that the negation is marked directly on the verb through the use of the circumfix.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Taulil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taulil, it is evident that standard negation in Taulil can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

2. The reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:

- Paragraph 2 (3.7. NEGATION): It mentions that the negator ""kori"" is used for clausal negation, usually in verbal clauses. This indicates that negation can be directly associated with the verb.
- Paragraph 3 (3.7. NEGATION): Provides examples of negation in verbal clauses using ""kori"" before the verb, such as in (177a) ""kori tə-t∼təm =a pern =a ləmat"" (‘they didn’t know (how to) climb for coconut’).
- Paragraph 14 (3.1. INTRODUCTION): Discusses that verbal predicates in transitive and intransitive clauses are negated by the negator ""kori"" immediately before the verb complex.
- Paragraph 18 (3.7.1 Negation with kori only): Shows examples of negation in verbal clauses using ""kori"" before the verb, confirming that negation is marked directly on the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Taulil involves the use of ""kori"" directly before the verb, indicating that negation is marked by an element that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Taiap,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in the language Taiap can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the negation of verbs using the negator ""wákare."" Examples show that the verb stem in negation is marked with irrealis suffixes such as -kɨ, -ki, or -ku, which are affixed to the verb stem. For instance, ""okɨ wákare"" (go.irr-irr neg) means 'didn't go' or 'won't go,' where ""okɨ"" is the verb stem with the irrealis suffix -kɨ.

- **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of negation in both transitive and intransitive verbs, showing the use of the negator ""wákare"" and the irrealis suffixes. For example, ""a-kru wákare"" (consume.irr-3sg.f.irr.o neg) means 'didn't eat' or 'won't eat,' where ""a-kru"" is the verb stem with the irrealis suffix -kru.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Yimas,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yimas can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Only verbs can be inflected with the negative morpheme; there are no negative forms for the true adjectives, such as kpa- 'big'."" This indicates that negation is applied directly to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples of negative verbs with the prefix ta- (e.g., ""ta-nan-i-c-IJkan-mpan-mpwi"" meaning 'You few didn't tell them'). This shows that negation is marked by a prefix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 6 explains that the negative prefix ta- usurps the position of the lowest ranked participant, which is then expressed as a suffix following the tense suffix. This further confirms that negation is marked by modifying the verb with a prefix and rearranging the morphology.
- Paragraph 7 discusses the behavior of serial verb constructions under negation, where the negative prefix ta- applies to the entire verb sequence, indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine definitively if standard negation in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs do not provide explicit examples or descriptions of negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. The information given is more focused on other grammatical aspects such as relative clauses, information structure, and nominal syntax.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Maybrat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Maybrat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion comes from the description of the negators ""fe"" and ""m-fe"" in the text.

Paragraph 1 (from the descriptive grammar) explains that there are two ways to express negation in Maybrat: with the clausal negator ""fe"" and its predicative counterpart ""m-fe"". The predicative form ""m-fe"" is particularly relevant because it functions as a verb and takes a third person unmarked person prefix, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. This is evident from examples like:

(166) arko m-fe, y-o ita m-ata
firewood 3U-NEG 3M-take leaf leaf
‘There is no firewood, he takes leafs.’

Additionally, Paragraph 5 reinforces this by showing that ""m-fe"" can negate an NP and is more commonly used as a nominal negator than a clausal negator. This indicates that ""m-fe"" is an affix that attaches to verbs or nouns to express negation.

Therefore, the presence of ""m-fe"" as a bound morpheme that attaches to verbs confirms that standard negation in Maybrat can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Asmat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Asmat language, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Asmat. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the negation forms ""pok"" and ""emdr"" linked with the m-/mV- forms of the verb. For example, ""manapor PZnakdw"" (why won't you eat them!) and ""j6mupupok"" (don't let the sun rise).

2. **Paragraph 3** states that ""pak"" is used for negation and is linked with specific forms of the verb, indicating that ""pak"" can be used in negative constructions.

3. **Paragraph 6** elaborates that only specific forms of the verb (m-/mV- and m-/mV-@) can precede negations like ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"". Examples include ""m@or pdk embf"" (I did not see it) and ""Sujit masetdj powdSajit has not arrived"".

4. **Paragraph 11** confirms that only forms of categories 4 and 5 (m-/mV-; m-/mV- -diji) can form word-groups with negations.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Asmat involves specific forms of the verb (m-/mV- forms) and negation markers such as ""pak"" and ""pok"". These negation markers are phonologically bound to the verb forms, either as prefixes or suffixes.

### Conclusion: 1

Standard negation in the language Asmat can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",0,1
Kuot,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kuot is not marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, negation is primarily achieved through the use of particles that precede the verb or the negated constituent. The main negators mentioned are **tǝle** and its variant **tǝla** for future contexts, and **mani** in some dialects. These negators are not affixed or cliticized to the verb but are separate particles. Additionally, the prohibitive marker **buat** and the negative existential **karuk** are also particles. 

The paragraphs provide clear examples of these particles in use, such as:
- **tǝle=kan [u-me ubi]** (NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø) ‘He didn’t use to work’
- **tǝlekakarat, kakkaliat=arokan.** (NEG near far=a.little(.more)) ‘it wasn’t near, it was rather far.’
- **mani u-la=kan u-onǝma** (what 3mS-go=EMPH 3mS-sit) ‘he didn’t go and sit down’
- **Karuk=kan ma lop tiro** (is.not=EMPH 3p.PossI child.nsg here) ‘There are no children here’

These examples consistently show that the negation is marked by separate particles rather than affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Imonda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Imonda can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs describe the use of the negative suffix ""-rn"" and its fuller form ""-me"" in various contexts, including declarative sentences with dynamic verbal predicates. For instance, Paragraph 3 mentions the use of ""-m"" in negative constructions, and Paragraph 22 elaborates on the discontinuous negation marker ""sg...-me"" for verbal predicates. Additionally, Paragraph 23 discusses the use of ""-m"" as both a negation and interrogative marker, further supporting the presence of phonologically bound negation markers in the language.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no direct information about the method of standard negation in Nimboran. The paragraphs mostly discuss phonological and morphological aspects of the language, such as consonant sequences, vowel phonemes, morphological categories, and examples of verb forms. However, none of the paragraphs explicitly describe how negation is marked in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

1. **Reasoning**: The given paragraphs do not provide any explicit information about the method of standard negation in Nimboran. They focus on phonological rules, morphological categories, and verb forms but do not address how negation is expressed in the language.

2. **Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Abun,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abun is primarily marked by the use of two negative particles, ""yo"" and ""nde,"" which bracket the predicate. This bracketing method is consistent and invariant, as described in multiple paragraphs.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""yo"" always precedes the predicate, and ""nde"" always follows the predicate, illustrating the use of these particles in negating sentences.
2. **Paragraph 3** reinforces this by stating that the two particles, ""yo"" and ""nde,"" bracket the predicate to negate Abun sentences.
3. **Paragraph 6** further explains that the scope of negation is determined by the use of these linked particles, which always and only bracket the predicate.
4. **Paragraph 17** provides an example where the predicate is bracketed by ""yo"" and ""nde,"" showing the rigid word order in negation.
5. **Paragraph 26** explicitly states that the main NEG-marker, ""nde,"" is not attached to the verb and is frequently distant from the verb, indicating that negation is not marked by an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

Given this consistent description, it is clear that standard negation in Abun is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, it is marked by the use of separate negative particles that bracket the predicate.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Meryam Mir,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, it is evident that standard negation in the language can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1 (5.6 Negation)**: The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" precedes the verb to negate an event. Examples (5.77) to (5.80) show that the negation particle is used before the verb to indicate negation. However, this particle is not phonologically bound to the verb; it is a separate word.

- **Paragraph 1 (5.5.2 Imperatives)**: When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form with the privative suffix ""-kak"". Example (5.74) shows ""nole aro-kak"" where ""aro"" (eat) is nominalized and suffixed with ""-kak"" to indicate ""don't eat it"". This indicates that negation can involve a suffix attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 3 (2.114)**: This example reiterates the use of the privative suffix ""-kak"" in negative imperatives, confirming that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 6 (5.6 Negation)**: The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" must precede the verb, and it typically occurs following the first accented element in the utterance to negate an event. Examples (5.77) to (5.80) again show the use of the negation particle preceding the verb.

- **Paragraph 7 (2.251)**: This example shows the use of ""nole"" with a verb, indicating negation. However, it does not provide additional information about affixes or clitics.

From the above paragraphs, it is clear that while the negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" is used as a separate word, the privative suffix ""-kak"" is attached to the verb in negative imperatives, indicating that negation can indeed be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Hatam,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Hatam is marked by the negative adverb ""big,"" which is always in clause-final position. There is no evidence in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples consistently show ""big"" as a separate word at the end of the clause, not as a bound morpheme or a modification of the verb.

For instance:
- Paragraph 1: ""I didn't see (that) the pig ate my sweet potatoes."" (big is clause-final)
- Paragraph 3: ""Those children are not crying (because) they are hungry."" (big is clause-final)
- Paragraph 4: ""You didn't bring a bird, did you?"" (big is clause-final)
- Paragraph 10: ""I didn't strike the pig dead."" (big is clause-final)

These examples demonstrate that negation is expressed through the use of the word ""big"" placed at the end of the clause, rather than through any modification of the verb or the use of affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Kwomtari,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kwomtari can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix -i is used to mark negation on the verb, as seen in the examples provided.

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the clause final negative suffix -i in conjunction with the adverb glei ‘not’ to negate the predicate. For instance, in example (34), the verb is negated with the suffix -i: ""feta-ne-a-ne-i"" (see-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NEG), which translates to ‘The people didn’t used to come to Peter and look.’
- Paragraph 7 further clarifies that if the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being preceded by glei. This is illustrated in example (24): ""feta-ne-a-ne-i"" (see-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NEG), which translates to ‘The people did not habitually come and look at Peter.’
- Paragraph 12 also discusses the use of -i as a negated clause marker, as seen in example (105): ""Mena-nu mie glei fo-la-ne-i"" (1.PN-NN sago NEG eat-P.DUR-1/3P.R-NEG), which translates to ‘They (pigs) aren’t eating my sago.’

These examples demonstrate that the negation in Kwomtari involves a modification of the verb through the addition of the suffix -i.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Inanwatan,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - The negative suffix `-aigo` is used to mark negation on verbs.
   - Example: `(Nawo) n e-se-s-aigo` (I am not going to walk).
   - This shows that the verb `walk` is negated by the suffix `-aigo`.

2. **Paragraph 3**: 
   - The negative suffix `-aigo` is mentioned again, indicating its use in negating verbs.
   - Example: `(-sa+-lligo>-.I'aigo)` shows the suffix `-aigo` being used after the future suffix `-sa`.

3. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The verb form `-eri-aigo` is used in negative attributive-equative clauses.
   - Example: `sowato-eri-aigo` (we are not good).
   - This indicates that `-aigo` is used as a suffix to negate verbs.

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Verbs in Inanwatan are inflected for various grammatical categories, including negation.
   - This implies that negation is an integral part of the verb morphology.

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - The negative suffix `-aigo` is mentioned as part of the verb inflection system.

### Conclusion: 1

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Therefore, the correct option is 1.",1,1
Iau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Iau can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 states that negatives in Iau are marked by the particles 'ae' or 'ai', which immediately follow the verb or the verb and the clitic stative particle if present. This indicates that the negation is closely tied to the verb, either as an affix or a clitic. Additionally, the examples provided in Paragraph 5 show the negative particles directly following the verb, confirming that negation is marked in a way that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Karkar-Yuri,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Karkar-Yuri can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. This conclusion is drawn from the following evidence:

- Paragraph 3 mentions ""PASnot Ssf"" which suggests the presence of a negation marker ""PAS"" that could potentially be an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 17 includes the phrase ""9im-inter9not?!"" which indicates the use of a negation marker ""9not"" in a verbal context.
- Paragraph 37 describes a construction involving negation with the example ""ne'naiPreviousoporunmizeCbonor{0—-esuffixsuffix=nizoitsc-noi-mot.on-seq-—cschildren,inneswasnotthere.!-ennelnaikertérdép-an,"". This suggests the use of a suffix for negation.

These instances indicate that negation in Karkar-Yuri can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, such as affixes or clitics.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yelî Dnye,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Yelî Dnye can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4**: The example ""Ngem Kaawa NEG-D-FUT go.PCT IT.PLPRX . DU . S B."" shows the use of ""NEG-D-FUT"" as a prefix to indicate negation in a future tense verb form. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 5**: It mentions that the negative ""daa"" has different surface forms depending on its environment, suggesting that ""daa"" is a morpheme that can attach to verbs in various forms to indicate negation.

3. **Paragraph 15**: It states that ""The basic form used in negation is daa 'not'."" This indicates that ""daa"" is a standard negation marker, which can be used as an affix or clitic in the verb phrase.

4. **Paragraph 20**: It lists ""daa"" under the factors affecting the predicate, indicating that negation is one of the elements that can be incorporated into the verb structure.

5. **Paragraph 34**: The example ""Mepe didn' t c u t its throat, so it is still there at Doonge."" shows the use of negation in a verb phrase, implying that negation is integrated into the verb structure.

These examples collectively demonstrate that negation in Yelî Dnye can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Sentani,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Sentani can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG attaches directly to the verb root to negate the verb itself. This is evident from the description in Paragraph 1, which states that the negative circumfix only negates the verb rather than having scope over the entire sentence. Additionally, Paragraph 3 confirms that the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG is part of the PRE category that attaches to the front of the verb root.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mpur,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Mpur is marked by the adverb ""jan,"" which always occurs clause-finally. This is shown in multiple examples, such as:

- Paragraph 2: ""De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem."" (They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.)
- Paragraph 4: ""De-unot Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem jan."" (They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.)
- Paragraph 5: ""Iwma-n-kakokor jan."" (This bird is not a chicken.)
- Paragraph 29: ""In-unot jan Amanda-n."" (I don't know whether Amanda is tired.)

These examples consistently show that the negation is achieved by placing the adverb ""jan"" at the end of the clause, rather than by modifying the verb or using an affix/clitic bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that negation in Mpur is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, it is marked by a separate word (the adverb ""jan"") that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Mehek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mehek can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix -nak is used to negate verbs, as seen in multiple examples. For instance, in Paragraph 1, it is mentioned that ""a suffix -nak on the verb"" can be used for negation. Paragraph 6 further elaborates that ""One of the ways of expressing negation is by adding a suffix -nak to the verb."" Additionally, Paragraph 8 provides an example where the suffix -nak attaches directly to the verb stem: ""The suffix -nak attaches directly to the verb stem.""

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Abui,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abui can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in the following points:

- Paragraph 3 states that ""Abui clause is negated with the verb naha ‘not be’."" This verb follows the negated VP and is glossed as NEG. Examples (210a) and (210b) show the negator naha following the verbs nee ‘eat’ and tukoi ‘be strong’, respectively, to negate the whole clause.
- Paragraph 4 further illustrates that the verb naha can be used in negative clauses and can combine with other verbs in serial verb constructions, indicating that it functions as a negator in various contexts.
- Paragraph 6 mentions that ""Negator (NEG), prohibitive particles, affirmative predicate markers (APM), and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) are found in the right edge or right periphery of the clause,"" reinforcing the role of naha as a negator in the clause structure.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Abui involves the use of the verb naha, which can be considered a modification of the verb phrase to express negation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the prohibitive mood in Abu', which involves the use of the negative verbal lexeme ""ko'isi"" meaning 'don't'. The example given is:
   - ""ko'isi' ! ! NEG !!"" indicating that ""ko'isi"" is a negative marker that can be used with verb forms.
   
2. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph states that two forms are used by Abu' speakers to express negation: ""uwa'"" meaning 'not' and ""duwa'"" meaning 'nothing'. While it does not explicitly state that these are affixes or clitics, it suggests that these forms are used in negation.

3. **Paragraph 31**: This paragraph provides an example of negation with the verb:
   - ""25. «kk-u -k -a -ha -' -u -k -a -' 3SGEA -IR-N0NPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU 'She did not hit her.' ‘She uwa' not not""
   - ""26. alemam mm -a -fan duwa' duwa' men 3PLMA-R-j3’ -sit nothing 'The men sat doing nothing.' ‘The men sat doing nothing.’""
   This shows that ""uwa'"" and ""duwa'"" are used in conjunction with verbs to express negation.

4. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph describes the structure of sentences expressing negation:
   - ""Sentences must expressing These occur in utterance-negation are therefore of the following structure: -- > SS ++ NEG. of structure: NEG(s) ---> NEG.""
   This indicates that negation is marked within the sentence structure, likely involving the verb.

5. **Paragraph 32**: This paragraph provides further examples of negation involving verbs:
   - ""27. k¥-a-ha nubat 3SGFA -R-hit/kill dog 'She hit/killed a dog.' opposed to an intransitive""
   - ""28. kw -a'is 3SGFA-R-sleep 'She slept.'""
   - ""29. Pater -a -he’ kani aulaf f -a -f -i priest 3SGMA-R-£-go PREP house NCE (house)-DEM-NCE (house)-dd 'The priest went to the house.'""
   These examples show the use of verbal affixes in different contexts, suggesting that negation could similarly involve affixes or modifications to the verb.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korafe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the negative focus marker ""jo"" and the negative deverbal ""ae"" to signal negation. Specifically, it states: ""predications that are statements (4.90) and questions (4.91) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae 'not do' at the terminus.""
   - Paragraph 5 further elaborates on this by providing an example: ""Na jo ning-ae=ri."" (I didn't hear (what was said)). Here, ""jo"" is used as a negative focus marker, and ""ae"" is used as a negative deverbal affix attached to the verb stem.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 9 discusses the obligatory extension of the scope of negation over verbs within standardized clause sequences, using the morphemes ""jo ... ae"" to bracket the verbs. This indicates that the verb forms are modified to express negation.
   - Paragraph 28 describes the negative deverbal ""-ae"" as a derivational formative that combines with the verb stem to form negative constructions, further supporting the modification of the verb for negation.

3. **Examples of Negation**:
   - Multiple examples throughout the paragraphs illustrate the use of ""jo"" and ""ae"" in negating verbs. For instance, in Paragraph 3: ""Nu nu karnbo=da a-ira, avata vikoko jQ b-ae=ri."" (It is true that he went to the house, but he didn't get the knife). Here, ""jo"" precedes the verb to indicate negation, and ""ae"" is attached to the verb stem.

### Conclusion:
1

The evidence from the paragraphs clearly shows that standard negation in Korafe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Alamblak. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions negation particles such as ""f i nj i,"" ""a fe,"" and ""taf i te,"" which are used to mark negation in various contexts. These particles are separate words and not affixes or clitics bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 5** provides an example of a negative hortative construction: ""a - yay - wah - r"" (HORT-eat-IRR-3SM), which translates to ""What should the child not eat?"" This example does not clearly indicate the use of an affix or clitic for negation on the verb itself.

3. **Paragraph 13** discusses the negative hortative verb form and mentions that the hortative present tense form of the verb exhibits a morphological negative form with the possible exception of the form of the declarative present verb with ""-kah."" This suggests that there might be a morphological modification of the verb to indicate negation in some contexts.

4. **Paragraph 41** provides an example sentence with the negative particle ""f i nj i"" used to negate the verb phrase. The sentence ""r i tmf i nj i i n s e c t s NE Gtandh i - ak - n i -r- me - t - mr o a s t - ge t - g o - IRR-R . PS T- 3 S F - 3 P L"" translates to ""She did not roast (and) get the insects (and) go."" This again indicates the use of a separate negation particle rather than an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

From the information provided, it appears that negation in Alamblak is primarily marked by separate negation particles rather than affixes or clitics bound to the verb. However, there is a mention of a possible morphological negative form in the hortative present tense verb, which suggests that in some specific contexts, negation might be marked by a modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The primary method of negation appears to be through separate negation particles.
- There is a mention of a morphological negative form in the hortative present tense, indicating that in some contexts, negation might be marked by a modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
I'saka,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in I'saka is marked by the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears at the end of the clause. This particle is not phonologically bound to the verb, as it can follow other elements in the clause, such as oblique nominals or postverbal elements. There is no indication from the given paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

For example:
- Paragraph 2 states: ""Negation is expressed on all clauses, with verbal, adjectival or nominal predicates, with the negative particle mi, which appears clause-finally.""
- Paragraph 6 confirms: ""Negation can be marked only once for the clause, and it is always at the end of the clause, following both the predicate and any oblique nominals that are in clause-final position.""

These descriptions indicate that the negation marker ""mi"" is a separate word (particle) that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Urim,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Urim can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate that the verbal negator ""ake"" is used to negate verbal clauses and can occur immediately before or after the subject, or between the subject and the verb if the subject is fronted. This negator is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in examples like ""Ake kil atning"" (NEG 3sg listen.R) meaning ""He did not listen"" and ""Tu ake kai anong"" (3pl NEG go village) meaning ""They did not go to the village/home.""

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Abau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Abau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate the use of clause-final negation markers such as ""pey"" for imperfective aspect and ""pa"" for perfective aspect, which are phonologically bound to the verb phrase. Additionally, the use of the speech utterance marker ""o"" for emphatic negation also suggests a modification of the verb phrase.

For instance, Paragraph 5 (7.3.1 Negating verbal clauses) clearly states that the negation markers ""pey"" and ""pa"" occur clause-finally, directly following the verb phrase, indicating that they are phonologically bound to the verb. Paragraph 10 (7.4.2 Usage of imperfective speech marker o) further supports this by describing the use of the speech marker ""o"" in marking emphatic negation, which is also phonologically bound to the verb phrase.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Chamorro,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Chamorro can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that Chamorro has three ways of expressing sentence negation: with the sentential negative ""ti,"" with a negative verb, or with a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. This indicates that negation can be expressed through elements that are closely associated with the verb.

- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences where the sentential negative ""ti"" is used. The examples show ""ti"" preceding the verb, which suggests that ""ti"" is a clitic that attaches to the verb phrase, marking negation.

- **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of negative verbs (e.g., ""tai"" for 'not have', ""taigui"" for 'not be at a location', ""tåya’"" for 'not exist'). These negative verbs inherently carry negation, indicating that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb itself.

- **Paragraph 7** provides further examples of sentences with the sentential negative ""ti"" and negative verbs, reinforcing the idea that negation can be marked by elements closely associated with the verb.

- **Paragraph 24** reiterates that negative sentences in Chamorro can be formed with the sentential negative ""ti,"" a negative verb, or a syntactically focused negative indefinite. This confirms that negation can be marked by modifications or elements bound to the verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Chamorro can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Awtuw,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Awtuw can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 6 provide explicit evidence for this. Paragraph 2 mentions the use of the negative prefix ""ka-"" or ""ki-"" which can fill the first slot in the verb complex to negate any verbal predicate. Paragraph 6 further illustrates this with examples such as ""Awtiy k�-w-�y-re"" (Awtiy isn't going) and ""Awtiy-re wan ka-d-uwpo-ka"" (I haven't seen Awtiy). These examples show that the negation is achieved through a prefix attached to the verb, indicating that negation in Awtuw can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions the use of the negative particle ""mo"" and the clitic ""=ba"" for negation. Specifically, it describes a construction where the verb stem ""tl"" is inflected with ""-im"" to signal negative polarity, followed by the existential verb ""bl"" also inflected with the same suffix ""-im"". This indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: It discusses the negative clitic ""=ba"" used to express negation in clauses with a finite verb. The clitic follows the subject suffix or tense suffix, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. Examples provided show the clitic ""=ba"" attached to the verb forms, reinforcing that negation can be marked by a clitic.

- **Paragraph 6**: It describes the negation of deontic forms using the clitic ""=ba"" and the negation particle ""mo"". This further supports the use of clitics in marking negation.

- **Paragraph 7**: It mentions the negative clitic ""=mo"" used in clauses negated with ""=ba"", showing that negation involves clitics attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 10**: It states that medial verbs cannot be marked for negative polarity with ""=ba"", but this does not negate the fact that final verbs can be marked with the clitic ""=ba"" for negation.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that negation in Mian can be marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Chácobo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly mention the use of the negative morpheme =yáma, which attaches to verbs to indicate negation. For instance:

- Paragraph 5 provides examples such as ""a(k)=yáma=kí=a"" (But I have not killed my wife) and ""noʔokaiyona=yáma=kí=a"" (I haven’t made my mother work).
- Paragraph 6 mentions that verbs combine with the negative marker =yama.
- Paragraph 10 shows examples like ""tʃaʔitapi=yáma=ʂo=wɨ́ikiá"" (Don’t eat grandfather!) and ""hatóɨwatihá=kɨ́pi=yáma=ki"" (We haven’t eaten him, mother!).
- Paragraph 19 illustrates the use of ""tʃaniyáma=bɨkí=kɨ"" (They do not speak together).
- Paragraph 29 discusses the use of the negative morpheme =yáma in various constructions, indicating its role in negation.

These examples demonstrate that the negative morpheme =yáma is phonologically bound to the verb, either as a clitic or an affix, marking standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Hup,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Hup can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple instances of the negative suffix -nˆ¤h being used directly on the verb to indicate negation. For example:

- Paragraph 1: ""ham-nˆ¤h-ay"" (go-NEG-INCH) meaning ‘(I’m) not going.’
- Paragraph 2: ""Formally, -nˆ¤h usually occurs as a verbal consonant-initial Boundary Suffix...""
- Paragraph 3: ""In declarative clauses, negation with -nˆ¤h is a nearly symmetric strategy vis-à-vis the positive clause...""
- Paragraph 17: ""Hup prefers a morphological strategy for the negation of clauses. In most cases, this involves a single negative marker -nˆ¤h...""

These examples clearly show that the negative marker -nˆ¤h is an affix that attaches to the verb to indicate negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Kwaza,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kwaza can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The paragraphs describe the use of the negative morpheme -he- as a bound verbal suffix that precedes person and mood marking. This morpheme is used to negate predicates and propositions, as seen in examples like ""ja-'he-da-ki"" (eat-NEG-1S-DEC) meaning ""I did not eat."" Additionally, the negative morpheme -he- can be used in various positions within compounds and can function as a root part of a compound, further indicating its role as a bound morpheme attached to verbs.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Huambisa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huambisa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative verbal morpheme -t͡ʃa attached to the copula itself, as well as the suffix -t͡ʃa being a non-present negative marker and -tsu being used for present tense.
- Paragraph 5 explicitly states that there are two negative suffixes on the verb in Wampis (Huambisa): -t͡ʃa and -t͡su. Examples provided show these suffixes being used to negate verbs.
- Paragraph 6 reiterates the use of the verbal negative suffix -t͡ʃa and mentions the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau used with nominal or adjectival complements.

These paragraphs provide sufficient evidence that negation in Huambisa can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Cocama,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, it is evident that standard negation in Cocama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in multiple instances where the negative particles ""tɨma"" and ""ni"" interact with other morphemes, including the focus marker ""=pura"".

For example:
- Paragraph 1 (11.2.4.2): ""The morpheme =pura sporadically attaches to the negative particle tɨma... In natural texts, =pura attaches to tɨma, but extremely rarely to ni.""
- Paragraph 3 (9.3.1): ""The morpheme tɨma is employed primarily to negate the whole clause, or the verb phrase; however, it can also negate adverbs and noun phrases.""
- Paragraph 7 (4.6.1): ""The language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. While the first is used to negate the whole clause or to negate the predicate, the later is mostly used to negate specific arguments.""

These examples show that the negative particles ""tɨma"" and ""ni"" can be phonologically bound to the verb or other elements within the clause, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Tiriyo,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Tiriyo. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that verbal negation involves negative clauses built around the negative verbal form.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of the negative particle _ta(ike) for non-verbal negation and mentions that the habitual past uses the negative form in -sewa.
3. **Paragraph 10** states that the negative form of the verb is marked with a morpheme, specifically a verbal negative suffix -sewa.
4. **Paragraph 23** explicitly mentions ""Negative forms"" and refers to section 5.4.3.1.3, which deals with negative forms of verbs.
5. **Paragraph 30** provides examples of negative constructions using the suffix -ewa, indicating that negation is marked on the verb.
6. **Paragraph 33** mentions that the negative marker -sewa only occurs on verbs.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Tiriyo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -sewa and the negative form -ewa are used to mark negation directly on the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ticuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ticuna, it is clear that standard negation in Ticuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the standard negator ""tãů"" and its variants, which are used to negate clauses. The examples provided show that ""tãů"" can be attached to verbs to indicate negation, as in ""tãů tàã ̄ chānā-üğ ǘ"" (I haven’t started yet) and ""tãů tá chā-pĕʼütàgú"" (I’ll no longer be with you).
- Paragraph 2 discusses the use of the negative existential verb ""tåʼu"" for negating existential predications, which is a modification of the verb to indicate negation.
- Paragraph 3 further elaborates on the use of ""tãů"" as a standard negator and its application in various contexts, including its attachment to verbs.
- Paragraph 4 provides a summary of the functions related to negative polarity, including standard negation through the adjunction of ""tãů"" to the corresponding positive clause.

These examples demonstrate that Ticuna employs affixes and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Huitoto (Murui),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in multiple instances where the standard negative marker -ñe is used on verbs to indicate negation. For example, in Paragraph 1, it states: ""Negation of predicates is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11)."" Additionally, examples (10.1b) and (10.2b) illustrate the use of -ñe and -ni as negative markers attached to verbs. This pattern is consistently observed throughout the paragraphs, confirming that negation in Huitoto (Murui) involves affixation to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iquito,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Iquito can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verb root in certain types of clauses, such as wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft constructions. This is evident from multiple paragraphs:

- Paragraph 5 states that ""Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negative morpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause.""
- Paragraph 7 mentions that ""In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in which the verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspect information.""
- Paragraph 22 confirms that ""a different negative morpheme -ji is marked on the verb, and the negative marker caa, which precedes the verb in the first type, now follows the verb.""
- Paragraph 26 reiterates that the ""negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verbal stem followed by the tense/aspect information, followed by the negative particle caa.""

These paragraphs collectively indicate that the negative morpheme -ji is indeed an affix that attaches to the verb, thus marking negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Movima,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Movima can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the irrealis marker <a’> or -RED~-a’, which functions as a marker of existential negation when the verb is preceded by the negative particle kas. This irrealis marker is inserted after the first iambic foot of the base and signals negation in negative contexts (e.g., ""kas tij-a’-ka:rim"" meaning ""Nobody is at work"").
- Paragraph 2 discusses the particle kas, which forms a negative clause and results in the predicate being morphologically modified, either through action nominalization (-wa) or infixing reduplication.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negative clauses with verbal predicates, where the negative particle kas is used in combination with action nominalization (-wa) or other negative elements.
- Paragraph 4 illustrates the use of the suffix -baycho in negative contexts, indicating a negative mental state.
- Paragraph 5 and 6 further support the presence of morphological modifications in verbs for negation, such as the suffix -ka indicating impossibility when combined with the negative particle kas.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Movima involves morphological changes to the verb, including affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Bora,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple examples where negation is indicated by the suffix -thm or -thm-ne attached to the verb. For instance, in Paragraph 1, examples like ""teha? o akpakhmnm-thm-(nè)"" ('I did not yawn') and ""teha? o a:hi§è-thé-thm-(nè)"" ('I did not go to eat') show the use of the suffix -thm for negation. Similarly, Paragraph 2 discusses the suffix -thm(-ne) used for negation in finite clauses, as in ""teha? ti-p’è phé:-thm-nè"" ('He did not go') and ""teha? ti-p’è max$ho-thm-(nè)"" ('He has not eaten'). These examples demonstrate that negation is marked by an affix attached to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Wari',"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Wari' can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide relevant information:

- **Paragraph 2**: The verb 'om ‘to not exist’ is used for negation and can be accompanied by an INFL morpheme (e.g., 'omca, 'omto). This indicates that negation can be marked by an inflectional morpheme attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 7**: Mentions the use of postverbal modifiers such as 'a/'ara ‘negative’ and mao ‘negative’, which are used in negative constructions and require Tenseless VICS. This suggests that negation can be marked by postverbal modifiers, which are phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 10**: Describes the use of 'om ‘to not exist’ as the most common way to express negation in COMP sentences, with various INFL morphemes (ca, ta, xi) indicating tense/mood. This further supports the idea that negation involves modifications or affixes/clitics attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 23**: Provides an example of a negative sentence using 'om with an INFL morpheme (e.g., 'omcamaoca), indicating that negation can be marked by an inflectional morpheme attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 30**: Discusses the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’ appearing in simple or COMP sentences, requiring Tenseless VICS, which indicates that negation can be marked by a postverbal modifier attached to the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Wari' can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Aymara (Central) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the relevant pieces of evidence:

1. **Paragraph 4**: ""in the negative, verforming possibility~Vquitiis added (cf.""
   - This suggests that a specific morpheme (possibly an affix) is added to the verb to indicate negation.

2. **Paragraph 9**: ""Thenegativeverbstem;marksthe negative.‘he is lazy.'""
   - This indicates that the verb stem itself can be modified to mark negation.

3. **Paragraph 10**: ""Nayanjjinasjan jachafiajjucchiniti.+ ~chini>+ negative-ti..infix -n- (nayanii) contracted to jan:‘4.""
   - This shows the use of an infix (-n-) and a suffix (-ti) to form the negative.

4. **Paragraph 19**: ""Note the shift of negative -ti from the verb to janiin negative interrogativa4now.!tensetucuyahia'towhosesubjectAspectreplaces'I havetheis(causeto)finish')isthesameasthatofthe maindeterminedbythatofthemainverb.infinitivefinished':theexpressthe notion of completion:khatita'cooked':ending.infix ~jji after e.g.""havinglurithe verbstem can""he did'/lurjjewa ""he did it all'passiveparticipleofkhatifiareplacingtheinfinitive10Aljamsaya‘sellthem'11sum _ufjaiia'totake'tocook'.""
   - This paragraph mentions the negative suffix -ti, which is used to mark negation directly on the verb.

5. **Paragraph 22**: ""sarapcuntantisarapcuntantisarapcdy¥tt: sarapcHtanti2 sarcHy¥tatisarapcvitatisarapcuntatisarapcuntatisarc¥ntisarapeuutiAnalysis:or:allbutthirdpersonforms:verb stem + (plural infix) ending + negative -ti.+ negativeallformsexcept-ca~.+-ayd- +thefirstpersonverb stem + (pluralinfix)+ -ca- + -an-+ ending + -ti.ist person forms: ~atan- + -ti.verb(N.B.

   - This analysis confirms the use of the negative suffix -ti attached to the verb stem.

6. **Paragraph 28**: ""In negativeconstructions,the particlesIninterrogativenegativepunctualsuffix-ti is affixed-wa/-jja are not used.sentences,to negative jani.theThe verbto the declarativenegativeform butIn the 1st personsingularand plural-ta replacese.g.""
   - This further supports the use of the suffix -ti for negation in declarative sentences.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Aymara (Central) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Trumai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Trumai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negation particle ""tak"" modifying the verb in imperative constructions.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negative imperative constructions where the negation particle ""tak"" follows the verb (e.g., ""mapa tak waki"" for ""Do not break it!"").
- Paragraph 5 summarizes the characteristics of negative imperative constructions, showing that the negation particle ""tak"" modifies the verb.
- Paragraph 6 shows the use of ""tak"" to negate verbs in declarative sentences (e.g., ""kuhmu tak ka_in"" for ""not throw away"").
- Paragraph 12 explicitly states that to negate verbal predicates, the negation particle ""tak"" follows the verb.

These examples clearly indicate that the negation particle ""tak"" is phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Apinayé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Apinayé can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that negation of intransitive and transitive verbal predicates is invariably encoded by the clitic sequence ""ket=ne"". This indicates that the negation is phonologically bound to the verb, as ""ket=ne"" is a clitic sequence attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 5**: It provides examples of negation in verbal predicates using ""ket=ne"", showing that the nonfinite form of the verb is required by the negative marker. This further supports that negation is marked by a clitic sequence attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 7**: It explicitly states that verbal predicates are negated with the clitic sequence ""ket=ne"".

These paragraphs collectively confirm that standard negation in Apinayé involves a clitic sequence that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

From the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the negation in Yagua:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""negative suffixes which may or may not precede the main verb."" This indicates that negation can be marked by suffixes attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 15** states, ""Negation is of constituents semantically correlates with constituents in preverbal position."" This suggests that negation involves specific positioning of constituents, but it does not rule out the possibility of affixes or clitics.

3. **Paragraph 31** provides an example: ""Néé...NEG 3PL-kill-COMPLT... 'They didn't kill...'"" Here, the negative particle ""néé"" is used, but it does not explicitly show it as an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 16** lists ""negative"" among other grammatical markers, but it does not specify if it is an affix or clitic.

5. **Paragraph 1** mentions a ""negative particle néé,"" but it does not specify if it is bound to the verb.

Based on the information, particularly from Paragraph 3, which explicitly mentions negative suffixes that may precede the main verb, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Yagua can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Cacua,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Cacua can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Affixation for Negation:**
   - Paragraph 1 provides examples of negative imperative constructions using the suffix `-kabuhú`:
     - Example 108: ""ma=higaʔ-kabuhú"" (2SG=be.sad-NEG.IMP) translates to ""don’t be sad!""
     - Example 109: ""ma=tʃɨj-kabuhú"" (2SG=step.on-NEG.IMP) translates to ""don’t step on me!""
   - Paragraph 9 further confirms the use of the suffix `-kabuhú` for negative imperatives:
     - Example 106: ""ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú"" (2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER) translates to ""don’t be afraid!""

2. **Negation Suffix `-kan/-kap`:**
   - Paragraph 1 also shows the use of the negation suffix `-kan` in declarative sentences:
     - Example 112: ""wã=beh-kan=tʃãhãp"" (1SG=go-NEG=PROG) translates to ""I am not going.""
   - Paragraph 9 provides additional examples:
     - Example 33: ""kǎn=diʔ wã=pĩ-dɨw-kan=hĩ"" (3SG=OBJ 1SG=HAB-carry-NEG=REM.PST) translates to ""I never carried him.""
     - Example 34: ""ʔã=t-ɲǎk-beʔ-ep-kap-ta=be"" (3SG.M=EVID-scream-grow-PST-NEG=EVID=REC.PST) translates to ""maybe he didn’t scream.""

3. **Negation in Existential Clauses:**
   - Paragraph 2 describes the negative existential verb `wîʔikan`, which inherently includes the negation suffix `-kan`:
     - Example 18: ""ʔã=t-wîʔikan=na"" (3SG.M=EVID-not.exist=DECL) translates to ""there is also not going to be the jaguar, they said.""
     - Example 21: ""kǎn kib-wîʔikan-ni=ka"" (3SG.M eye-not.exist-ADJVZ=ASS) translates to ""he is blind"" (lit. ‘there is no eye’).

4. **Negation in Declarative Clauses:**
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that declarative clauses can be negated using the suffix `-kan`:
     - Example 49: ""kět=diʔ wã=ʔɨbʔ-kan=na=hĩ"" (3PL=OBJ 1SG=take.out-NEG=DECL=REM.PST) translates to ""I didn’t take them out.""

These examples clearly demonstrate that standard negation in Cacua can be marked by an affix (such as `-kan/-kap` and `-kabuhú`) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuracare,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Yuracare can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 provides examples where the negative adverb ""nish/nij"" is used immediately before the verb phrase to negate it. For instance, ""nishbobo‐ø=w=ya"" (NEG hit;kill‐3=PL=NVR) translates to ""They did not kill him then."" This shows that negation is closely tied to the verb phrase.
- Paragraph 1 also mentions that adjectives and nouns functioning as predicates can be negated in the same way as verbs, indicating a consistent strategy across different types of predicates.
- Paragraph 1 further illustrates that auxiliaries are negated by placing ""nish/nij"" before the auxiliary + main verb, reinforcing the idea that negation is directly linked to the verb phrase.
- Paragraph 1 discusses a special construction involving the negative adverb ""nish/nij"" and the limited degree marker ""-mash,"" which indicates absolute negation, further showing the use of affixes in negation.
- Paragraph 1 also mentions the independent form ""nij‐ta,"" which consists of the negative adverb ""nish/nij"" and the middle marker ""-tA,"" used for existential negation, indicating the use of affixes in negation.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Yuracare involves modifications or additions (affixes/clitics) directly associated with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kuna can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. The key evidence comes from Paragraph 1, which explicitly states that the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to the verb to negate a sentence. This suffix can be attached directly to the verb stem or immediately following an aspect suffix, such as the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi.

Here are the relevant excerpts from Paragraph 1:

- ""A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‘no’ to the verb.""
- ""The suffix is attached to the verb stem or immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi.""

These statements clearly indicate that the negation is achieved through a suffix that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined in the task.

Uru,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Uru can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. This conclusion is drawn from multiple examples where negation is marked by the morpheme ""ana"" combined with other clitics or affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. For instance, in paragraph 1, the example ""anaxuwa sels-cay ana-pini slekisini"" shows the negation ""ana"" combined with the affirmative clitic ""-pini"" and the declarative ""-cay"" attached to the verb ""sels"" (be). Similarly, in paragraph 2, the example ""ana-pini culu xala-m kuna-cu-cay"" demonstrates the negation ""ana"" combined with the affirmative clitic ""-pini"" and the declarative ""-cay"" attached to the verb ""kuna"" (kill). These examples indicate that negation in Uru can indeed be marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Camsá,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Camsá can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - **Affixes:** The paragraphs provide multiple examples where negation is marked by prefixes on the verb. For instance, the prefix **at-** is used for negation, as seen in the examples:
     - ""ndoñ ke-s̈-at-amënts̈na"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-tired) meaning ""I’m not tired.""
     - ""ndoñ ki-n-at-apten"" (NEG IRR-EVI-NEG-rain) meaning ""It’s not raining.""
   - **Modification of the Verb:** The verb can also be modified by the irrealis prefix **ke-** and the negative prefix **at-**. These prefixes are used together to indicate negation, as seen in:
     - ""ndoñ ke-ts-at-abowenyná"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-remember) meaning ""I don’t remember.""
   - **Clitics:** The use of clitics is also evident in the examples provided, such as the use of **ndoñ** as a negator word that precedes the verb and can be combined with other prefixes:
     - ""ndoñ ke-s̈-at-amënts̈na"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-tired) meaning ""I’m not tired.""
   - **Other Prefixes:** The prefix **nd-** is used in some tenses, such as the distant past, to indicate negation:
     - ""ndoñe benache ndoñe i-mu-nd-en-abwache"" (NEG trail NEG DIS-3PL-NEG-REC-visit) meaning ""Since there was no trail they didn't visit there.""

   The examples clearly show that negation in Camsá can be marked by affixes (e.g., **at-**, **nd-**), clitics (e.g., **ndoñ**), and modifications of the verb (e.g., **ke-**).

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Warao,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, it is clear that standard negation in Warao can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the suffix **-naka** 'NEG' is used to express negation and is directly attached to the verb root. This is evident in the following examples:

- **""Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG', whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker -naka 'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality overtly.""**
- **""hirima nao-naka ta-te""** (Your father does not come)
- **""ine namina-naka ta-bu-te""** (I really do not know)
- **""osibu ine nahoro-naka-turu ta-te""** (I do not want to eat fish)

These examples show that the negation suffix **-naka** is attached directly to the verb root, indicating that negation is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Cuiba,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 8 mentions the verb clitic ""-yo"" as a negative marker, and Paragraph 11 provides examples of the negative marker ""jopa"" being used in various contexts, suggesting it can be attached to verbs.

For instance, Paragraph 8 states:
```
The Verb Group Clitics
VbClit20 = -yo ‘negative’
```

Additionally, Paragraph 11 provides examples such as:
```
Neg: jopa S: huaca O): naca P: sinayo
‘not—the-bird—us—bite-he-not’ : (The bird doesn’t bite us.)
```

These examples indicate that negation can be marked by clitics or affixes attached to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Apurinã by examining the morphological and syntactic structures described.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph describes two types of negation in Apurinã: periphrastic negation and morphological negation.
   - Morphological negation involves the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" and the negative relative marker ""-katu"".
   - Example (108) shows the verb ""areka"" (be good) modified by ""m-"" to form ""m-areka"" (not be good), and further negated in a relative clause with ""-katu"".
   - Periphrastic negation uses the particle ""kona"" which can precede or follow a pre-verbal constituent.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the negative particle ""kona"" used for negation and as an answer to polar questions. It also mentions phonological shortening of ""kona"" in some speech varieties.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph focuses on interrogative speech acts and does not provide relevant information about negation.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph discusses relative pronominal markers and their functions, including marking polarity (positive/negative) in verbs.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph provides a table of relative pronominal markers, including those that mark negative polarity.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph discusses the distribution and function of relative pronominal markers, including those that mark negative polarity.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of actorless passive relative clauses and their inflection for gender and polarity.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of shortened forms of the negative particle ""kona"".

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - This paragraph is part of the dissertation's introduction and does not provide relevant information about negation.

### Conclusion:

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The morphological negation in Apurinã is marked by the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" and the negative relative marker ""-katu"", which are affixes that attach to the verb.
   - The periphrastic negation uses the particle ""kona"", which is not phonologically bound to the verb.
   - The examples provided show that the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" directly modifies the verb to indicate negation.

2. **Conclusion**: 1

Standard negation in Apurinã can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.",1,1
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Kadiwéu.

Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Only the first verb can be modified by a negative morpheme,"" which implies that negation can be marked by modifying the verb.

Paragraph 25 provides explicit examples of negation markers that attach to the verb:
- ""+aG"" is a proclitic that attaches to the verb of the main clause.
- ""daGa~+"" attaches to the left of a complementizer and has scope over the subordinate clause.

These examples show that negation in Kadiwéu can be marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Paragraph 2 indicates that negation involves modifying the verb.
   - Paragraph 25 provides specific examples of negation markers that attach to verbs, demonstrating that negation can be marked by affixes or clitics.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Karajá,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Karajá can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the negative morpheme ""-ko)"" is suffixed to the verb to negate the entire sentence. This is a clear indication that negation can be marked by an affix that attaches to the verb. Additionally, the same paragraph mentions that the negative morpheme can be followed by the imperfective clitic, further supporting the presence of phonologically bound elements in negation.

Paragraph 3 also provides examples of negative imperatives where the negation is marked by the suffix ""-ko)"" attached to action nouns, which are derived from verbs. This further reinforces the use of affixes in marking negation.

Given this information, it is evident that negation in Karajá can indeed be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
