Supyire,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Supyire involves modifications to the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that realis complements of manipulative verbs lose high tone marking in the negative, indicating a modification of the verb form in negative constructions.
2. **Paragraph 5** describes clause final negative particles like ""mä"" and ""mi"" that follow the verb, suggesting that negation is marked at the end of the clause, which can be considered as phonologically bound to the verb.
3. **Paragraph 6** states that negation is doubly marked in the clause, with a clause final negative particle and a marking in the auxiliary position immediately following the subject. This implies that the auxiliary (which is part of the verb phrase) is modified for negation.
4. **Paragraph 13** provides a table summarizing negative marking in auxiliary positions, showing that different tense-aspects use specific negative markers, including low tones and additional auxiliaries like ""pye"" for negation. This indicates that negation involves modifications to the verb or auxiliary.
5. **Paragraph 18** mentions that certain types of subordinate clauses are not amenable to negation and describes the placement of negative markers in complex sentences, further supporting the idea that negation involves specific morphological changes to the verb or auxiliary.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Supyire can be marked by modifications to the verb or by affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Jamsay,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly describe the use of suffixes for negation:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that negation is expressed by verbal suffixation, with distinct negative suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs (e.g., -go@- for imperfective negation and -li@- for perfective negation).
- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negative inflected verbs using suffixes (e.g., lu$gu$ro$-jE$-lu@-m for ""I have not searched"").
- **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of negative suffixes like -li@- and -go@- for perfective and imperfective verbs respectively.
- **Paragraph 7** reiterates the use of the suffix -go@- for imperfective negation.
- **Paragraph 8** confirms the use of the suffix -li@- for perfective negation.
- **Paragraph 14** describes the use of the suffix -la@- for negating adjectival and stative predicates.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that Jamsay employs suffixes to mark negation directly on the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the language Ma'di uses negation particles such as ""kü"" for nonpast negation and ""kûrù"" for past negation. These particles are described as being placed in sentence-final positions and are not phonologically bound to the verb. The verb remains uninflected when these negation particles are used.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 5**: ""The verb is negated by a sentence-final negation word kü or küru; the verb must be uninflected and tense is expressed by the choice of negation word.""
2. **Paragraph 8**: ""NEG(N)kü can negate only an uninflected verb.""
3. **Paragraph 11**: ""The past negation particle kuru must co-occur with an uninflected verb.""
4. **Paragraph 13**: ""A verb negated with the past negation particle küru or the nonpast negation particle kü. In both cases the verb has the syntax and morphology of an uninflected verb.""

These points indicate that the negation particles ""kü"" and ""kûrù"" are not affixes or clitics that attach to the verb. Instead, they are separate words that follow the verb, which remains uninflected. Therefore, standard negation in Ma'di is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The negation particles ""kü"" and ""kûrù"" are used to negate verbs, but they do not attach to the verb as affixes or clitics.
- The verb remains uninflected when these negation particles are used, indicating that the negation is not marked by modifying the verb itself.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Bangime,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Bangime can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that transitive verbs in Class Two and Three take the [–r] suffix, or the [–d] allomorph, in the negative completive aspect. This indicates that the verb itself is modified by an affix in the context of negation.
   
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of negative verb forms where the verb root is followed by the [–r] suffix in the completive aspect. For instance, ""bíé n déɛ̀bíè déɛ́–rè"" (lick) and ""bíé n nìèbíè nìɛ̀–rè"" (drink) show the use of the [–r] suffix in the negative completive aspect.

3. **Paragraph 11** further supports this by listing intransitive verbs that take the [–r] suffix in the completive negative form, such as ""jíèbíè jé–rò"" (get up) and ""téɛ̀bíé té–rɛ̀"" (lost).

These examples clearly show that negation in Bangime can involve the use of a suffix attached to the verb, which qualifies as an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Gumuz,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that in both NoG (Northern Gumuz) and parts of SoG (Southern Gumuz), the negative clitic /=(a)ŋg̩ ó/ attaches to the end of the conjugated verb. This indicates that the negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of negation in both NoG and SoG, showing the negative clitic =ŋgó attached to the verb. For instance, ""á-a-ŋár-agá-kʼo=ŋgó"" (3SG.INTR-RECP-take-NFUT-HEAD=NEG) translates to ""A sheep and a goat don’t marry.""

3. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph explicitly states that the negative clitics /=ŋgó/ and /=cê/ are used in Gumuz and are restricted to attaching to main clause verbs. This reinforces the idea that negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the use of negative auxiliaries for subordinate clauses but confirms that the negative clitics =ŋgó and =cê are used for main clause verbs.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Gumuz can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, the correct option is 1.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Koyra Chiini can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the morphemes ""si"" and ""sii"" for negation, with ""si"" being used as the imperfective negative (ImpfNeg) marker. It is stated that ""si"" is a preverbal MAN morpheme, indicating that it attaches to the verb to mark negation.
   
2. **Paragraph 16** provides a detailed description of the MAN morphemes and sequences, including ""si"" for indicative imperfective negative (ImpfNeg) and ""na"" for indicative perfective negative (Neg). These morphemes follow the subject NP and immediately precede the verb, showing that they are bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 14** discusses the subjunctive mood and mentions ""ma si"" as the negative counterpart, where ""si"" is glossed as ""Neg."" This further supports that ""si"" is used in combination with the verb to indicate negation.

4. **Paragraph 20** provides examples where ""si"" and ""na"" are used as negative markers in sentences, showing their role in negating the verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Koyra Chiini involves morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the language Seme uses a clause-final particle ""bo"" to mark negation. This particle does not attach to the verb as an affix or clitic, nor does it modify the verb itself. Instead, it appears as a separate word following the verb and other elements in the clause.

Here is the relevant evidence from the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 3: ""PST NEG Tòl Sɛ̀mɛ̀ Orodara Siamou jɛ́ɛn language kwɔsé jɛ́ɛn only language kwɔsé jɛ́ɛn only language má kɛl ín bo. other speak.PERF PST NEG In the past, in Orodara, no other language but Siamou was spoken.""
- Paragraph 10: ""À ri le dì bo. food eat.PRFV NEG 3SG FIN He didn't eat food.""
- Paragraph 12: ""Negation is generally marked by a clause-final negation particle, bo (101).""

These examples consistently show that the negation marker ""bo"" is a separate particle that follows the verb and other elements in the clause, rather than being an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, standard negation in the language Seme cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tima,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tima can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the negative particle 'kV-' is procliticized to a verb and the negative particle '-Vŋ' is encliticized to a verb or verb phrase. The examples provided show these particles attached directly to the verb, indicating that they form a phonological unit with the verb.
- **Paragraph 2**: It reiterates that Tima uses two obligatory negative particles, 'kV-' (proclitic) and '-Vŋ' (enclitic), in a negative sentence. This supports the idea that these particles are bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 3**: It describes the formula for negated clauses as NEG + VP + NEG, and mentions that the negative particles harmonize with the verb root, further indicating that they are phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 4**: It confirms that the most common strategy of negation in Tima involves the use of the two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in a single clause, especially in negating declarative clauses.
- **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of negative perfective aspect, showing the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that the negative construction of declarative sentences will be presented, indicating a systematic approach to negation involving these particles.
- **Paragraph 7**: Shows examples of negative imperative and subjunctive forms, again using the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ'.
- **Paragraph 8**: Provides further examples of negative imperative and subjunctive forms, reinforcing the use of these particles.
- **Paragraph 9**: Discusses imperfective negation and provides examples where the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' are used.
- **Paragraph 10**: Mentions that Tima uses a large number of affixes, including negative markers, which attach to the verb.
- **Paragraph 11**: Describes the verb structure in Tima, indicating that negative markers occupy specific slots in the verb structure.
- **Paragraph 12**: Mentions that the second enclitic negative marker is encliticized to the end of the clause in transitive verbs, negating the whole clause.
- **Paragraph 13**: Discusses how tense, aspect, and mood are inflected on the verb, including negation.
- **Paragraph 14**: Provides a general discussion on clitics, supporting the idea that negative markers in Tima are clitics.
- **Paragraph 15**: Provides examples of stative aspect markers on verbs, showing the complexity of verb morphology in Tima.
- **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the overlap between tense, aspect, and mood, including negation.
- **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of imperative forms, showing the use of negative markers.
- **Paragraph 18**: Provides a detailed structure of the Tima verb, showing the slots for negative markers.
- **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of subjunctive forms, showing the use of negative markers.
- **Paragraph 20**: Discusses noun class systems and inherent grammatical categories on verbs, including negation.

Given this extensive evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Tima involves the use of negative particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
!Xun (Ekoka),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka). Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that verbs in !Xun can be negated by the proclitic *l6a.
   - ""They are negated by the proclitic *l6a (see section 3.3).""

2. **Paragraph 10** provides additional details about the negation markers:
   - ""Verbal negation is fairly uniform across all dialects: (a) There are two markers, each associated with a clearly defined range of functions, see table 3-4. (b) Negation markers are pre-clitics (in case there is a verb). (c) The negation markers are *l6a (general negation) and *kora (negative existence)...""

3. **Paragraph 13** further supports the use of negation markers:
   - ""What is common to all dialects is that TAM (tense—aspect-modality) markers and negation are placed between subject and verb...""

From these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) can be marked by a proclitic (*l6a) that is phonologically bound to the verb. This proclitic forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being considered an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negation marker *l6a is described as a proclitic, which means it is phonologically bound to the verb.
- The information provided consistently indicates that negation is marked by this proclitic in the context of verbal predicates.

### Conclusion:
1

",1,1
Katcha,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it can be determined that standard negation in Katcha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, paragraph 12 provides an example of passive morphology where the verb is modified by a suffix ""-tene"" to indicate passive voice. Although this example is about passive voice and not negation, it demonstrates that Katcha uses suffixes to modify verbs for grammatical purposes. This suggests that similar morphological processes could be used for negation. Additionally, paragraph 13 discusses the use of relative markers that cliticize to the verb, further supporting the idea that Katcha employs bound morphemes for grammatical functions.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ijo (Kolokuma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ijo (Kolokuma) can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3 mentions that sentences are made negative by the introduction of the marker ""-a"" between the last verb and the aspect marker. This indicates that the negation marker ""-a"" is an affix that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Additionally, Paragraph 1 provides examples such as ""eri, d6ma tun-a"" (he didn't sing) and ""eri, kyrej, bjph?, b6-a"" (he could not come here), further supporting the presence of a verb-affixed negation marker.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Emai,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3.1.2 (Predicate negation) provides detailed information on how negative inflection is expressed in Emai. It mentions three mutually exclusive forms of negative inflection: Perfect Negation (ì), Prospective Negation (khà), and Past Absolute Negation (yà). These forms occur with a subject pronoun or subject concord and affect the verb's tone.

For example:
- Perfect Negation (ì) is expressed with a low tone ì, and in third person monotransitive clauses, the verb tone is low (è) (Example: ""ó ì è émàè"" meaning ""He did not eat food"").
- Prospective Negation (khà) uses a low tone khà, and similarly affects the verb's tone (Example: ""ó khà è ólí émàè"" meaning ""He will not eat the food"").
- Past Absolute Negation (yà) uses a low tone yà and also affects the verb's tone (Example: ""ó yà shèn úkpùn"" meaning ""He never sells cloth"").

These examples demonstrate that negation in Emai involves modifications to the verb, specifically through the use of affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Ik,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ik involves the use of negator verbs such as ńt- and ma-/na-. These negator verbs are described as filling the clause-initial slot, taking modal suffixes, and being modified by tense enclitics, which indicates that they are phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, the negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood, showing a close syntactic and phonological relationship between the negator and the main verb.

Here are some key points from the paragraphs that support this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that negation in Ik is signaled by negator verbs that show agreement for an impersonal 3-person subject and take modal suffixes. The negator verbs are described as defective verbs rather than merely negating particles because they fill the clause-initial slot, take modal suffixes, and can be modified by tense enclitics.

2. **Paragraph 3**: It explains that the negating verbs fill the syntactic slot for a clause’s main verb, and the negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood. Examples like ""ńt-áƙó-dⁱ"" (You don’t go) and ""má-á=naaƙó-dⁱ"" (You didn’t go) show the negator verb ńt- or ma- taking modal suffixes and being closely linked to the main verb.

3. **Paragraph 5**: It provides examples of negated clauses where the negator verb is followed by the negated verb in the irrealis mood, such as ""má-á=beeŋk-aƙó-íⁱ"" (I didn’t go).

These points indicate that the negator verbs in Ik are phonologically bound to the verb, either through affixation or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**: The evidence from the descriptive grammar shows that standard negation in Ik involves negator verbs that are phonologically bound to the main verb through affixation or modification. This satisfies the criteria for marking standard negation by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides clear evidence of the negative marker ""ma"" being used in conjunction with the verb. The examples show the negative marker ""ma"" appearing before the verb and forming a phonological unit with it:
   - ""inzi ma m-dbhi"" (I have not cultivated the field)
   - ""ma m-dbhi"" (I have not cultivated the field just now)

2. **Paragraph 5** further supports this by explaining that the negative markers ""inzi,"" ""inza,"" and ""mba"" can take different positions in the sentence, including non-initial positions where they attach to the verb:
   - ""When used non-initially, the initial vowel i- is deleted, a feature found with all I-initial words, see also 2.2. The resultant forms are nzi, nza, mba.""

3. **Paragraph 10** mentions that affirmative and negative markers can only take one of two positions in the clause: the initial adjunct position or immediately following the conjugated verb or auxiliary verb:
   - ""Unlike the previously mentioned clause-level particles, affirmative and negative markers can only take one of two positions in the clause: the initial adjunct position or immediately following the conjugated verb or auxiliary verb.""

These pieces of information collectively indicate that the negative markers in Ngiti can indeed be phonologically bound to the verb, either as affixes or clitics.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, it is evident that standard negation in Sidaama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation**: 
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the negative suffix **-kki** which negates the verb in various subordinate clauses (e.g., ""sell-3SG.F-IMPRF.3-NEG=NPC.F.CMPL"" and ""give-3SG.M-IMPRF.3-3SG.F-NEG=NPC.M.CMPL"").
   - Paragraph 5 further elaborates that the negative suffix **-kki** is always attached to the verb of a subordinate clause, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

2. **Cliticization**:
   - Paragraph 4 introduces the negative proclitic **di=** which is phonologically bound to the beginning of a clause-final constituent or a constituent in the focus position. This clitic can attach to verbs, as shown in examples like ""NEG=exist.P.PRF.3"" and ""NEG=give-EP-3SG.F-P.PRF.3"".
   - Paragraph 14 provides additional examples of the negative clitic **di=** attaching to verbs in relative clauses, such as ""NEG=swim-3SG.F-CNN"" and ""NEG=swim-3SG.F-INF-MANNER"".

3. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 18 discusses the use of the negative proclitic **di=** in complex verb constructions, indicating that negation can be marked by modifying the verb form itself, as in ""NEG=enter-3SG.F-S.PRF.3"".

Given these examples, it is clear that Sidaama employs both affixation and cliticization to mark standard negation directly on the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Mursi can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that negation in Mursi involves bound circumclitics for verbs in the imperfective aspect and a combination of a negative particle and an enclitic for verbs in the perfective aspect. Specifically, it mentions:
   - Imperfective aspect: Negation is marked by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó].
   - Perfective aspect: Negation involves the negative particle ŋànì and the negative enclitic =ó attached to the verb root.

2. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph further elaborates on the use of circumclitics for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect, confirming the presence of the proclitic ŋà= and the enclitic =ó.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides examples of negation in Mursi, showing the use of the circumclitics ŋà= and =ó around the verb root in the imperfective aspect.

4. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the formation of negative imperatives using the negative proclitic ŋà= and the negative enclitic =ó, further supporting the use of bound morphemes for negation.

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions the use of the negative particle ŋànì and the negative enclitic =ó for negating verbs in the perfective aspect, reinforcing the earlier points.

6. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the use of the negative circumclitics in various contexts, including the imperfective aspect, and provides examples of their usage.

### Conclusion: 1

The evidence from the provided paragraphs clearly indicates that standard negation in Mursi can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the correct response is 1.",1,1
Majang,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Majang involves the use of a negative auxiliary ""k-"" which is inflected for person and combined with a negative verb form. The negative verb form itself is marked with suffixes such as ""-ɛːL"" or ""-iːt"" depending on the verb class. This indicates that negation in Majang can be marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. 

For example, in Paragraph 3, it is mentioned that ""The Majang language uses a fully inflectable auxiliary k- for creating negative sentences in conjunction with the negative verbal nouns."" Additionally, Paragraph 18 provides examples of negative verb forms that require the negative auxiliary ""k-"" and are marked with suffixes like ""-ɛːL"" or ""-iːt"". This demonstrates that the negative marking is indeed bound to the verb.

Therefore, the evidence supports that standard negation in Majang can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Birri,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Birri can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. This conclusion is drawn from several pieces of evidence:

- **Paragraph 3**: The examples of negation in declarative sentences show the use of the particle ""sa"" at the end of the verb phrase. For instance, ""I am not Birri"" is translated as ""amd viri sa,"" where ""sa"" is the negative marker attached to the verb phrase.
- **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides further examples of negation with the particle ""sa"" at the end of the verb phrase, such as ""They are not many"" translated as ""atyone sha"" and ""I have not"" translated as ""ana gama Bd-sa.""
- **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of negation in various contexts, such as ""I do not eat"" translated as ""monyo (e)de-sha"" and ""They do not smoke opium"" translated as ""aydne bangi-sha."" The negative particle ""sha"" is consistently placed at the end of the verb phrase, indicating it is phonologically bound to the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that the negative marker ""sa"" or ""sha"" is used as an affix or clitic that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb root.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Tamashek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tamashek can be marked by modifications to the verb or by affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of a special LoImpfN stem for negation in the imperfective aspect, which involves blocking certain phonological features and applying a specific melody. This indicates a modification of the verb for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 2** describes how the perfective negative (PerfN) stem is formed by modifying the verb stem, specifically through ablaut changes (e.g., converting ""ae"" to ""e""). This is another instance of verb modification for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 10** further supports this by explaining that the PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding an ablaut formative, realized as an ""e"" vowel in certain contexts, indicating a morphological change to the verb.

These paragraphs collectively show that Tamashek uses verb modifications (such as ablaut changes) to mark standard negation, which fits the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Coptic,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Coptic employs several strategies for negation, including the use of affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides examples of negative tenses where negation is marked by prefixes such as ""N-"" and ""n-"". For instance, ""N-q-NA-CWTM AN"" (he is not going to hear) and ""N-N6-q-CWTH AN"" (he was not hearing) show the use of the prefix ""N-"" attached to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes the syntactically discontinuous negation ""N- ... aN"", where ""N-"" is a clause-initial particle that attaches to the verb, and ""an"" is a clause-internal negation adverb. This indicates that the negation involves a bound morpheme.

- **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions three morphologically distinct negation strategies, including the double negation ""N- ... an"" and the negative auxiliary verb ""TH"" (to do not). The double negation involves the prefix ""N-"" attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses negative tenses marked by a morpheme-initial labial or velar nasal ""w-"" or ""N-"". These negative conjugation patterns originate from the merger between negation and the relevant tense-aspect-mood marker into a single morph, indicating that negation is marked by an affix.

- **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph describes the use of the negative auxiliary verb ""TH"" in various negative tenses, such as the Negative Temporal ""NT€P6-q-TH-CWTM"" and the Negative Terminative ""wanTe-q-TH-COTM"". The auxiliary verb ""TH"" is used as a marker of negative polarity and is attached to the verb.

These examples demonstrate that Coptic uses affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Igbo can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that negation markers are marked on the first verb, which suggests that negation is directly associated with the verb.
2. **Paragraph 3** provides clear evidence of morphological negation. It mentions the use of a harmonizing general negative marker `=ghi` immediately following the past tense marker or auxiliaries in various tenses. Additionally, it mentions a harmonizing negative prefix `A-` on the verb and auxiliaries, as well as changes in tone patterns associated with negation.
3. **Paragraph 16** provides an example of a negative stative sentence where the verb is marked with the negative suffix `=ghI`.

These examples indicate that negation in Igbo involves affixes and modifications directly on the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mambai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that negative forms are marked by negative particles yá and gá, and that yá is a clitic, as it takes the nasal value of the last syllable of the preceding morpheme.
- Paragraph 3 explains that verbal negation is marked on Indicative subject pronouns, which exhibit a CVV shape for negative forms, indicating a modification of the verb.
- Paragraph 5 states that negation is always signaled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some additional indicator, and mentions that yá is accompanied by a modification of the structure of subject pronouns.
- Paragraph 8 summarizes that negative verb forms are marked with negation particles and negative subject pronouns, which further supports the presence of phonologically bound elements in negation.

These points collectively indicate that negation in Mambai involves modifications of the verb and the use of clitics or affixes.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingessana,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingessana is marked by the negative particle ""wá,"" which always occurs clause-finally and modifies or negates the preceding verb, verb predicate, or clause. This particle is not phonologically bound to the verb, as it can be separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. Therefore, there is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

2. The paragraphs provide consistent evidence that the negative particle ""wá"" functions independently and does not attach to the verb or modify it directly. This is supported by multiple examples where ""wá"" appears clause-finally, separated from the verb by other elements.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Gorowa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Gorowa by examining the relevant information about how negation is marked in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - **Negation is accomplished by the enclitic =ká(ng)**.
   - **Verbal negation**: The negative clitic =káng (often reduced to =ká) attaches to verb roots only if the roots have been extended by the suffix -a (in the present tense) and -i (in the past tense).
   - Examples provided show the clitic =ká attached to the verb roots extended by these suffixes:
     - Present Tense: ""tam motloo ngi xu’aká"" (know.F -NEG.PRES)
     - Past Tense: ""inós tunáy ngu xu’iká’"" (know.F -NEG.PST)

2. **Paragraph 9**:
   - **Topic marker as part of negative morphology on nouns**: The negative clitic =ká(ng) attaches to forms extended with the topic clitic.

From this information, it is clear that the standard negation in Gorowa involves a clitic (=ká(ng)) that attaches to the verb roots extended by specific tense suffixes. This clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, as it forms a unit with the verb root and its tense suffix.

### Conclusion: 1

The evidence from the provided paragraphs indicates that standard negation in Gorowa can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the correct option is 1.",1,1
Shatt,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Shatt can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 16 provides examples of verbs and their forms, including negation. The verb form section mentions that verbs can take various suffixes, including those for negation. For instance, the verb ""saxe"" (refuses) can take different suffixes to indicate various forms, and it is reasonable to infer that negation could be one of these forms.

Additionally, the presence of suffixes such as -d, -t, and others that modify verbs suggests that negation could be marked similarly. Although explicit examples of negation are not provided in the given paragraphs, the structure and use of suffixes in verb forms imply that negation could be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Koromfe,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It states that a sentence can be negated either with the negative particle ""ba"" positioned before the verb or by using a negative subject pronoun from a given list, all of which are proclitics on the verb. This indicates that the negative subject pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that the negative personal pronouns always shorten the long final ""aa"" of a following progressive verb form, suggesting a phonological interaction between the negative pronouns and the verb.

3. **Paragraph 18**: It provides a list of negative prefixal pronouns that can only be used as the (prefixed) subject of a verb, giving the verb a negated reading. This further supports the idea that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb through the use of these negative pronouns.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negative subject pronouns, which are proclitics, attach directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.

### Reasoning:
- **Negative subject pronouns** are described as proclitics that attach to the verb.
- **Phonological interaction** between the negative pronouns and the verb is mentioned, indicating that they form a phonological unit.
- **Negative prefixal pronouns** are used to negate the verb directly.

### Conclusion:

Nobiin,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Nobiin can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of the verb men-/min- ‘not to be’ in various periphrastic constructions for negation. This indicates that negation is achieved through a separate verb rather than an affix or clitic attached to the main verb. However, it also mentions that in many instances, an emphatic postposition -/o is attached to the negative verb, which suggests some form of phonological binding.

2. **Paragraph 6** provides more direct evidence. It mentions that the element -min/-muun- is inserted between the verbal base and the ending to form the negative present tense. This clearly indicates that negation in Nobiin can be marked by a modification of the verb through the insertion of a negative morpheme.

3. **Paragraph 8** further supports this by discussing the use of -moon- as a variant of -min/-muun- in negative constructions, reinforcing the idea that negation involves modifying the verb with a bound morpheme.

4. **Paragraph 13** also mentions the suffix -kon/-ko used in past tense constructions, which has replaced older forms in the negative. This suggests that negation involves suffixation in certain tenses.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Nobiin can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Nyimang. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of negation where the negative marker ""fa"" precedes the verb:
   - ""a fa wo"" (do not know)
   - ""endu fa kil"" (He does not understand)

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph also shows the use of ""fa"" for negation:
   - ""a fa WEna"" (I don't want it)
   - ""a fa tai"" (I am not going)
   - ""endu fa n;;on"" (She is not carrying a basket)

3. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph continues to show the use of ""fa"" in negation:
   - ""a fa taiIJidar"" (Don't be afraid!)
   - ""a fa WEna"" (I don't want it)

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negative marker ""fa"" is used to negate verbs. However, ""fa"" is a separate particle that precedes the verb and does not attach to the verb as an affix or clitic. It is not phonologically bound to the verb, which means it does not form a single phonological unit with the verb.

Given this information, we can conclude that standard negation in Nyimang is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, it is marked by a separate particle ""fa"".

**Reasoning**:
- The negative marker ""fa"" is consistently shown as a separate particle that precedes the verb.
- There is no indication that ""fa"" attaches to the verb as an affix or clitic.
- The provided examples do not show any modification of the verb itself for negation.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Lamé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Lamé (referred to as Pévé in the text) is marked by the negative marker ""tsú"" immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative marker ""mì"" at the end of the clause. These markers are not affixes or clitics that attach to the verb, nor do they modify the verb itself. Instead, they are particles that are separate from the verb and do not form a phonological unit with it. Therefore, the negation markers ""tsú"" and ""mì"" do not meet the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Bininj Gun-Wok,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Bininj Gun-Wok can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs describe the use of negative particles such as ""djama,"" ""minj,"" and ""marrek"" which precede the verb and are integral to the negation process. These particles are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb phrase.

For instance, in Paragraph 2, it is mentioned that ""negation is signalled by the negative particle alone"" when discussing non-past events, and the examples provided show the negative particle immediately preceding the verb. This demonstrates that the negative particle forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

Additionally, Paragraph 13.9.1 discusses the use of negative interjections and particles, further supporting the conclusion that negation involves elements that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wambaya,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Wambaya can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that the negative particles ""yangula"" and ""guyala"" appear in initial position in the clause and that the verb does not inflect for future tense in negative clauses. This suggests that the negation involves a structural change in the verb form.

2. **Paragraph 5** provides an example of a negative future tense clause where the verb occurs in the non-future form: ""Yangula irr-agba jiyawu"" (NEG 3PLA-HYP give(NF)) meaning ""They will not give it to him."" Here, ""yangula"" is the negative particle, and the verb ""give"" is in a non-future form, indicating a modification of the verb in the presence of negation.

3. **Paragraph 9** includes examples where the auxiliary contains the hypothetical suffix in negative constructions, such as ""Yangula ngu-ny-u daguma"" (NEG 1SG.A-20-FUT hit) meaning ""I'm not going to hit you."" This shows that the verb form changes in the context of negation.

4. **Paragraph 10** further supports this with another example: ""Yangula ngu-ny-u daguma"" (NEG hit), indicating that the verb form is altered in negative constructions.

5. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of negative imperative constructions where the verb appears without future tense marking, such as ""Alyu junmi/junmi-j-ba!"" (NEG.IMP cut(NF)/Cut-TH-FUT) meaning ""Don't cut it!"" Here, ""Alyu"" is the negative imperative particle, and the verb ""cut"" is in a non-future form, showing a modification of the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that negation in Wambaya involves modifications to the verb form, either by changing the tense marking or by using specific negative particles that affect the verb's morphology.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Wardaman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions negative particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" which are used as clausal negators and generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb or before particle plus finite verb combinations. This suggests that these particles are not affixes or clitics but separate words.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences with ""wonggo"" preceding the verb, such as:
   - (750) wonggo ngawun-wo-ndi 'I didn't give them [any]'.
   - (751) wonggo ngarrug ngarr-we-ndi 'We were not born'.
   These examples reinforce that ""wonggo"" is a separate word and not an affix or clitic.

3. **Paragraph 3** continues to show ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" used as separate words preceding verbs or nominal phrases, such as:
   - (744) yinyang wonggo neg yi-marnany-garang 'You do not have a husband'.
   - (746) wonggo nu-bu-n 'you are not killing it'.
   Again, these examples indicate that the negators are separate words.

4. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** do not provide new information about the method of negation but continue to use ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" in similar contexts.

5. **Paragraph 6** mentions that negative imperatives are formed with particles alone, without any nominal arguments, by suffixation of -gay ~ -way to the particle. However, this is a different construction and does not indicate that the negation is bound to the verb.

6. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** reiterate the use of ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" as separate particles for negation.

7. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** continue to show examples of ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" used as separate words preceding verbs or nominal phrases.

8. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** provide further examples of ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" used in negation, consistently showing them as separate words.

9. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** do not provide new information relevant to the method of negation.

10. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** continue to show ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" used as separate words for negation.

11. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** do not provide new information relevant to the method of negation.

12. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** continue to show ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" used as separate words for negation.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Wardaman is marked by separate particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" that precede the verb or nominal phrase. These particles are not affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Gooniyandi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Gooniyandi is marked by the particle ""mangaddi"" which functions as a Propositional Modifier. This particle is not phonologically bound to the verb but rather stands as a separate word. The paragraphs consistently describe ""mangaddi"" as a negative particle that modifies the entire proposition, indicating that the proposition in its scope is false. There is no indication of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

For example, in Paragraph 5, it is stated: ""This lexeme is a negative particle which usually has the role of Propositional Modifier, and indicates that the proposition in its scope is false."" This description aligns with the usage of ""mangaddi"" in the examples provided, where it appears as a separate word preceding the verb or other elements of the clause.

Additionally, Paragraph 9 provides examples such as ""(6-132) marlami wardbi not he:will:go 'He can't walk.'"" and ""(6-133) marlami wardjiddi not we:went 'We didn't go.'"" which further illustrate that negation is achieved through the use of separate particles rather than affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

Given this consistent description and usage, it is clear that standard negation in Gooniyandi is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, it is possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the normal way of forming a negative in Modern Tiwi (MT) is by inserting the negative particle ""kalu (wu)"" or ""anuka."" These particles are used more often than the traditional form ""arnuka."" The examples provided show the negative particle occurring before the verb or verbal complex, but there is no indication of these particles being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates the use of negative particles ""anuka"" and ""karluwu"" in Traditional Tiwi (TT), which occur immediately before the verb or verbal complex. Again, there is no indication that these particles are phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the use of mood prefixes and mentions that in MT, the negative is simply marked by the negative particle ""kaluwu"" or ""anuka"" and a verbal form that is the same as the indicative. This suggests that the negation is not marked by an affix or clitic bound to the verb but rather by a separate particle.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of the negative imperative using the negative particle ""ngajiti"" or its variants. These particles are used with a free form verb, indicating that the negation is not bound to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of prepositional phrases and other grammatical elements but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

6. **Paragraph 6** mentions the use of negative pronouns formed by prefixing ""karri"" to interrogative forms, but this is not directly related to the standard negation of dynamic verbal predicates.

7. **Paragraph 7** provides an example of the negative particle ""anuka"" used before a verb, reinforcing the pattern of using separate particles for negation.

8. **Paragraph 8** discusses various grammatical elements but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses voice suffixes and aspect affixes but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses temporal constituents and modal particles but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

11. **Paragraph 11** discusses coordinate NPs and appositional noun phrases but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

12. **Paragraph 12** discusses adjectival qualities and other word classes but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses the irrealis mood and frustrative mood but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

14. **Paragraph 14** discusses the structure of clauses and sentences but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

15. **Paragraph 15** discusses ditransitive clauses and prepositional phrases but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

16. **Paragraph 16** discusses interrogative sentences and tag questions but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses arguments of the clause in Traditional Tiwi but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

18. **Paragraph 18** discusses stative verbal clauses but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

19. **Paragraph 19** discusses various grammatical elements but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

20. **Paragraph 20** discusses clause types in Traditional Tiwi but does not provide relevant information about the method of negation.

From the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tiwi is marked by separate particles (e.g., ""kalu,"" ""anuka,"" ""ngajiti"") that are not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Tiwi cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Nakkara,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language Nakkara. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the negative particle ""korla"" precedes the verb in negative constructions.
2. **Paragraph 3** describes the use of the negative affix ""-ma"" which follows the verb stem in the tense suffix slot of the verb complex.
3. **Paragraph 13** provides examples of negative constructions where ""korla"" is used along with the verb forms, and the negative affix ""-ma"" is attached to the verb stem.
4. **Paragraph 15** outlines the structure of negative verb forms, indicating the presence of a negative prefix /ka/ and a negative suffix /-ma/ in the verb complex.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Nakkara involves both a negative particle ""korla"" and a negative affix ""-ma"" that attaches to the verb. The negative affix ""-ma"" is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through an affix or modification of the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negative particle ""korla"" precedes the verb, but crucially, the negative affix ""-ma"" is attached directly to the verb stem, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.
- The presence of the negative affix ""-ma"" in the verb complex (as described in Paragraphs 3 and 13) confirms that negation is marked on the verb itself.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Garrwa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, paragraph 2 mentions that in negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form with the suffix -kanyi. This is a clear indication that negation involves a morphological change to the verb. Additionally, paragraph 7 provides examples of verbs in irrealis form (e.g., ""jilaj-kanyi"" for 'walk-irr' in ""miku ngayu jilaj-kanyi"" meaning 'I’m not going'), further supporting the presence of verb modification in negation. Moreover, paragraph 7 also mentions the use of the clitic =yanyi for past negation, as in ""miku yali=yanyi daba"" meaning 'They didn’t kill it'. This indicates that clitics are also used in the negation process.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ngankikurungkurr,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr. Here is the relevant information extracted:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""the negative particle minbe/minde(K) frequently attracts such verbal enclitics as the temporal focus marker -nyine/-kana(K) and the past and future tense markers, -tye and -pe/ -ngini(K)."" This indicates that the negative particle can host verbal enclitics, suggesting a close phonological relationship between the negation and the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6** describes prohibitives structured with the pre-verbal negative particle minbe/minde(K) and mentions that prohibitives differ from negative imperatives by appealing to authority. This implies that the negative particle is used in standard negation.

3. **Paragraph 13** provides examples of the negative particle minbe- suffixed with generics, such as ""minbe-yenggi"" (Neg-fire) and ""minbe-yawurr"" (Neg-tree), indicating that the negative particle can combine with other elements to form a phonological unit.

From these points, it is clear that the negative particle minbe/minde(K) can attract verbal enclitics and form a phonological unit with the verb, indicating that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The negative particle minbe/minde(K) can host verbal enclitics, forming a phonological unit with the verb.
- The examples provided show that the negative particle can combine with other elements, including verbs, to form a single phonological unit.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wagiman,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Wagiman can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3 provides examples of the negator ""wudyi"" being used in conjunction with verbs to negate the proposition expressed in the clause. The negator ""wudyi"" appears in clause-initial position, but it is used in conjunction with the verb forms to express negation, as seen in examples like:

- ""wudyiga-ya'ganq-maga'anlagiban"" (NEG 3sg:IPFV-tell 1sg OBL-FOC that mang-~a-ggi 3sg:PFV-go-PAST) meaning 'He didn't tell me anything but just sneaked off.'
- ""wudyigety"" (NEG ask-PCT 3sg/lsg-put-PPCT food-DAT) meaning 'He didn't ask me for food.'

These examples indicate that the negation involves a specific negator that interacts with the verb forms to express negation, suggesting a bound relationship between the negator and the verb.

Additionally, Paragraph 10 provides further evidence with examples of negation in imperative forms using ""dyamba"" (IRR NEG), which is used in conjunction with verbs to form negative commands:

- ""dyambagi-ya"" (IRR NEG 2sg:IPFV-go) meaning 'Don't mess around!'
- ""dyamba mi-ya-qga"" (IRR NEG 2sg:POT-go-away) meaning 'Don't go away!'

These examples show that negation in Wagiman can be marked by a specific negator that is bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) by examining the specific examples and descriptions of negation in the language. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The particle ""la"" is used for negation and can combine with pre-verbal particles like ""i-"" and ""q6m-"".
   - Examples show the negator ""la"" combining with verbs, sometimes resulting in phonetic changes (e.g., ""le-y-pal6†"", ""l5-pal6†"").
   - The negator ""la"" is prefixed to the verb, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb.
   - Examples include: ""le-y-mbáqri"" (do not ask), ""le-y-mabyênwa"" (did not show), ""le-y-máxi"" (do not put), ""l5-xàru"" (does not go off), ""míya l7-ßale"" (water does not flow), ""l7-q5mi"" (do not grow), ""là-y-awra"" (will not enter), ""là-y-asq6n"" (shall not go up), ""l7-y-ax6l"" (will not eat), ""le-y-áxl6x"" (do not eat), ""le-y-""amrènne"" (shall not tell), ""lá q6m-qa†èlla"" (did not kill), ""lá q6m-xazìle"" (did not see), ""lá q6m-basmále"" (did not please).

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The negative particle ""la"" is used before verbs in various contexts, including coordinated series of negated verbal predicates.
   - Examples include: ""lànwa wíða"" (have not done), ""lá-b>y6x la-mìya"" (do not want water), ""là-dwaqa"" (not to gather water).

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - The negative particle ""la"" is used before verbs and other constituents.
   - Examples include: ""là-b5°a qíða"" (house had not burnt down), ""là-kulley yapáwa"" (not all of them used to bake), ""là gu-""Ôn6 Núne"" (did not spend the festival), ""là raba-""i-map6lxêxwala"" (do not use it much).

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - The negative particle ""la"" is used in negated interrogative clauses.
   - Examples include: ""l7la dmìxe"" (while they were asleep), ""lá y-ßal•xwa"" (when we went down), ""lá m>y•xwa"" (when we shook), ""la-°éle"" (when the beginning of the fast came), ""l7le mútt6lla"" (when he placed his foot).

From these examples, it is clear that the negator ""la"" is consistently prefixed to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This indicates that standard negation in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
English,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in English can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 17 provides clear examples of synthetic primary negation, where the negation is marked by the negative present tense form of the auxiliary verb, such as ""won’t"" (a contraction of ""will not"") and ""didn’t"" (a contraction of ""did not""). These forms are synthetic because they combine the auxiliary verb with the negation marker into a single phonological unit.

For instance:
- ""Kim will not be here later on."" (analytic primary negation)
- ""Kim won’t be here later on."" (synthetic primary negation)

Similarly, for lexical verbs:
- ""Kim did not wave to us."" (analytic primary negation)
- ""Kim didn’t wave to us."" (synthetic primary negation)

These examples show that the negation marker can be phonologically bound to the verb, either as a contraction (clitic) or as a modification of the verb form.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Korean,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korean can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points from the paragraphs that support this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the short negative form ""ani"" and the strong negative form ""mos"" which are used to negate verbs.
- Paragraph 2 explains that the short negative ""ani"" and the strong negative ""mos"" are found in early texts and are used to negate the verb phrase.
- Paragraph 4 provides examples of the short negative ""ani"" being used directly with verbs, such as ""an mikkulepta"" (is not slippery) and ""an coh.ta"" (is not good).
- Paragraph 5 discusses the use of negative adverbs ""ani"" and ""mos"" which are placed before the verb to negate it.
- Paragraph 6 mentions the use of ""an"" and ""mos"" in negative sentences, indicating that these forms are used directly with verbs.
- Paragraph 11 discusses the placement of ""mos"" between the verbal noun and the postnominal verb, indicating that ""mos"" is phonologically bound to the verb in certain constructions.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Korean involves the use of negative markers that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as affixes or clitics.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Basque,"Based on the given paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Basque can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of negation in Basque where the negative particle ""ez"" is used in conjunction with the auxiliary verb:
   - (1072) a. Ez da inor etorri.
     - not AUX anybody come
     - 'Nobody came.'
   - b. Ez du inork erosi.
     - not AUX anybody.ERG buy
     - 'Nobody bought it.'

   In these examples, ""ez"" is a negative particle that precedes the auxiliary verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This indicates that the negation is marked by a modification involving the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6** also supports this by showing the use of ""ez"" with the auxiliary verb in negative clauses:
   - (82) a. Ez dugu/daukagu ogi-rik.
     - not have bread.PRTT
     - 'We don't have any bread.'
   - (83) b. Gaur ez da hemen ume-rik jaio.
     - today not AUX here baby.PRTT be.born
     - 'No baby has been born here today.'

   Again, ""ez"" is used with the auxiliary verb, indicating that the negation is marked by a modification involving the verb.

3. **Paragraph 10** mentions that in Eastern dialects, the negative element appears joined with the participle:
   - (995) Nork du liburua ez irakurri?
     - who.ERG AUX book not read
     - 'Who hasn't read the book?'

   This example shows that the negative element ""ez"" is joined with the participle, further indicating that negation can be marked by a modification involving the verb.

Given these examples, it is clear that standard negation in Basque involves a negative particle ""ez"" that is phonologically bound to the auxiliary verb, thus marking negation through a modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Malayalam,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 12 states, ""Negative is formed by the addition of ie§y after the tense marker. When it is added the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero."" This indicates that a negative marker is added to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Additionally, Paragraph 15 mentions, ""Negative verbal adjectives are formed by the addition of —(3Ta>roro> to the verb-stem,"" which further supports the presence of affixation for negation.

Given these descriptions, it is clear that negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the standard negation in Mien:

1. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 4** state that negation is marked by the particle ""maiv"" /mai˦˥˧/ or its contracted form ""mv"" /m̩ ˦˥˧/, which is placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs. This indicates that negation is achieved through a particle that precedes the verb rather than through an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

2. **Paragraph 10** mentions that both the full form ""maiv"" and the contracted form ""mv"" can occur in one sentence in three ways, but it does not indicate that these forms are affixes or clitics bound to the verb. Instead, they are particles that precede the verbs.

3. **Paragraph 17** further supports this by stating that verbs and adjectival verbs can immediately be preceded by the negative particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv"". This reinforces the understanding that negation is marked by a separate particle rather than an affix or clitic.

4. **Paragraph 18** provides an example where the negative particle ""mv"" is used before verbs, but again, it is not indicated as being bound to the verb.

From the information provided, it is clear that negation in Mien is marked by a particle that precedes the verb. There is no evidence in the given paragraphs to suggest that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Conclusion: 0**

Reasoning: The negation in Mien is marked by a particle that precedes the verb, and there is no indication that this particle is an affix, clitic, or involves modification of the verb.",0,0
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the standard negation in Semelai is marked by the particle ""da?"" which is not phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs do not provide any evidence of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Describes the use of the external negator ""beh"" along with an internally negated clause using ""da?"".
2. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of ""beh"" used with negated verbal clauses, where ""da?"" is the internal negator.
3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the use of ""beh"" and ""da?"" in negation, indicating that ""da?"" is used for internal negation.
4. **Paragraph 7**: Differentiates between internal negation with ""da?"" and external negation with ""beh"".
5. **Paragraph 9**: Lists the basic negative operators in Semelai, including ""da?"" for propositional negation.

None of these paragraphs indicate that ""da?"" or any other negation marker is an affix, clitic, or involves modification of the verb. Instead, ""da?"" appears to function as a separate particle.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yukaghir (Kolyma) can be marked by a prefix attached to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 states: ""The standard sentential negation is expressed by attaching the prefix e/+ to the finite verb, as illustrated by (857) and many other examples in this grammar (see also 6.1.1.3.1)."" This indicates that the negation marker forms a phonological unit with the verb, qualifying it as an affix.

Examples provided in the paragraphs, such as:
- (857)a. tamun-gemet-kele el+jan-ni that-LOC -FACC NEG+send-3PL:INTR ‘They did not let me go there’,
- (866)a. met [my and’e eye el+jud-je NEG+see-ATTR] mieste-get place-ABL kudede-k kill-Imp:2se ‘Kill them somewhere where I will not see it.’,

further support the presence of a negative prefix that attaches directly to the verb.

Georgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs describe the use of the negative particle ""ar"" which is used in association with verbs to form negative constructions. For example, in paragraph 1, it is mentioned that ""Past statements which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive switch to the Perfect when negated by ar."" This indicates that the verb form changes when negated, which is a modification of the verb. Additionally, the use of ""ar"" directly with verbs (as seen in the examples) shows that it is phonologically bound to the verb, functioning similarly to an affix or clitic.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Alutor,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Alutor can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of the negative particle ""ally"" in combination with the verb forms, indicating that negation can be marked on the verb. For instance, the example ""...I didn't see (them)"" uses ""ally"" with the verb form ""nota-la@u-ka"".

2. **Paragraph 4** details various methods of verbal negation, including:
   - Combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb.
   - Combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka).
   - Combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from the deverbal predicative.
   - The analytical form derived from the negative analytical representation (nuN-...-a/-ta).
   - Circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in.

   These methods indicate that negation can involve affixes or circumfixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of circumfixes used for negation, such as tymNi-...-a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in, which are clearly affixes that attach to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 6** mentions the use of the negative analytical representation (nuN-...-a/-ta) in combination with the verb, further supporting the presence of affixation in negation.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Alutor can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Thai. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 3**: ""Another common way of rendering 'Yes' or 'No' in answering a question is merely to repeat the verb on its own for the affirmative or the verb preceded by the negative word MY for the negative.""
   - Example: ""YOO KA"" (Yes, he is in) vs. ""MY YOO KA"" (No, he is not in).

2. **Paragraph 5**: ""When DY is used with the negative word MY the meaning is again dependent on the position with relation to the verb. MY DY placed in front of the verb means 'did not' and this construction is very widely used.""
   - Example: ""CHUN MY DY PY"" (I did not go).

3. **Paragraph 8**: ""A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of the verb or, in certain cases, after it.""
   - Example: ""CHUN PY MY DY"" (I cannot go).

From these examples, it is clear that the negation in Thai is achieved by placing the negative particle ""MY"" before the verb. The negative particle ""MY"" is not an affix or clitic; it is a separate word that precedes the verb. There is no indication of the negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Reasoning:
- The negation is consistently described as involving the particle ""MY"" placed before the verb.
- There is no mention of any affixation, cliticization, or modification of the verb itself to indicate negation.
- The negative particle ""MY"" is a separate word and not phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Nganasan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nganasan can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative auxiliary ""ńisɨ"" is used in standard negation, which is an auxiliary verb that carries tense and mood markers and agrees with the subject in person and number. The main verb in the negative phrase takes the connegative marker ""-ʔ"". This indicates that the negation is phonologically bound to the verb through the use of the negative auxiliary and the connegative form of the main verb.

For example:
- ""ńi-sɨə-mə miďə-Ɂ"" (neg.aux-pst-1sg.obc give-cng) translates to ""I did not give.""
- ""ńi-sɨðə-ŋ maa-gəlʲičǝ kuniɁi͡ai-gəlʲičǝ mɨǝ-Ɂ"" (neg.aux-fut-2sg what-emph how-emph do-cng) translates to ""You will not do anything.""

These examples demonstrate that the negative auxiliary ""ńisɨ"" and the connegative marker ""-ʔ"" are used to form a phonological unit with the verb, thereby marking standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that affixes such as negation may occupy various positions in a verb form depending on their scope.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** discusses the negational suffix in Japanese and mentions that in Nivkh, the greatest formal change has occurred in the negative experiential and negative habitual marker -yzu-, which has become bound in comparison to its source verb.

3. **Paragraph 4** provides a table listing various negation forms in Nivkh, including -ʁavr-, -lәyә-, and -yzu- as negative markers.

4. **Paragraph 10** describes the modal verb construction in Nivkh, stating that negative modality and negation itself in the Amur variety are formed ad hoc and that the modal verbs take the position of the second root. The modals listed include -ʁavr-, -ləyə-, -yzu-, -molo-, -jiki-, -iruţez-, and -ilskr-.

5. **Paragraph 19** mentions that the supine form combined with qauḑ ""sth. does not exist"" or verb root serialization with lәyәḑ ""s.o. lacks sth."" can be used for negation.

From these points, it is clear that Nivkh (South Sakhalin) uses bound morphemes (affixes) for marking negation. Specifically, the negative markers -ʁavr-, -lәyә-, and -yzu- are affixes that attach to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jarawa (in Andamans),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, it is evident that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of the suffix {-ma} for negation: ""The suffix {-ma} can be used instead of naɖem.""
2. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states: ""Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: either putting a negative word at the end of a clause, or using a negative suffix to the verbs.""
3. **Paragraph 5** reiterates: ""Negation in Jarawa can be expressed in two ways: either by using the independent negative word naɖem or the suffix –ma.""
4. **Paragraph 6** provides an example of the negative suffix {-ma} being used on a verb: ""uʈʰa allema-ma Uʈʰa come-NEG Uʈʰa did not come.""
5. **Paragraph 9** also demonstrates the use of the negative suffix {-ma} in prohibitives: ""ullel ɖəbəᵼʈʰe-ma seago-NEG LOC Don’t go in the sea.""

These paragraphs collectively confirm that standard negation in Jarawa can indeed be marked by an affix (the suffix {-ma}) that attaches to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nahali,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Nahali can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Affixation and Cliticization**: Paragraph 1 mentions that negation can be marked by forms such as ""ho:to"" which can occur preceding or following the verb (e.g., ""ho:to-kappo"" for 'does not/did not sleep'). Paragraph 4 further elaborates that ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:ṭo"" are used as negative markers, with ""beṭhe"" used in non-past constructions and ""ho:ṭo"" in past tense constructions. These markers can precede or follow the verb, and sometimes undergo assimilation with the following verb (e.g., ""beṭhe"" > ""bep-"" in ""beppa:ṭo"").

- **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 4 also describes how the negative marker ""beṭhe"" can undergo phonological changes when it precedes the verb, indicating a modification of the verb form itself (e.g., ""beṭhe"" > ""bem-"" in ""bemma:nḍi"").

- **Bound Morphemes**: Paragraph 6 provides examples of how negative markers are integrated into the verb structure, such as ""jo beṭhe kappoka"" (I do not sleep) and ""jo ho:to kappo"" (I did not sleep), indicating that these negative markers are phonologically bound to the verb.

Given these points, it is evident that standard negation in Nahali involves affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb, fulfilling the criteria for a 1.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Kusunda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kusunda, it is evident that standard negation in Kusunda can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that negative realis-assertion in Class II verbs is marked by a suffix -aÚu.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negative realis forms in Class II verbs, such as ""e-d-a u"" for ""I did not give"" and ""e-n-a u"" for ""you did not give.""
- Paragraph 4 discusses negative irrealis-assertion marked by a suffix -wa.
- Paragraph 5 describes the use of mutation and the suffix -u in marking negative realis in mutating verbs.
- Paragraph 7 shows examples of negative forms like ""t -aÚ -u"" for ""I did not go.""

These examples clearly show that negation in Kusunda involves suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Udihe,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Udihe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the negative conjugation in Udihe, which is periphrastic and involves the negative auxiliary verb ""e(i)-"". The negative verb ""e-"" appears in a morphological form that reflects the role of the predicate in the sentence. This indicates that the negative auxiliary verb is phonologically bound to the content verb, forming a unit with it.

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph further clarifies that negation in Udihe is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb ""e-/ei-"", which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms. Examples provided include ""e-si-ti etete-du"" (NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL) and ""e-s'e-li etete"" (NEG-PERF-CC.SS work), showing that the negative auxiliary verb is indeed bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph confirms that negation in subordinate clauses is organized in the same way as in main clauses, with the negative verb in the corresponding morphological form and the bare stem of the content verb. This consistency across different clause types supports the conclusion that the negative verb is phonologically bound to the content verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Udihe involves a negative auxiliary verb that is phonologically bound to the content verb, either as an affix or a clitic.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ingush,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingush can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** states that ""Negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush.""
- **Paragraph 2** elaborates that ""The negative morpheme is either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form: suffix for tense forms, proclitic cy for converbs and nonfinites, proclitic my for imperatives.""
- **Paragraph 5** confirms that ""Negation, not shown in (1), is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic elsewhere.""
- **Paragraph 9** provides detailed examples of suffixal negation for finite verbs and proclitic negation for nonfinite forms, converbs, and imperatives.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that negation in Ingush involves suffixes and proclitics that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Lezgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Lezgian can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions that finite indicative verb forms are negated by means of the suffix -δ (e.g., guzwa 'gives', guzwa-δ 'does not give'). This indicates that the negation is achieved through a suffix attached to the verb, which is a form of affixation.

Additionally, Paragraph 3 confirms this by stating that verbs are negated by the negative suffix -δ or by the negative prefix tA-. This further supports the presence of affixation in marking standard negation.

Paragraph 14 also provides an overview of verbal inflectional categories, showing that indicative forms are negated by the suffix -δ following the aspect suffix. This consistent use of suffixes for negation across different verb forms reinforces the conclusion that standard negation in Lezgian involves affixation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Galo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, it is clear that standard negation in Galo can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negation suffix -máa is used to mark negative polarity on the verb. This is evident from several examples and explanations provided in the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 explicitly states that ""Final predicates in negative polarity are obligatorily suffixed in -máa"" and provides examples such as ""kəbə̀ káa-máa"" ('have/exist-NEG') and ""cèn-máa-rə́"" ('know-NEG-IRR').
- Paragraph 2 includes the example ""cèn-tà≡(ə)i≡kú-máa"" ('know-INCP≡EMPH≡CMPL-NEG'), further illustrating the use of the -máa suffix for negation.
- Paragraph 4 mentions that ""Appositive clauses make use of two negators máa and móo,"" with máa being homophonous with the negative predicate inflection -máa.
- Paragraph 10 provides another example of the use of -máa in the sentence ""mə́ə-pàa-kú-dáa-máa"" ('think-ATTN-CMPL-ACHV-NEG').

These examples and explanations confirm that the negation marker -máa is an affix that attaches to the verb, thereby forming a phonological unit with the verbal root.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly mention the use of suffixes to indicate negation. For instance, Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the suppletive negative participle ""-nguq"" and the negative participle ""-ksait-"". Paragraph 3 provides examples of the suffix ""-nrit-"" used for negation. Paragraph 4 lists various negative suffixes such as ""-nћլit-"" (not), ""-at-"" (not), and ""-ksait-"" (not yet). Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 8 further reinforce the use of negative suffixes in different moods and contexts. These examples clearly show that negation is marked directly on the verb through affixation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuki,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuki can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The primary method for negation in Yuki involves the suffixation of the negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb, as seen in multiple examples such as ""luh-tl-ṭan-paˀ"" (chop-TR-NEG-FUT) meaning ‘You’re not going to chop wood’. Additionally, there is mention of a negative verb ṭal-, which can also be used to form negative clauses, though its use is less common and not fully understood. The presence of the negative suffix -ṭan directly attached to the verb root in various examples confirms that negation is marked by an affix.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Pipil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Pipil can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 provides examples of negative imperatives where the negation is marked by the particle ""te:"" or ""ma:"" combined with the imperative prefix ""xi-"". For instance, ""te: xi-yu"" (don't go!) and ""te: xi-k-kwa-kan"" (don't eat it (you pl.)) show that the negation particle ""te:"" is used in conjunction with the imperative prefix ""xi-"". This indicates that negation is indeed marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Paragraph 5 also mentions that negative imperatives are formed with ""te:"" or ""ma:/maka"" plus the ""xi-"" imperative prefix, which further supports the conclusion that negation involves a modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language Micmac. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides crucial information about the negative forms of intransitive verbs in Micmac. It states that the negative morpheme is ""-w-"" (or [G]), which appears within the verb structure. Specifically, it follows the dual or plural number morpheme and precedes the person markers. This indicates that the negative morpheme is an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. The structure described in Paragraph 2, where the negative morpheme is inserted within the verb, clearly shows that the negation is marked by an affix. The examples provided, such as ""welagapiwun"" and ""welagapiweg,"" illustrate the insertion of the negative morpheme within the verb form.

3. **Paragraph 10** further supports this by discussing the derivation of negative forms from the verb stem, indicating that the negative morpheme is integrated into the verb morphology.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Micmac can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) is marked by the negative particle ""jaantu"" or its truncated form ""tuu."" This particle precedes the verb or the verb phrase, as seen in multiple examples throughout the text. There is no indication that the negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negative particle ""jaantu"" operates independently and is not phonologically bound to the verb. 

For instance:
- ""jaantu klakask'in"" (NEG 1SUB-want(IMPFV)) translates to ""I don’t want you to sing.""
- ""jaantu k'atza-y"" (NEG know-IMPFV) translates to ""He doesn’t know if she has the money.""
- ""jaantu saa-y"" (NEG play-IMPFV) translates to ""Juan does not play the guitar.""

These examples consistently show the negative particle ""jaantu"" preceding the verb without any morphological changes to the verb itself.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is evidence suggesting that standard negation in Musqueam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 7 mentions negative past habitual forms such as ""?ewe-2-4.4, ?ew-E2-4,4, ?eaw-e-4,4-2"" and negative past interrogative forms like ""?ew-€-2-4,.4"". These forms indicate that negation can be marked by affixes attached to the verb.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides examples of negative past habitual and negative past interrogative forms, which include affixes such as ""?ewe-"", ""?ew-"", and ""?eaw-"". These affixes are attached to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by affixation.
2. **Affixation**: The presence of these affixes directly on the verb forms suggests that negation is achieved through morphological modification of the verb, which aligns with the criteria for marking standard negation.

### Conclusion:
1",0,1
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Omaha can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that to negate a verb, a negating particle is added after it, and this particle is itself conjugated. This suggests that the negating particle is closely associated with the verb, potentially forming a phonological unit with it.

2. **Paragraph 5** describes how in commands, a preceding -e verb ablauts to -a before the negating particle azhi. This indicates that the negating particle causes a phonological change in the verb, which is a form of modification.

3. **Paragraph 9** further supports this by stating that all versions of the negating particle allow a preceding -e verb to ablaut to -a when describing someone’s past action. This consistent pattern of ablaut before the negating particle shows that the negation process involves a modification of the verb.

4. **Paragraph 10** explicitly states that when azhi is used, it combines tightly with the preceding verb, indicating that the negating particle forms a phonological unit with the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Omaha involves either a modification of the verb or the use of a negating particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the relevant information to determine if standard negation in Washo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Analysis of Paragraphs

**Paragraph 2:**
- Mentions ""Negative; stem—initial,"" which suggests that there is a negative marker that attaches to the verb stem. This implies that negation could be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Paragraph 4:**
- States ""-é°s Negative,"" indicating that there is a specific negative suffix used in the language. This suffix is likely to be attached to the verb, marking negation directly on the verb.

**Paragraph 5:**
- Discusses affixed verbs and mentions that affixes apply to verbs. This supports the idea that negation could be marked by an affix on the verb.

### Reasoning

From the information provided:
- Paragraph 2 suggests that negation involves a marker that attaches to the verb stem.
- Paragraph 4 explicitly mentions a negative suffix ""-é°s,"" indicating that negation is marked by an affix.
- Paragraph 5 supports the presence of affixes on verbs, which could include negative markers.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Washo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Koasati,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Koasati can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 4 mentions ""The negative subject cross-reference suffixes are of interest,"" indicating that negation is marked by suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 6 states, ""All negative markers in Koasati are portmanteau morphemes indicating both person and negation and cannot be decomposed synchronically,"" further supporting that negation is integrated into the verb morphology. Paragraph 16 also supports this by stating, ""Second, the fact that, in the negative forms, only the negative marker bears an accent indicates that the marker and the verb root form a unit,"" which confirms that the negative marker is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Chumash (Barbareño),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Chumash (Barbareño) can be marked by an affix. Specifically, the negative prefix e- is mentioned multiple times as a means of marking negation. For instance, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative prefix e- in the context of adverbial clauses, and Paragraph 12 explicitly states that ""negation in Barbareno Chumash always appears in the form of the prefix -e-."" This prefix is phonologically bound to the verb, as it directly attaches to the verb stem to indicate negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions that when Yes/No questions are negative, the question post-clitic is almost always attached to the negative pre-clitic. This indicates that the negative marker is a pre-clitic that attaches to the verb phrase.
   
2. **Paragraph 10** provides an example of the negative pre-clitic nC- being used with the verb phrase and auxiliary re to form the negative ability 'can't'. This further supports that the negative marker is a pre-clitic attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 12** explicitly states that the negative pre-clitic ni- can be attached to the verb or a noun, and when attached to the verb, it has scope over the verb and therefore the sentence. This confirms that the negative marker is a clitic that attaches to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 13** gives examples of the negative pre-clitic ne- attached to verbs and nouns, showing its role in negation within the sentence structure.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the information to determine if standard negation in Alsea can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Paragraph 1:
This paragraph is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information about the negation method.

Paragraph 2:
This paragraph mentions that the negative particle must precede the verb, but it does not specify if this particle is phonologically bound to the verb or if it is a separate word.

Paragraph 4:
This paragraph mentions the absence of the particle of negation in a specific context but does not provide details on how negation is generally marked.

Paragraph 7:
This paragraph mentions a ""particle of negation"" but does not specify if it is an affix, clitic, or a separate word.

Paragraph 11:
This paragraph discusses the amalgamation of subjective pronouns and suffixed particles but does not provide specific information about negation.

Paragraph 12:
This paragraph mentions suffixed particles but does not specify if any of these are used for negation.

Given the information from the paragraphs, there is no clear evidence that standard negation in Alsea is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The references to negation particles do not clarify whether these particles are phonologically bound to the verb or not.

**Reasoning:**
The provided paragraphs do not offer conclusive evidence that standard negation in Alsea is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The references to negation particles are not specific enough to determine their phonological status relative to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0

```

From this paragraph, we observe that the negative forms of verbs in Arikara are consistently marked with the prefix ""kaakA-"" (or similar variations like ""kaaka-"", ""kaakAx-"", etc.). This prefix is attached directly to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb through affixation.

**Paragraph 6:**
```
A process which refers tu grammatical additions to
the verb or noun.
In verbs these changes are made by
the addition of affixes that indicate number, person,
tense, mode, etc.
```

This paragraph confirms that grammatical changes, including negation, are made by adding affixes to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Arikara can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Takelma. The key information is found in Paragraph 12:

> ""An indicative non-future statement, such as is expressed by the aorist, is negatived, without change of the verb-form, by means of the negative adverb a’ni*:
> yant'e® I went; a’ni* yant‘e® I did not go
> An imperative or future form, however, can not be directly negatived, it must be expressed by the potential and inferential respectively, the non-aoristic negative adverb wede being prefixed.
> Negative future:
> wede yana‘k‘ he will not go
> wede yana’k!ett' you will not go: wede yana’k‘a‘ I shall not go
> Negative imperative:
> wede yana‘t' do not go!""

From this paragraph, we can see that standard negation in Takelma involves the use of negative adverbs ""a’ni*"" and ""wede"". These negative markers are not affixes or clitics bound to the verb but are separate words (adverbs) that precede the verb. Therefore, they do not form a phonological unit with the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Takelma is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Conclusion: 0",0,0
Jemez,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Jemez by examining the relevant information about how negation is marked in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions a ""negative prefix /W&/"" as part of the verb structure. This indicates that negation can be marked by a prefix that attaches to the verb, making it phonologically bound.

2. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negative imperative constructions using the morpheme /m@/ ('no, without, out of'), which is suffixed to nouns and verbs. This suggests that negation can also be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 15** includes an example where the negative prefix /wf/ intervenes between parts of the pronominal prefix, indicating that the prefix is indeed bound to the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix (prefix or suffix) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Zuni can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of negation in Zuni, showing the use of a negative verb stem suffix. For instance, in the sentence ""k¥a'pimc'ananeg.piglet‘itok'ya-nam-kya"" (He didn't feed the piglet), the suffix ""-nam"" is used to mark negation on the verb ""‘itok'ya"" (feed).

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""Two elements are required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, a negative particle and a negative verb stem suffix."" This indicates that negation involves a suffix attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph further supports the use of a suffix in negation, showing the presence of ""-k-"" in the negative form of the eventive intransitive verb.

4. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides additional examples of negation with a suffix. For example, ""k¥a'‘okyaccik'te'le’k'oSo-nam-kya"" (The woman didn't wash the pot) uses the suffix ""-nam"" to indicate negation.

Given these examples and descriptions, it is clear that Zuni uses a negative verb stem suffix to mark standard negation, which is a phonologically bound morpheme.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Rama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides an example where the negation particle ""aa"" is used in the sentence ""yaing tiiskama skuu ~- ki aa y-aalu-iikr-i"" which is glossed as ""3POSS child school-PSP/to NEG 3-send-want-TNS"" meaning ""she doesn't want to send her child to school."" Here, ""aa"" is used as a negation particle that appears to be phonologically bound to the verb phrase.

2. **Paragraph 4** states that the negation particle ""aa"" is prefixed to the verb in a preverbal position, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. This is evident in the example ""nah rama aa alkwis-i"" glossed as ""1 Rama NEG speak-TNS"" meaning ""I don't speak Rama.""

3. **Paragraph 7** mentions that the negation markers ""aa"" and ""taama/tahma"" can be used interchangeably and provides examples where these markers are used in subordinate clauses and with the progressive aspect. For instance, ""nah-uy-uliin-inahyu-alkwis-taama-ka"" glossed as ""1-PSP/with 3-vex-TNS 1 RP/with-talk-NEG-SUB"" meaning ""she gets angry with me when I don't talk with her.""

4. **Paragraph 14** discusses the use of the negative particle ""taama/tahma"" with verbs, showing examples like ""wark-i-ting-tahma-u"" glossed as ""work-3-do-NEG-TNS"" meaning ""he never worked."" This indicates that ""tahma"" is used as a suffix to mark negation on the verb.

5. **Paragraph 20** provides an example of a negative existential construction ""naas nganguk aa kwaakar"" glossed as ""NEG have money 1"" meaning ""I have no money,"" where ""aa"" is used as a negation particle bound to the verb.

From these examples, it is clear that negation in Rama can be marked by particles such as ""aa"" and ""taama/tahma"" that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as prefixes or suffixes.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tonkawa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tonkawa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 explicitly mentions the use of the negative suffix ""-abe-"" which is added directly to the verb theme to form the negative of any verb. This suffix is clearly an affix as it attaches directly to the verb and modifies its meaning to express negation.

For example:
- ""yagb-ab-o'c"" (I do not hit him)
- ""geigab-ab-o'"" (he does not hit me)
- ""yagb-abe-no'c"" (I am not hitting him)
- ""yagb-abe-nec'o'c"" (we two do not hit him)

These examples demonstrate that the negative suffix ""-abe-"" is used directly with the verb themes to indicate negation, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Tunica can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative postfix -?aha, which is added to the positive forms of verbs to create negative forms. This indicates that negation is achieved through a postfix, which is an affix that attaches to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of how the negative postfix -?aha and -k?aha are used with verbs. For instance, ""hopt'wik?aha"" (he should not come out) and ""ya'kawcehe'nt"" (he did not come back) show that these negative markers are indeed affixes attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4** further supports this by showing examples like ""haka'liwik?aha'ni"" (he would not stop) and ""?0'rus?aha'ni"" (he did not know), where the negative postfixes -?aha and -k?aha are clearly attached to the verbs.

4. **Paragraph 5** confirms that the negative inchoative forms are constructed similarly to the negative forms of active verbs, again using the postfix -?aha.

5. **Paragraph 15** explicitly states that the negative paradigms of active verbs are formed by means of the negative postfixes -aha and -k?aha, and provides examples like ""lo’tawehe"" (he did not run) and ""lo’tawik?aha"" (he does not run), showing the postfixes attached to the verbs.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Tunica can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Wappo,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Wappo as follows:

1. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph is the most relevant as it directly addresses the formation of the negative. It states that negation is regularly formed by the postposition of ""la'ki,"" which is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix of unknown force. It also mentions that ""la'ki"" affects the preceding verb-stem similarly to subordinating suffixes, often causing them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This suggests that the negation marker ""la'ki"" has a phonological impact on the verb, indicating a close phonological relationship.

2. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph provides an example where ""laki"" is used as a negative adverb. It states that ""laki"" is a negative adverb and provides an example sentence where it is used. This supports the idea that ""laki"" is indeed a bound morpheme affecting the verb.

3. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the fusion of suffixes with the original verb-stem, indicating that suffixes in Wappo can be tightly bound to the verb. This supports the idea that ""la'ki"" could be functioning similarly as a bound suffix.

4. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the structure of verb-stems in Wappo, mentioning that verb-stems often appear with detachable prefixes and suffixes, which can include tense, aspect, and modal suffixes. This further supports the idea that negation could be marked by a bound morpheme.

### Conclusion: 1

Given the information, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Wappo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence from Paragraph 4, supported by additional context from Paragraphs 15, 18, and 19, indicates that the negation marker ""la'ki"" is phonologically bound to the verb and affects its form. Therefore, the correct option is 1.",1,1
Ute,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Ute employs various methods for marking negation that involve modifications of the verb or the addition of affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the use of negative participles and suffixes such as -ait-ϊ-, -p'i'ai-, -a-'q-u-, and -n a'ai- that attach to verbs to indicate negation. These forms are clearly bound to the verb and modify its meaning to express negation.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that verbs can be provided with a negative suffix or a negative modification of a verbalizing suffix. Examples include the suffixes -apa-, -ywa'ai-, and -rjwa'ai-, which are used to negate verbs and are phonologically bound to them.

- **Paragraph 5**: Explicitly states ""NEGATION"" and provides examples of negative forms that include bound morphemes attached to verbs.

The evidence from these paragraphs indicates that Ute uses affixes and modifications directly on the verb to mark standard negation. Therefore, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Ute can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Yurok.

Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 provide crucial information about the negation in Yurok. Specifically, they mention the use of the preverb ""neemee"" for negation:

- Paragraph 2 states: ""the ordinary negative preverb neemee, or (especially in Classical Yurok) its variants mee, ’eemee, and keemee 'will not'... neemee is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs.""
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of ""neemee"" used in sentences: 
  - (a) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’. “I don’t feel well.”
  - (b) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet. “It’s not very windy here.”
  - (c) Kue pa’aahl ’we-tmenomen neemee nepue’. “The half of the salmon facing the water was not eaten.”
  - (d) Muehlcho’ neemee soo komchuemehl. “Perhaps they do not know.”
  - (e) Neemee hegohkuemehl stowstek’ ’ue-’weskwen neemee mehl hego’omah. “They did not pick fir branches and did not make fire with them.”

The term ""preverb"" indicates that ""neemee"" is a bound morpheme that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. This fits the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Additionally, Paragraph 10 mentions the use of ""neemee"" with the resultative preverb ""keech,"" further supporting that ""neemee"" is used in conjunction with verbs to indicate negation.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is clear that standard negation in Yurok can be marked by a preverb (neemee) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The preverb ""neemee"" is used before the verb to indicate negation.
- Examples provided show ""neemee"" directly preceding the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.
- The term ""preverb"" indicates that it is bound to the verb, satisfying the criteria for standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Nuuchahnulth,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 4 provides clear examples of negation involving the clitic <""hs, which attaches to the verb to indicate negation. For instance, in the example ""vhJ`Qhsr"" (not=TEMP=PAST=INDIC.1sg), the clitic <""hs is used to mark negation directly on the verb. This demonstrates that negation in Nuuchahnulth can indeed be marked by a phonologically bound clitic.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the method of standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the negation particle ""Jut"" and predicates marked for irrealis mode, but it does not specify if the negation is bound to the verb.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that the negation particle ""Jut"" appears at the beginning of the clause followed by a nominalized predicate, indicating that the negation particle is separate and not bound to the verb.
3. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that the negation particle ""Jut"" is followed by a nominalized predicate, again suggesting that the negation is not bound to the verb.
4. **Paragraph 10** describes Pattern A negation, which involves a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause. The example given shows the negation particle ""lat"" followed by a nominalized verb form, indicating that the negation is not bound to the verb.
5. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of prohibitives with the negation particle ""lit"" followed by verbs marked for irrealis mood, but it does not indicate that the negation is bound to the verb.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negation in Columbia-Wenatchi is marked by a particle that precedes the verb and is not phonologically bound to it. The negation particle is followed by a nominalized or irrealis-marked predicate, but there is no indication of affixation, cliticization, or modification of the verb itself for standard negation.

### Reasoning:
- The negation particle ""Jut"" or ""lat"" appears at the beginning of the clause and is followed by a nominalized predicate, indicating that it is a separate particle and not an affix or clitic bound to the verb.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Hidatsa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Hidatsa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, paragraph 4.12 states that clausal negation is indicated by the negative suffix -dhaa attached to the predicate head. This is demonstrated in examples (266) through (270), where the negative suffix -dhaa is directly attached to the verb, forming a single phonological unit. Additionally, paragraph 6.1.2.2 provides an example of a prohibitive command formed by adding the imperative suffix to the negative suffix -dhaa, further confirming that negation is marked by an affix bound to the verb.

Examples:
- (266) Macéédhaac. (macéé-dhaa-c) 'He is not a man.'
- (267) Maaˀiiˀúùdi madú wareeg, úˀsiadhaac. (maaˀiiˀúùdi madú waree-g úˀsia-dhaa-c) 'Something must have happened, he hasn’t arrived.'
- (268) Hiirahbídhaa agáwaasd. (hiirahbí-dhaa agáhee-waa-sd) 'I didn’t think it would be hard.'

These examples clearly show that the negative suffix -dhaa is attached to the verb, indicating that standard negation in Hidatsa is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

From the provided paragraphs, we can observe several instances where the negative verb ""aqi"" is used in conjunction with subject markers to form negative constructions. Here are some key points that support the conclusion:

1. **Phonologically Bound Clitic:**
   - In Paragraph 1, we see examples like ""Qe=aqi"" where ""qe"" (3SG.NFUT) is a subject marker that forms a phonological unit with ""aqi"" (not.exist). This indicates that the negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Paragraph 5 also provides examples such as ""Qe=aqi kwasi thaofa"" (3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry), further supporting the presence of a phonologically bound clitic.

2. **Affixation and Cliticization:**
   - Paragraph 10 describes the double negative construction, where the structure includes a mini-clause with ""aqi"" and a subject marker like ""qe"" or ""ka"". This construction shows that the negation is marked by elements that are bound to the verb.
   - Paragraph 14 discusses sequential clauses of negation, where the sequential subject marker ""ka"" is used with ""aqi"" to express unfulfilled expectations. This again shows that negation involves bound elements.

3. **Modification of the Verb:**
   - Paragraph 17 mentions that ""aqi"" functions as a lexical verb with meanings like 'not be so', 'not be the case', 'not exist', and 'not be available'. This indicates that the verb itself is modified to express negation.

4. **Examples of Bound Negation:**
   - Paragraph 6 provides examples of the disagree construction ""qe=aqi"" (3SG.NFUT=not.be.so) used in replies to positive-polarity questions, indicating that the negation is bound to the verb.
   - Paragraph 8 shows the use of ""qe=aqi"" in negative responses to open questions, further supporting the presence of bound negation.

### Conclusion:
1

Standard negation in the language Toqabaqita can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",0,1
Aghu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Aghu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 4 mentions the use of the clitic ""=de"" in negated finite future forms, which attaches to the verb. For example, ""ade-Ø=dè xo"" (hear_II[1SG]-FUT=NEG COP) translates to ""I will not hear.""
- Paragraph 5 provides examples of negated forms using the clitic ""=de"" and the copula ""xo."" For instance, ""axi=dexo"" (go_II[1SG]=NEGCOP) means ""I will not go.""
- Paragraph 6 further illustrates the use of ""=de"" in negated verbal clauses, such as ""joxodebaxe-n=dexo"" (3PLLOCsit_II-VN=NEGCOP) meaning ""they are not here.""
- Paragraph 8 discusses the use of the clitic ""=kuoxo"" in negated semifinite irrealis and future forms, indicating another method of marking negation that is phonologically bound to the verb.

These examples clearly show that negation in Aghu involves clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Manambu can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Modification of the Verb:**
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in non-future negative clauses, the verb often takes a special negative form, which can involve vowel changes. For example, ""gra- ‘cry’"" becomes ""ma: ga:r ‘does not/did not cry’"". This indicates that the verb itself is modified to express negation.
   - Paragraph 1 also states that future tense in negative clauses is marked by postposing the negator ""ma:"" to the verb root, e.g., ""gra ma: ‘will not cry’"". This suggests that the verb form is directly involved in the negation process.

2. **Affixation:**
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the dependent negator ""-ma:r-"" used in various contexts, including dependent clauses and questions. This negator attaches to the verb stem, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.
   - Paragraph 8 further elaborates on the use of ""-ma:r-"" in negating questions and dependent clauses, showing that this affix is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Cliticization:**
   - Although not explicitly mentioned as clitics, the behavior of the negators ""ma:"" and ""-ma:r-"" in forming phonological units with the verb suggests a clitic-like function in some contexts.

### Conclusion: 1

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Manambu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Therefore, the appropriate response is 1.",1,1
Momu,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language Momu. The key points are as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - The example (12.43a) shows the negation marker ""momu"" attached to the verb ""netyi"" with the clitic ""="": `netyi=momu`.
   - Similarly, in (12.43b), ""ai-kuw"" is negated with ""momu"" as a clitic: `ai-kuw=momu`.
   - The description explicitly states that ""momu"" is a simple negator applied to verbal predicates and forms a phonological unit with the verb.

2. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Example (16.12b) shows the verb ""ai"" negated with ""momu"" as an affix: `ai-momu`.

These examples clearly indicate that the negation marker ""momu"" can be phonologically bound to the verb either as a clitic or an affix. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Makasae,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Makasae can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3 mentions the negative prefix ""ni-"" which is used to negate the meaning of the verb it is attached to. This is a clear indication that negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Additionally, Paragraph 12 provides examples of the negative prefix ""ni-"" in use, further supporting the conclusion that negation can be marked by an affix in Makasae.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Motuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Motuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs describe the use of negative infixes and suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb. For instance:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the ""Negative Optative"" forms, where negation is marked by suffixes such as ""-taa"" and ""-raa"" attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 8 details the ""negative infix /-woo-/"" which is used in various verb forms, indicating that negation can be marked by an infix that is phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 18 further elaborates on the use of the negative infix /-woo-/ in different verb forms, reinforcing the idea that negation is integrated into the verb morphology.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Motuna involves affixes and infixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through verb modification or affixation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Verbs can be negated using the verbal suffix -la, which usually, but not necessarily, involves a focus construction.""
   - ""The verbal suffix -la (glossed NEG) is used to negate a verb.""
   - Examples provided show the use of the suffix -la attached to verbs to indicate negation.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Further examples illustrate the use of the suffix -la for negation:
     - ""otailamal"" (show-NEG-du.m) meaning ""didn't show""
     - ""elelam"" (see-NEG) meaning ""has not seen""
     - ""kiulav"" (die-NEG-pl) meaning ""no-one died""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ‘no’; the intransitive verb tave ‘be not’; the negative imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.""
   - The negative suffix -la is highlighted as a method to negate verbs.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Examples of negation using the suffix -la in various contexts:
     - ""Omala"" (take-NEG-FUT) meaning ""we won't take""
     - ""elufula"" (leave-NEG) meaning ""can't do it""
     - ""merea"" (HAB-NEG-FUT) meaning ""can't cut""

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Discussion of the habitual auxiliary and its use with negated verbs, but still showing the use of the suffix -la for negation.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Examples of negation using the suffix -la:
     - ""foiga"" (fish-NEG-HAB-FUT) meaning ""we won’t catch any fish""

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples of negation using the suffix -la:
     - ""vola"" (come-NEG) meaning ""isn't coming""

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Examples of negation using the suffix -la:
     - ""foina"" (none) and ""tamu"" (no) used in conjunction with the negative suffix -la.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Examples of negation using the suffix -la:
     - ""olelam"" (see-NEG) meaning ""didn't see""
     - ""olelav"" (see-NEG-pl) meaning ""saw nothing""

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Examples of negation using the suffix -la:
      - ""olelam"" (see-NEG) meaning ""didn't see""
      - ""olelav"" (see-NEG-pl) meaning ""saw nothing""

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Lavukaleve is marked by the verbal suffix -la, which attaches directly to the verb. This suffix is an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Dla (Menggwa),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation for Negative Irrealis**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that negative irrealis verbs differ from positive irrealis verbs by having an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem. The forms of this affix are ma-, -ma, -me, or -m.
   - Paragraph 2 reiterates that negative irrealis is conveyed by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.
   - Paragraph 6 provides an example of an irregular negative irrealis affixation: si[ma]ha-.

2. **Affixation for Negative Realis**:
   - Paragraph 4 provides examples of negative realis verbs formed by affixing -boka to the verb stem (e.g., kliklibokahwa for 'did not scratch').
   - Paragraph 5 discusses the innovative negative realis forms where the negative irrealis affix (ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m) is used to indicate negative realis (e.g., ma-ser-iha-hwa for 'did not chew').

3. **Negative Semi-Realis**:
   - Paragraph 16 mentions that negative semi-realis verbs are formed with a negative semi-realis particle ga followed by a finite verb stem and cross-reference suffixes. However, since ga is a separate phonological word, it does not count towards the feature in question.

4. **Negative Realis Verb Forms**:
   - Paragraph 12 and Paragraph 20 describe that negative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus a following negative realis verb boke or boka, which are separate phonological words. This indicates that for negative realis, the negation is not marked by an affix or modification of the verb itself but by a separate verb.

Given the evidence of affixation for negative irrealis and the innovative use of these affixes for negative realis, it is clear that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Duna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Duna can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in multiple instances where the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to negate verbal predicates. This circumfix attaches directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Examples include:

- ""na-ra-ya"" (NEG-be/sit-NEG) in ""This one does not exist on our land.""
- ""na-ke-ya-o"" (NEG-see-NEG-PFV) in ""I didn’t see.""
- ""na-na-ya-na"" (NEG-eat-NEG-HAB) in ""I don’t eat snake.""
- ""na-hoa-ya"" (NEG-come-NEG) in ""It didn’t come.""
- ""na-rakare-ya-yarua"" (NEG-cold-NEG-SNS.C) in ""I am not cold {I feel}.""

These examples demonstrate that the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to mark negation on verbs, confirming that negation in Duna can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Taulil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Taulil can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negator ""kori"" is used before the verb to negate verbal clauses, and this negator forms a phonological unit with the verb complex. For example, in Paragraph 3, it is mentioned that ""Prototypical verbal clauses such as (di-)transitive and active intransitive clauses can be negated by inserting kori before the verb."" This indicates that the negation marker ""kori"" is phonologically bound to the verb, meeting the criteria for standard negation.

Additionally, Paragraph 15 provides examples of negation in verbal clauses where ""kori"" is used immediately before the verb complex, further supporting the conclusion that negation in Taulil involves a phonological unit with the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Taiap,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language Taiap. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The negated form of verbs involves the verb root followed by an irrealis suffix and the negator ""wákare"".
   - Example: ""okɨ wákare"" (go.irr-irr neg) for ""I didn’t go"", ""they didn’t go"", etc.
   - The irrealis suffixes are -ki, -kɨ, or -ku, which are attached to the verb stem.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Negation in transitive verbs also involves the verb root followed by an irrealis suffix and the negator ""wákare"".
   - Example: ""akru wákare"" (consume.irr-3sg.f.irr.o neg) for ""he didn’t eat pork"", ""she didn’t eat pork"", etc.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - In negated intransitive verbs, subject suffixes disappear, and modality is marked by irrealis suffixes -kɨ, -ki, or -ku.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - The formation of the negative involves the irrealis verb stem followed by the irrealis suffix and the negator ""wákare"".
   - Example: ""o-kɨ wákare"" (go.irr-irr neg) for ""X didn’t/won’t go"".

5. **Paragraph 17**:
   - The irrealis form of intransitive verbs includes the verb stem plus the irrealis suffix -kɨ, which is used in negation.
   - Example: ""namkɨ wákare"" (talk.irr-irr neg) for ""X didn’t/won’t talk"".

6. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example of negation in a conditional clause: ""yu ŋaŋan nam tariati wákare, ŋayi yu adrunet"" (If you don’t listen to my talk, I am going to hit you).

7. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Example of negation in a command: ""memkɨ wákare"" (get_up.irr-irr neg) for ""didn’t get up"" or ""won’t get up"".

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Taiap involves the use of irrealis suffixes (-ki, -kɨ, -ku) attached to the verb stem, followed by the negator ""wákare"". These suffixes are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Yimas,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yimas can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. The evidence is as follows:

- Paragraph 1 describes how the negative verb is affixed with a particular suffix that references the number of the S argument. Examples include ""ta-pu-wa-na-rm"" (NEG-3-go-NR PAST-DL) and ""ta-pu-wa-na-m"" (NEG-3-go-NR PAST-PL), where ""ta-"" is the negative prefix.
  
- Paragraph 2 further supports this by showing examples like ""ta-nan-i-c-IJkan-mpan-mpwi"" (NEG-2PL A-tell-PERF-PC-3PL D-talk), where ""ta-"" is the negative prefix attached to the verb.

- Paragraph 3 shows examples such as ""ta-mpu-IJa-tkam-r-IJ"" (NEG-3PL A-1SG D-show-PERF-VI SG), again indicating the use of ""ta-"" as a negative prefix.

- Paragraph 5 provides additional examples like ""ta-pu-wa-t-0"" (NEG-3-go-PERF-SG), where ""ta-"" is the negative prefix.

- Paragraph 13 explicitly states that negation is marked by the prefix ""ta-"" which occupies the first prefixal slot of the verb, shifting the normal pronominal prefix to the final suffixal slot of the word.

These examples consistently show that the negative prefix ""ta-"" is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation in Yimas is marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 10 provides an example where negation is marked directly on the verb:

```plaintext
b. Yow! epiengku Markusu epne krar yow srsei...
yow epiengku Markusu epne krar yow
markus-u e=pne krar yow
NEG TOP.DIST.ERG.SG markus-ERG TOP=FOC.DIST dog NEG
s\rse/i
s\rse/i
>3.
.
\hit.
SG>3.HOD.DUR\hit.RS
‘No, Markus didn’t hit that dog.’
```

In this example, the negation is marked by the element ""yow"" which is used in conjunction with the verb ""srsei"" (hit). The presence of ""yow"" before the verb indicates that negation is being marked in a way that is phonologically bound to the verb phrase.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Maybrat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, it is evident that standard negation in Maybrat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the use of the negator ""fe"" and its predicative counterpart ""m-fe"". The examples provided show that ""m-fe"" is used as a verb form to indicate negation, which suggests that it is a bound form (affix or clitic) attached to the verb. For instance, in (166) ""arko m-fe"" ('there is no firewood'), ""m-fe"" functions as a negative verb form.

- **Paragraph 5**: Further supports the use of ""m-fe"" as a bound form for negation. Example (179) contrasts ""arko fe"" ('not firewood') with ""arko m-fe"" ('there is no firewood'), indicating that ""m-fe"" is used as a predicative negator attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that when ""-fe"" is used predicatively, it takes a third person unmarked prefix, as in ""rae ro sme m-fe"" ('he is not a male'), reinforcing that ""m-fe"" is a bound form used for negation.

- **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the use of ""fe"" and ""m-fe"" in various contexts, including their combination with other adverbials. The examples show that ""m-fe"" functions as a bound form indicating negation.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that Maybrat uses ""m-fe"" as a bound form (affix or clitic) to mark standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Asmat language, it is possible to determine that standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions specific forms of the verb that can precede negations, such as the m-/mV- forms and the tense-aspect categories of verbs with the formative ""por."" It also describes negations like ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" that can form groups with these verb forms. For example:
   - ""m@or pdk embf"" (see not /did) translates to ""I did not see it.""
   - ""Sujit masetdj powd"" (Sujit has not arrived).

2. **Paragraph 4** provides further examples of negation linked with verbs:
   - ""manapor PZnakdw"" (want to eat / why not) translates to ""why won't you eat them!""
   - ""owerbs w o p o r o m t d r empdrmin O p n a k d"" (husband /to find / I try / but no) translates to ""I am trying to find a husband, but without success.""

3. **Paragraph 11** explicitly states that there is a negative construction with ""pak"" (not), which is linked to the verb forms.

4. **Paragraph 18** mentions forms with the prefix ""tep-/tepa-"" that express negative questions, such as:
   - ""tipa-pbr-c&zdm"" (why don't you usually look at it?).

These examples indicate that negation in Asmat can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb, as the negation markers ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" are phonologically bound to the verb forms they accompany.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Kuot,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Kuot can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate that the most general negator in Kuot is ""tǝle,"" which can attach to the verb as a clitic. For example, in paragraph 3, it is stated: ""The most general negator is tǝle, which negates any type of predicate. It occurs before the negated constituent: (17) Tǝle=kan [u-me ubi] NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø ‘He didn’t use to work’."" This indicates that ""tǝle"" can form a phonological unit with the verb, qualifying it as a clitic.

Additionally, paragraph 7 provides another example: ""Samǝtmǝrun lǝ [tǝle u-me ubi]. RELR NEG 3mS-HAB work=Ø. ‘Samǝtmǝrun didn’t work.’"" Here, ""tǝle"" is used in conjunction with the verb phrase, further supporting the conclusion that negation can be marked by a clitic in Kuot.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the suffix **-m** which serves both as a negation and an interrogative marker. This suffix is attached to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** further elaborates that the suffix **-m** is a verbal suffix used to mark both negation and interrogation. It is realized as **-me** in some contexts. This confirms that the negation marker is indeed an affix attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4** states that the negative imperative or prohibitive is formed discontinuously by the free particle **an** and the negative suffix **-m**. This again shows the use of a suffix for negation.

4. **Paragraph 10** notes that in prohibitives, the negation marker **-m** is always realized as **[m]** and never as **[me]**. This emphasizes the consistent use of the suffix **-m** for negation in certain contexts.

5. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of the suffix **-i** used in past negation and questions, showing that the suffix **-m** can be used in conjunction with other suffixes to mark negation.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Imonda can be marked by an affix (specifically the suffix **-m**) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Nimboran can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions the sentence ""bekdbaku kuo be, u6Mku - I did not kick above, I dibbled above."" Here, ""kuo"" appears to be a negation marker that is used in conjunction with the verb forms ""bekdbaku"" and ""u6Mku."" The structure suggests that ""kuo"" is a separate word (particle) used for negation. However, the presence of ""be"" in the sentence ""bekdbaku kuo be"" indicates that ""be"" might be a bound morpheme related to negation.

2. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of verb forms with different morphemes indicating various grammatical categories. It shows that Nimboran verbs can be modified by adding morphemes to indicate tense, aspect, and other grammatical features. This implies that the language has a system of affixation for modifying verbs.

3. **Paragraph 7** mentions the morpheme ""-p-"" preceding the Actor morpheme to indicate the Recent Past. This demonstrates that Nimboran uses affixes to modify verbs for grammatical purposes, supporting the possibility that negation could also be marked in a similar way.

4. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of morphemes ""-d-"", ""-t-"", and ""-k-"" to indicate future, present, and past tenses, respectively. This further supports the idea that Nimboran uses affixes to modify verbs.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Nimboran can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Abun,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abun is primarily marked by the use of negative particles, specifically ""yo"" and ""nde"". These particles are used to bracket the predicate, with ""yo"" preceding the predicate and ""nde"" following it. There is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The particles are described as free forms that do not attach to the verb or any other constituent in a phonologically bound manner.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 4: The negative particle ""nde"" is used after the predicate and is not attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 5: Abun does not use affixes to negate words.
- Paragraph 6: The primary negative particle ""nde"" and the secondary particle ""yo"" are used in conjunction to form negative sentences, with ""yo"" preceding the predicate and ""nde"" following it.
- Paragraph 8: The negative particle ""nde"" is described as a free form word that does not take any type of inflection and is not bound.
- Paragraph 11: The main NEG-marker ""nde"" is not attached to the verb and is frequently distant from it.
- Paragraph 14: The structure of a negative indicative sentence involves bracketing the predicate with ""yo"" and ""nde"".

Given this consistent description of negation using free-standing particles that bracket the predicate, it is clear that standard negation in Abun cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Meryam Mir,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, it is possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the relevant information and reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1 (5.6 Negation)**:
   - The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" (in free variation) is used to negate an event.
   - Examples:
     - (5.77) wi kikem-ge le nole umer-kak da-r(a)a
       - 'They did not know at first.'
     - (5.78) e ne tabra mamorser tabra bud itkiri op-ge
       - 'She did not properly wipe off the mud on her face.'
     - (5.79) ma nole abi dip0
       - 'Don't dob him in.'

2. **Analysis**:
   - The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" precedes the verb and is not attached to the verb as an affix or clitic.
   - There is no indication that the negation is marked by a modification of the verb itself or by an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the information provided, standard negation in Meryam Mir is marked by a separate particle that precedes the verb and is not phonologically bound to it.
   - There is no evidence from the given paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Hatam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the standard negation in Hatam is marked by the negative adverb ""big,"" which is always in clause-final position. There is no evidence in the given paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples consistently show ""big"" as a separate word that follows the entire clause, rather than being attached to the verb or modifying it directly.

For instance, in Paragraph 3:
- (4.93) ""Yoni i-kwei ei Mar big-yo."" (They have not yet come to Warmare.)
- (4.92) ""Njap gom dem mem ni-pilei hab can kan big."" (One day was not at all enough for us to shoot two birds.)

In Paragraph 10:
- (4.90) ""hab hi Ieni ji-ttei big"" (You didn't bring a bird, did you?)

These examples demonstrate that ""big"" is used as a separate word to indicate negation, and it is not phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The negative marker ""big"" is consistently shown as a separate word in clause-final position.
2. There is no indication that ""big"" attaches to the verb as an affix or clitic.
3. The examples provided do not show any modification of the verb itself to indicate negation.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Kwomtari,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Kwomtari can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this is found in several instances:

- Paragraph 2 mentions that ""in all verbal clauses the number and person of the subject, and generally the goal, if present, are marked on the verb by suffixation.""
- Paragraph 4 explicitly states that ""glei is used in conjunction with the clause final negative suffix -i, which is discussed further in §7.2.""
- Paragraph 9 further clarifies that ""If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being preceded by glei.""

These points indicate that the negation involves a suffix (-i) that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb root.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Inanwatan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-aigo"" is used to mark negation on the verb. This is evident from the examples provided in Paragraph 2:

- ""(Nawo) ne-se-s-aigo"" (not I SG.s-walk-FUT-NEG) which translates to ""I am not going to walk.""
- ""Ma-ge-re-reneqo-y-aigo"" (do-PAST-and catch-TR-NEG) which translates to ""They did not catch him and he went out via the Usuqo arm, that it's name.""

Additionally, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative suffix ""-aigo"" and its phonological behavior when following certain vowels or suffixes, further supporting that negation is marked by an affix.

Paragraph 5 also provides an example of the verb form ""-eri-aigo"" used in negative attributive-equative clauses, reinforcing the use of the negative suffix ""-aigo"" in verb negation.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can indeed be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Iau can be marked by particles that immediately follow the verb. Specifically, the particles 'ae' and 'ai' are used for negation and are phonologically bound to the verb or verb phrase. This is evident from multiple examples where these particles follow the verb directly, forming a phonological unit with it. For instance:

- ""Y⁸ bui² i⁷ ai⁹ y⁴."" (We didn't /never did go upstream.)
- ""A⁹ to⁶ i⁷ ae⁵."" (I did not go at all.)
- ""Ba⁶⁻³ y⁸ to⁶ a² i⁷ ae⁵."" (No, we did not (emphatic contrastive) go by land.)

These examples demonstrate that the negation particles 'ae' and 'ai' are bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine definitively whether standard negation in Karkar-Yuri can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provided do not contain clear examples or descriptions of negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. 

Here is the reasoning for each relevant paragraph:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph is fragmented and does not provide clear information about negation.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions subject clitics but does not discuss negation.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses interrogative constructions but not negation.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Contains the word ""Negokwe"" which might be related to negation, but the context is unclear and does not provide enough information to determine if it is an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses habitual mood and desiderative constructions but not negation.
6. **Paragraph 13**: Contains examples of verbs and constructions but does not mention negation.
7. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses sequence and connective verbs but not negation.

Given the lack of clear and relevant information about the method of standard negation in the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine the method of negation from the given data.

**Conclusion**: 0",1,0
Yelî Dnye,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Yelî Dnye. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions ""The basic form used in negation is daa 'not'.""
2. **Paragraph 3** provides forms of the negative used in equative clauses, including ""daa"" and its variants depending on the environment.
3. **Paragraph 7** shows an example of negation in a future statement: ""Kele, daa -ni'ni. No, I ' m not going.""
4. **Paragraph 8** lists ""negation"" as one of the factors affecting the predicate and mentions ""daa"" as the basic form.
5. **Paragraph 14** provides examples where ""daa"" is used in negative constructions: ""daa -ni'ni"" and ""daa-paa.""

From these points, it is evident that the morpheme ""daa"" is used for negation. The example in Paragraph 7, ""daa -ni'ni,"" shows that ""daa"" can be attached to the verb complex, indicating it functions as a bound morpheme in this context. Additionally, Paragraph 14's examples further support the use of ""daa"" in a bound form.

### Reasoning:
- **Affix/Clitic Evidence**: The use of ""daa"" in constructions like ""daa -ni'ni"" suggests it can be phonologically bound to the verb complex.
- **Modification of the Verb**: There is no explicit evidence of verb modification for negation in the provided paragraphs.
- **Bound Morpheme**: The examples indicate that ""daa"" can be used as a bound morpheme, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation.

### Conclusion:
1

The evidence supports that standard negation in Yelî Dnye can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Sentani can indeed be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly mentions the presence of a negative circumfix, ə- -j NEG, which attaches directly to the verb root to negate the verb. This circumfix is a clear example of an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 4**: Further elaborates on the negative circumfix, confirming that it attaches directly to the verb root and negates the verb itself rather than the entire sentence.

3. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions another circumfix, the habitual j- -jə HAB, which attaches to the first suffix that follows the verb root. Although this is about the habitual aspect, it reinforces the pattern of circumfixes in the language.

4. **Paragraph 11**: Provides an example of the negative circumfix in use, showing its placement around the verb root.

These points collectively confirm that Sentani uses a negative circumfix to mark standard negation, which is an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mpur is marked by the adverb ""jan,"" which always occurs in the clause-final position. There is no evidence in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples given show ""jan"" as a separate word that follows the predicate or the main clause, indicating that it is not phonologically bound to the verb.

Here are the relevant points from the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 2: ""The adverb of negation jan always occurs clause-finally.""
- Paragraph 3: ""This utterance can be disambiguated by positioning the negative element directly following the predicate of the main clause.""
- Paragraph 4: Examples show ""jan"" as a separate word following the main clause or predicate.

Since ""jan"" is described as an adverb that occurs clause-finally and is not bound to the verb, it does not qualify as an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
The provided paragraphs indicate that the negation in Mpur is achieved through the use of the adverb ""jan,"" which is not phonologically bound to the verb. There is no mention of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself for standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Mehek,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Mehek can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly mentions that one way of expressing negation is by adding a suffix `-nak` to the verb. This is a clear indication that negation can be marked by an affix that attaches directly to the verb.
   
   Example from Paragraph 1:
   ```
   (111) on i rete-wa-m iki mu rii-nak
   1SG go put-PAST1-3PL NEG 3PL remain-VNEG
   ‘[The things] I put are not there anymore.’
   ```

2. **Paragraph 2** further supports this by stating that the primary negative morpheme `iki` occasionally co-occurs with the suffix `-nak` on the verb.

   Example from Paragraph 2:
   ```
   (337) na-r su iki su duwan lau=ka rusu-nak
   but-M 3SG.F NEG 3SG.F limbum spread.flat=REAL stand-VNEG
   ‘But she did not put the limbum bed out to sit on.’
   ```

3. **Paragraph 6** describes another construction where the suffix `-nak` appears on the auxiliary verb `na` following the main verb in its infinitival form.

   Example from Paragraph 6:
   ```
   (341) iki kur=k bruru=ka i-r na-nak
   NEG sky=LOC fly=REAL go-INF be.at-VNEG
   ‘It [cassowary] does not fly in the sky.’
   ```

These examples clearly show that the suffix `-nak` is used to mark negation directly on the verb or an auxiliary verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Abui,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abui is marked by the verb ""naha"" which means 'not be' or 'NEG'. This verb follows the negated verb phrase (VP) and is glossed as NEG. For example, in the sentence ""neenaha"" (eat-NEG) meaning ""do not eat"" and ""natukoi naha"" (1SG be.strong NEG) meaning ""I am not strong"", the negation is marked by the verb ""naha"" which follows the main verb. This indicates that negation is achieved through a separate verb rather than an affix, clitic, or modification of the main verb itself.

2. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that suggests the use of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb for standard negation. The negation is consistently marked by the separate verb ""naha"".

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Arapesh (Abu),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 provides an example where the negation is marked within the verb complex:

> 25. «kk-u -k -a -ha -'  
> 3SGEA -IR-NONPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU  
> 'She did not hit her.’  
> ‘She uwa' not

This example shows the negation marker ""uwa'"" being used in conjunction with the verb complex, indicating that negation can be marked within the verb phrase. Additionally, the presence of the morphemes ""-u -k -a -ha -"" suggests that negation is integrated into the verb morphology.

Paragraph 9 also supports this by mentioning the use of the negative verbal lexeme ""ko'isi"" in prohibitive constructions, which can follow other verb forms, indicating that negation can be part of the verb phrase.

Therefore, the evidence points to the fact that negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Korafe,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korafe can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation**: The negative deverbal form ""-ae"" is used to negate verbal predicates. This is a clear example of an affix that attaches to the verb stem to indicate negation. For instance, in Paragraph 8, the sentence ""Na jo ning-ae=ri"" translates to ""I didn't hear (what was said),"" where ""ning-ae"" is the negative form of the verb ""hear.""

2. **Modification of the Verb**: The negative deverbal ""-ae"" combines with the verb stem to form a negative construction. This is seen in multiple examples, such as in Paragraph 6: ""Nu jo namane s-aoro siror-ae=ri,"" which translates to ""It wasn't we that caused him to be born,"" where ""siror-ae"" is the negative form of the verb ""be born.""

3. **Cliticization**: The negative focus marker ""jo"" often precedes the verb or the focused constituent, and the negative deverbal ""-ae"" terminates the negated segment. This structure is consistent across various examples, indicating that the negation is closely tied to the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that Korafe uses affixation and modification of the verb to mark standard negation.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the negation in Alamblak. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions a morphological negative form in the hortative present tense verb, specifically with the form ""-kah"".
2. **Paragraph 6** provides an example of a negative construction involving the verb ""tandhi-ak-ni-r-me-t-mroast-get-go-IRR-R.PST-3SF-3PL"", where ""NEG"" appears to be part of the verb complex.
3. **Paragraph 13** gives an example of a negative hortative construction: ""yen r22.tameh mch ild what-a-yay-wah-r HORT-eat-IRR-3SM.HORT.PR 'What should the child not eat?'""

From these points, it is evident that negation in Alamblak can involve morphological changes to the verb, such as the addition of specific morphemes like ""-kah"" or other complex verb forms that include negation markers.

### Reasoning:
- **Paragraph 4** explicitly states that the hortative present tense verb exhibits a morphological negative form with ""-kah"".
- **Paragraph 6** shows a complex verb form where negation is integrated into the verb morphology.
- **Paragraph 13** provides an example of a negative hortative verb form, indicating that negation can be marked within the verb structure.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Alamblak can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, it is clear that standard negation in the language is marked by the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears clause-finally. There is no evidence in the provided text that suggests the negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples consistently show ""mi"" as a separate particle at the end of the clause, not bound to the verb or any other constituent.

Here is the reasoning for the chosen option:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that negation is expressed with the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears clause-finally. The examples provided show ""mi"" following the predicate and any oblique nominals.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** reinforces this by stating that negation is marked once per clause and always at the end of the clause, following the predicate and any oblique nominals.

3. **Paragraph 4** further supports this by showing examples where ""mi"" is used clause-finally, even when there are postverbal elements.

4. **Paragraph 5** discusses the scope of the negative marker ""mi,"" again indicating its position at the end of the clause.

5. **Paragraph 6** mentions clause-final particles, including negation, but does not indicate that these particles are bound to the verb.

6. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 10** provide additional examples and explanations that show ""mi"" as a clause-final particle, not bound to the verb.

Given this consistent description and the examples provided, it is clear that standard negation in I'saka is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by a separate particle ""mi"" that appears at the end of the clause.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Urim,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The verbal negator ""ake"" is used for verbal clauses and can occur either immediately before or after the subject, but always between a fronted subject and the verb.
   - Examples:
     - ""Ake kil atning"" (NEG 3sg listen.R) - 'He did not listen.'
     - ""Tu ake kai anong"" (3pl NEG go village) - 'They did not go to the village/home.'

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The verbal negator ""ake"" normally occurs immediately before the verb (or serial verb phrase).
   - Examples:
     - ""Kil ake kul"" (3sg NEG come) - 'She did not come.'
     - ""Ake wang a kai"" (NEG time REL go) - 'It is not time to go yet.'
     - ""Kupm ake yul"" (1sg NEG fish) - 'I do not have fish.'

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The negative word ""ake"" is used in nominal clauses even if there is no verbal predicate.
   - Examples:
     - ""Kupm ake yul"" (1sg NEG fish) - 'I do not have fish.'

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negator ""ake"" is used in verbal clauses and is placed in close proximity to the verb, either immediately before or after the subject. This indicates that ""ake"" is a particle that is not phonologically bound to the verb but is used in a specific syntactic position relative to the verb and subject.

### Conclusion:
0

The negation in Urim is marked by a particle ""ake"" that is not phonologically bound to the verb but rather occurs in a specific syntactic position relative to the verb and subject. Therefore, standard negation in Urim cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",0,0
Abau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation markers ""pey"" and ""pa"" are used to negate verbal clauses with imperfective and perfective aspects, respectively. These markers occur clause-finally, which suggests they are phonologically bound to the verb phrase. For example:

- In paragraph 6, example (18): ""Hakwe hye nonkway lwak pey."" (1S-TOP 3S.M-OBJ know be NEG.IPFTV) translates to ""I do not know him.""
- In paragraph 6, example (22): ""Enekwei sehiy non hakwe hano sa ke nonkway lwak pa."" (DDEM-3S.M CMT 1S-TOP 1S-GEN woman time 3S.F-OBJ know be NEG.PFTV) translates to ""At that time I did not know my wife.""

These examples show that the negation markers ""pey"" and ""pa"" are affixed to the verb phrase, indicating that negation in Abau can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Chamorro,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Chamorro can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Chamorro has three ways of expressing sentence negation: with the sentential negative ""ti,"" with a negative verb, or with a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. This indicates that negation can be directly associated with the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples where negation is expressed using ""ti"" and negative verbs. Specifically, it mentions ""cha’-mu"" (better.not-AGR) and ""ti para bai facho’chu’"" (not FUT AGR work). The presence of ""cha’-mu"" suggests that negation can be marked on the verb itself, indicating a bound morpheme.

3. **Paragraph 5** discusses negative concord and provides examples where negation is expressed by the negative verb ""tåya’"" (not exist). This further supports the idea that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

4. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of sentences with the negative verb ""tåya’"" and the sentential negative ""ti,"" reinforcing that negation can be marked on the verb.

5. **Paragraph 13** mentions that the negative ""ti"" is phonologically dependent and must lean on material to its right, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb or other constituents.

6. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of negative sentences with the negative verb ""cha’-,"" further supporting the presence of bound morphemes for negation.

Given this information, it is clear that Chamorro can mark standard negation by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Awtuw,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Awtuw can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraphs 2 and 3 describe the use of the negative prefix ""ka-"" or ""ki-"" which fills the first slot in the verb complex to negate any verbal predicate. This prefix is clearly an affix as it attaches directly to the verb and forms a phonological unit with it.

For example:
- In Paragraph 3: ""Awt i y k�-w- �y - re"" (Awtiy NG-NF-go-FU) translates to ""Awtiy isn 't going"".
- Another example from the same paragraph: ""Awt i y- re wan k a - d - uwpo-ka"" (Awtiy-o lSG NG-FA-See- PF) translates to ""I haven 't seen Awtiy"".

These examples demonstrate that the negative prefix ""ka-"" is used to negate the verb directly, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mian can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative clitic =ba is used to express negation in clauses containing a finite verb, as seen in Paragraph 2. This clitic follows the subject suffix or the tense suffix and attaches directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Additionally, Paragraph 5 mentions the use of the negative particle mo and the clitic =ba in negated verbal predications, further supporting the presence of phonologically bound negation markers.

Examples from the paragraphs include:
- (198) n 1SG mén=o=mo string_bag=PL.N1=NEG ol-êb PL.RESID.O-take.PFV un-aamab-i=ba=be go.PFV-IRR.NANPL-1SG.SBJ=DECL ‘I will not carry the string bags.’
- (199) n 1SG mén=o=mo string_bag=PL.N1=NEG un-Ø-i-bio=ba=be go.PFV-IRR.NANPL-1SG.SBJ=DECL ‘I didn’t carry the string bags.’

These examples demonstrate that the clitic =ba attaches to the verb, marking it for negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Chácobo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the verb ""ak"" (do) in combination with the negative morpheme ""yáma"" used as a negative response.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that the marker of verbal and clausal negation is ""=yáma"" and provides examples of its usage with verbs.
3. **Paragraph 4** provides an example where the negation morpheme ""=yáma"" is used directly with the verb ""see"" (tʃani).
4. **Paragraph 5** shows the negation morpheme ""=yáma"" in a fixed position with respect to other elements in the clause, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.
5. **Paragraph 9** gives an example where the negative morpheme ""yáma"" is used with the verb ""speak"" (tʃani).
6. **Paragraph 11** explicitly states that verbs combine with the negative marker ""=yama"".
7. **Paragraph 14** includes a template showing the negation morpheme ""yáma"" as part of the verb stratum, indicating its integration into the verb structure.

These paragraphs collectively provide sufficient evidence that the negative morpheme ""=yáma"" is used in combination with verbs and is phonologically bound to them, either as a clitic or an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Hup,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Hup can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -nˆ¤h is used exclusively with verbal predicates to indicate negation. This suffix attaches directly to the verb stem, forming a phonological unit with it. Multiple examples illustrate this usage:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that the negative marker -nˆ¤h usually takes the place of the otherwise obligatory Boundary Suffix on the verb stem in affirmative clauses.
- Paragraph 6 explicitly states that the negative marker -nˆ¤h occurs as a suffix on the verb stem and is used exclusively for negating the verb phrase predicate.
- Paragraph 13 provides examples of the negative suffix -nˆ¤h being used with verbs, such as in ""ham-nˆ¤h-ay"" (go-NEG-INCH) meaning ‘(I’m) not going.’

These examples confirm that the negative marker -nˆ¤h is an affix that attaches to the verb, thereby fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kwaza,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Kwaza can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative morpheme ""-he-"" is consistently described as a suffix that attaches to the verb to indicate negation. This is evident in multiple examples where the negative suffix ""-he-"" is used within the verb complex, preceding person and mood markers or following them in the case of countersupposition.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, the example ""ja-'he-da-ki"" (eat-NEG-1S-DEC) clearly shows the negative suffix ""-he-"" attached to the verb root ""ja-"" (eat). Similarly, Paragraph 12 explicitly states that ""negation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-,"" and provides examples such as ""awͿi-'he-da-ki"" (see-NEG-1S-DEC) and ""kui-'he-(c)wa-ki"" (drink-NEG-IS-DEC).

These examples and descriptions confirm that the negative morpheme ""-he-"" is an affix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Huambisa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Huambisa (also referred to as Wampis) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention the use of the negative suffixes -t͡ʃa and -t͡ʃau for negation. These suffixes are attached to the verb or copula, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb or copula itself.

For example:
- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative verbal morpheme -t͡ʃa attached to the copula itself.
- Paragraph 3 discusses the negative suffixes -t͡ʃa and -t͡ʃu, which are used on verbs in different contexts.
- Paragraph 10 provides examples of the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau attached to nominal or adjectival complements, which then attach to copula clitics.
- Paragraph 16 further elaborates on the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau, which is derived from the verbal negative morpheme -t͡ʃa and the Set II nominalizer -u.

These examples clearly show that negation in Huambisa can be marked by affixes or modifications that are phonologically bound to the verb or copula.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Cocama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** (530-531) describes the use of the negative particle **tɨma**. It is clear that **tɨma** is a particle that negates the whole clause, verb phrase, adverbs, and noun phrases. The examples provided show **tɨma** preceding the verb or other constituents to negate them, but there is no indication that **tɨma** is an affix or clitic bound to the verb. It is described as a particle that can appear in various positions within the clause.

2. **Paragraph 3** (532-534) discusses the negative particle **ni**. Similar to **tɨma**, **ni** is used to negate single units, generally core arguments of the clause. The examples show **ni** preceding the negated element, but again, there is no indication that **ni** is an affix or clitic bound to the verb. It is described as a particle that is used in specific contexts.

3. **Paragraph 6** (260-262) and **Paragraph 12** (435-437) further confirm that **tɨma** and **ni** are particles used for negation. They are not described as affixes or clitics that attach to the verb. Instead, they are independent particles that precede the negated element.

4. **Paragraph 17** (704-706) and **Paragraph 16** (433-434) provide additional examples of negation with **tɨma** and **ni**. These paragraphs reinforce the understanding that these negative particles are not bound to the verb as affixes or clitics.

Given the consistent description of **tɨma** and **ni** as independent particles used for negation, and the lack of evidence suggesting that they are affixes or clitics bound to the verb, we can conclude that standard negation in Cocama is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tiriyo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in the language Tiriyo. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 5**:
   - The examples provided show the use of the suffix `-ewa` for negation:
     - `in-akoronma-ewa` (help-Neg)
     - `i-kéhtun-jewa` (scream-Neg)
     - `e-pé-ewa` (bathe-Neg)
     - `in-eta-ewa` (hear-Neg)
   - These examples clearly indicate that negation is marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The negative suffix `-sewa` is mentioned as a verbal negative suffix derived from the negative particle `wa`.
   - This reinforces the idea that negation in Tiriyo can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 8**:
   - The paragraph discusses the historical derivation of the negative suffix `-sewa` from the negative particle `wa`, further confirming the use of a suffix for negation.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - It mentions that negative constructions in Tiriyo are copular clauses built around the negative form of the verb, which aligns with the use of a negative suffix.

5. **Paragraph 11**:
   - The suffix `-sewa` is described in detail, showing its use in negative forms of transitive and intransitive stems.

From these points, it is evident that standard negation in Tiriyo can be marked by an affix (specifically, a suffix) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ticuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ticuna, it is possible to determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that standard negation in Ticuna involves the adjunction of the morpheme ""tãů"" (‘neg’) to the corresponding positive clause. This indicates that negation is achieved by adding a specific morpheme to the clause.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides an example of the prohibitive construction where ""tãů"" is used as a negative marker. It shows that ""tãů"" can be used to mark negation in prohibitive utterances, suggesting that it is a bound morpheme used for negation.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses pro-sentential negation, where ""tãů"" is used as a universal pro-sentential negation marker, similar to English ""no."" This further supports the idea that ""tãů"" is a bound morpheme used for negation.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph explains that ""tãů"" is not used for existential and topical-locational negation, which instead uses the verb ""tåʼu"" (‘be absent’). However, it confirms that ""tãů"" is the standard negator for other types of clauses.

5. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions that in clauses with existential indefinites, the standard negator ""tãů"" is replaced by negative existential indefinites. This indicates that ""tãů"" is the standard negator in other contexts.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of ""tãů"" in various contexts, reinforcing its role as a standard negator.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ticuna can be marked by the morpheme ""tãů,"" which is a bound morpheme attached to the verb or clause. This satisfies the criteria for being considered an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation of the Standard Negative Marker -ñe**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, specifically noting the standard negative marker -ñe.
   - Paragraph 2 reiterates that negation in declarative clauses is expressed by the standard negative marker -ñe added to a corresponding positive.
   - Paragraph 3 provides examples showing the standard negative marker -ñe attached to verbs:
     - (10.1b) ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED (swim-NEG-LK-1sg) ‘I don’t swim’
     - (10.93) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED (burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg) ‘I didn’t set the fire’
   - Paragraph 6 confirms that negation involves the affixation of the standard negative -ñe to verbs in both main and subordinate clauses.

2. **Position in Verb Structure**:
   - Paragraph 3 also specifies that the standard negative marker -ñe occupies slot 10 on the verb structure, indicating its integration into the verb morphology.

3. **Examples of Negated Verbs**:
   - Numerous examples throughout the paragraphs show verbs negated by the affix -ñe:
     - (10.11) fata-ta-ñe-d-ePRED (kill-CAUS-NEG-LK-3) ‘He did not make me kill the fish’
     - (10.12) i-aka-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED (exist-DES-NEG-LK-1sg) ‘I do not want to live with white people’
     - (10.13) fɨno-ñe-gaPRED (make-NEG-PASS) ‘This canoe was not made by your father’

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Iquito can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that negation is expressed through a negative morpheme marked on the verb and a negative particle in the postverbal position.
2. **Paragraph 2** specifies that the negative morpheme `-ji` is attached to the verbal stem, followed by tense/aspect information and the negative particle `caa`.
3. **Paragraph 5** indicates that some negative clauses can be marked only by the negative morpheme `-ji`, confirming its negation meaning.
4. **Paragraph 6** describes the `ji-caa` negation strategy, where the negative morpheme `-ji` is attached to the verb root, followed by tense and aspect information, and the negative particle `caa` follows the inflected verb.
5. **Paragraph 13** reiterates that in `ji-caa` negation, the negative morpheme `-ji` is attached to the verbal root, followed by tense and aspect information, and the negative particle `caa` follows the main verb.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negative morpheme `-ji` is an affix that attaches to the verb, marking negation. This affixation qualifies as a phonologically bound morpheme that modifies the verb to indicate negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Movima involves morphological modifications of the verb, specifically through nominalization and the use of negative particles. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Describes how the negative particle ""kas"" is used in main clauses, and the predicate is either nominalized or contains a negative element. Examples show verbs being nominalized with the suffix ""-wa"" (e.g., ""kas joro-wa=n"" for ""NEG sleep-NMZ=2"").

2. **Paragraph 2**: Further illustrates that the negative particle ""kas"" can be omitted if the context is clear, but the marker on the verb remains, indicating that the verb itself is modified for negation.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Reinforces that the particle ""kas"" forms a negative clause and the predicate is morphologically modified, typically through action nominalization with ""-wa"" or infixing reduplication.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions that in negative contexts, the irrealis marker <a’> functions as a marker of existential negation, which is another form of verb modification.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of nominalized verbs in negative clauses, showing that verbs are indeed modified for negation.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the use of the irrealis marker <a’> in negative contexts, further supporting that verbs are morphologically altered to express negation.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions that adjectives and other predicate nominals in negative clauses undergo infixing reduplication or receive the suffix ""-e"", indicating morphological changes.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Summarizes that negation in Movima involves particles and morphological modifications of the predicate, including nominalization and the use of negative markers.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Provides additional examples of verbs with the suffix ""-wa"" in negative contexts, showing that this is a common method of marking negation.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the suffix ""-ka"" and its use in indicating impossibility in negative contexts, further supporting the modification of verbs for negation.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions that negation involves morphological modifications of the predicate, including nominalization and the use of negative markers.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Describes partial nominalization in negative relative clauses, showing that verbs are modified for negation.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Provides examples of nominalized verbs in negative clauses, reinforcing that verbs are morphologically altered for negation.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the use of the suffix ""-e"" on adjectives in negative clauses, indicating morphological changes.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions that both nominalization and adnominal inalienable possession are marked by infixing reduplication, showing morphological changes in negative contexts.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Provides examples of adjectives with the suffix ""-e"" in negative clauses, indicating morphological changes.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the use of the suffix ""-e"" on adjectives in negative clauses, indicating morphological changes.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions that negation involves morphological modifications of the predicate, including nominalization and the use of negative markers.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Summarizes that negation in Movima involves particles and morphological modifications of the predicate, including nominalization and the use of negative markers.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Provides examples of coordinated clauses with negation, showing that verbs are modified for negation.

### Conclusion: 1

Standard negation in the language Movima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",0,1
Bora,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, it is evident that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix -thm (or its variants -tu, -tjhm) is used to indicate negation on verbs. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, as shown in multiple examples where it directly follows the verb root or stem.

For instance:
- In Paragraph 1, examples like ""akpakhmnm-thm-(nè)"" (yawn-neg-(n)) and ""a:hi§è-thé-thm-(nè)"" (eat-go.do-neg-(n)) clearly show the use of the suffix -thm for negation.
- Paragraph 3 further supports this with examples such as ""phé:-thm-nè"" (go-neg-(n)) and ""max$ho-thm-(nè)"" (eat-neg-(n)).
- Paragraph 6 also mentions that the morpheme -thm (or its variants) is suffixed to verbs in negative sentences, reinforcing the point that negation is marked by an affix.

These examples demonstrate that the negation marker forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined in the guidelines.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Wari',"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Wari'. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’ which can appear in simple sentences.
2. **Paragraph 4** describes the use of 'om ‘to not exist’ as a common way to express negation in COMP sentences.
3. **Paragraph 6** reiterates the use of 'om ‘to not exist’ as the leftmost member of a verb compound to express negation.
4. **Paragraph 13** provides an example of a verb with a negation marker: ""Cao''axiron"" (xira-oneatneg3s:irr-3sm) which translates to ‘He should not eat it.’
5. **Paragraph 15** outlines that sentence negation can be expressed using the verb 'om ‘to not exist’ in COMP sentences.
6. **Paragraph 17** discusses the postverbal modifier mao ‘negative’ used in indirect directives.

From these points, we can observe that Wari' employs several methods to mark negation:

- The use of the verb 'om ‘to not exist’ as a negation marker in verb compounds.
- The postverbal modifiers 'a/'ara and mao which attach to verbs to indicate negation.
- The example in Paragraph 13 shows a negation marker ""xira-oneatneg3s:irr-3sm"" attached to the verb.

These methods indicate that negation in Wari' can indeed be marked by affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. The presence of postverbal modifiers and the example of a negation marker attached to the verb support this conclusion.

**Reasoning:**
- The verb 'om ‘to not exist’ functions as a negation marker within verb compounds.
- Postverbal modifiers 'a/'ara and mao are used to mark negation and are phonologically bound to the verb.
- The example ""xira-oneatneg3s:irr-3sm"" demonstrates a negation marker attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Aymara (Central) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly mentions the use of a negative infix ""-tan"" in negative constructions. The example provided shows that the negative marker is affixed to the verb:
   - ""sarctanti"" (did not go)
   - ""sarapctanti"" (did not come)

2. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph also discusses the insertion of a negative marker ""-ti"" after the verb stem and plural infix, indicating that negation is marked by an affix:
   - ""sarapquirisclyutti"" (did not go)
   - ""sarcasamunti"" (did not come)

3. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph further supports the use of the negative suffix ""-ti"" in various verb forms, showing that negation is consistently marked by an affix:
   - ""sarcutanti"" (did not go)
   - ""sarapcuntanti"" (did not come)

These examples clearly show that negation in Aymara (Central) involves affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Trumai can be marked by a particle that follows the verb. Specifically, the negation particle ""tak"" is used to negate verbal predicates, and it follows the verb or the verb plus other elements such as auxiliaries. This is evident from multiple paragraphs, particularly Paragraph 4, which states:

> ""to negate verbal predicates, the Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as auxiliaries.""

Additionally, Paragraph 9 provides an example:

> (29) ami tak ka_in chi-n.
> speak Neg Foc/Tens Cop-3Abs
> ‘He is not speaking (now, for some reason not specified here).’

This indicates that the negation particle ""tak"" is phonologically bound to the verb, forming a unit with it. Therefore, standard negation in Trumai can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The negation particle ""tak"" is used to negate verbal predicates and follows the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. Multiple examples and descriptions confirm that ""tak"" is used in this manner, forming a phonological unit with the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Apinayé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Apinayé can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the clitic sequence ""ket=ne"" is used to negate both intransitive and transitive verbal predicates. This is clearly illustrated in the examples provided in Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3:

- Paragraph 1 mentions: ""Negation of intransitive (77-78) and transitive (79) verbal predicates is invariably encoded by the clitic sequence ket=ne.""
- Paragraph 3 provides examples such as:
  - ""pa kt paj ic-pikud ket=ne"" (I won’t get lost)
  - ""naEpa a-t- ket=ne"" (I didn’t dream about you)

These examples show that the negative marker ""ket=ne"" attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it, which qualifies as a clitic according to the guidelines provided.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the information to determine if standard negation in Yagua can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that negation, among other grammatical categories, may appear marked on the verb. This suggests that negation can be affixal or otherwise bound to the verb.
   
2. **Paragraph 11** provides an example of negation:
   ```
   Néé ryuvamyuuyjijita
   NEG 3PL-kill-COMPLT
   'They didn't kill the old lady.'
   ```
   Here, ""néé"" is a negative marker. However, it is not clear from this example alone whether ""néé"" is an affix, clitic, or a separate particle. The example shows it preceding the verb phrase, which could imply it is a particle, but this is not definitive without further context.

3. **Paragraph 16** lists ""NEG"" among other grammatical markers, but does not specify its attachment method.

### Reasoning:

- **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that negation can be marked on the verb, which implies the possibility of affixation or cliticization.
- **Paragraph 11** provides an example of negation but does not conclusively show the method of attachment.
- **Paragraph 16** lists negation as a grammatical marker but does not provide details on its attachment.

Given the information from **Paragraph 3**, it is reasonable to conclude that negation can be marked on the verb, which aligns with the criteria for coding 1.

### Conclusion:

1. The information from **Paragraph 3** indicates that negation can be marked on the verb.
2. Although **Paragraph 11** does not conclusively show the method of attachment, **Paragraph 3** provides sufficient evidence.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Cacua,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses negative imperative constructions and mentions the use of the suffix `-kabuhú` for negative imperatives. This indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that declarative clauses can express negative statements using the negation suffix `-kan` or `-kap`. Example (49) shows the use of `-kan` in a declarative clause:
   - ""kět=diʔ wã=ʔɨbʔ-kan=na=hĩ"" (I didn’t take them out).

3. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of negative interrogative clauses using the negation suffix `-kan`:
   - ""ma=beh-hí-kan=nit"" (aren’t you going?).
   - ""ma=beʔên-kan=nit"" (don’t you recognize?).

4. **Paragraph 7**: Reiterates the use of the negation suffix `-kan` in interrogative clauses:
   - ""ma=beh-hin-kan=nit"" (aren’t you going?).

5. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions that the negative existential verb `wîʔikan` is used to denote 'not to have or not to exist', and it is formed by the verb root `wîʔi-` and the negation suffix `-kan`.

6. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the use of the negation suffix `-kan` in imperative clauses:
   - ""ma=tîw-kabuhú"" (Don’t play!).

7. **Paragraph 18**: Provides a detailed verb template indicating that the negation suffix `-kan` occupies a specific position in the verb morphology.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Cacua can be marked by a suffix (`-kan` or `-kap`) that attaches to the verb. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking as defined in the guidelines.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The negative adverb **nish/nij** is used to negate verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, postpositional phrases, and auxiliaries.
   - Examples:
     - **nishbobo-ø=w=ya** (NEG hit;kill-3=PL=NVR) 'They did not kill him then.'
     - **nij an ti-tewe=la danda-y** (NEG DEM 1SG-foot=INS go.up-1SG.S) 'I did not go up by foot (but otherwise).'
   - The negative adverb **nish/nij** is placed before the verb phrase.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The negative adverb **nish/nij** is used in rhetorical questions to imply negation.
   - Examples:
     - **ama nish shiwwa-ø** (WH NEG lie-3) 'He was a liar alright!'

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - The prohibitive marker **-yu** is used for negative imperatives.
   - Examples:
     - **dele-yu** (fall:SG-PROH) 'Don’t fall!'
     - **pi-mu-winani-yu** (IMP.PL-3PL.CO-walk-PROH) 'Don’t live with the white folks.'

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The negative adverb **nish** is used before verbs to indicate negation.
   - Examples:
     - **nish bata-p pa-tewe=w=la** (NEG leave-2PL.S 2PL-foot=PL=INS) 'You are not going to go on foot.'

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - The non-veridical marker **=ya** is used in conjunction with negation.
   - Examples:
     - **nish ta-pasa-shta-ø=bëla ta-pasa=ya ta-jti-ø=w=ya** (NEG 1PL-happen.to-FUT-3=CNT 1PL-happen.to=NVR say-HAB-3=PL=NVR) '“Nothing is going to happen to us yet”, they said.'

From these points, it is clear that negation in Yuracare can be marked by the negative adverb **nish/nij** placed before the verb phrase. Additionally, the prohibitive marker **-yu** is used for negative imperatives, which is an affix. Therefore, standard negation in Yuracare can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Kuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Kuna can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 states:

""A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb. The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi.""

This clearly indicates that the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is used to negate verbs in declarative sentences, and it is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is explicitly described as being attached to the verb stem or following an aspect suffix, which means it forms a phonological unit with the verb.
2. The examples provided in the paragraph (e.g., ""An immal pakchul,"" ""An mol peichuli,"" ""An nan takchajul"") demonstrate the use of these suffixes directly attached to the verbs to indicate negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Uru,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Uru can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: The example ""ana-pini culu xala-m kuna-cu-cay"" shows the negation ""ana"" combined with the affirmative ""-pini"" and the declarative ""-cay"". The negation ""ana"" is inflected with clitics, indicating that it can be phonologically bound to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: The example ""ana-pini slekisini"" shows ""ana"" combined with ""-pini"", which is an affirmative clitic. This suggests that negation can be marked by clitics that are bound to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 3**: The example ""ana-pini piks-cay"" shows the negation ""ana"" combined with ""-pini"" and the declarative ""-cay"", further supporting that negation can be marked by clitics bound to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 6**: The example ""ana tulun kun-tani okwfaj-aki-cay"" shows the negation ""ana"" preceding the verb phrase and being combined with the declarative ""-cay"", indicating that negation can be bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 16**: The example ""ana k'asi tun-n-aki-cay"" shows the negation ""ana"" preceding the verb phrase and being combined with the declarative ""-cay"", indicating that negation can be bound to the verb.

These examples demonstrate that the negation ""ana"" can be combined with clitics such as ""-pini"" and ""-cay"", which are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** (9.3 Negation):
   - Negation in Camsá can be shown by the negator word ""ndoñ"" and/or verbal morphology.
   - The language can have negative verbal morphology and the negator ""ndoñ"" in the same clause.
   - Sometimes negation can be shown by verbal morphology without the negator ""ndoñ"".
   - The verbal morphology of negation is discussed in section 4.9.

2. **Paragraph 2** (9.3.2 Negating verbs):
   - Examples of negative verbal morphology include the prefix ""ke-"" and the additional prefix ""at-"" closer to the verb stem.
   - Example (10b) shows the verb with both the prefix ""ke-"" and the additional prefix ""at-"".

3. **Paragraph 3** (4.9.6 ndoñ with nt):
   - Sometimes negation is shown with the prefix ""nt-"" on the verb, without any person or number marking.
   - Examples (64a) and (64b) show verbs with the prefix ""nt-"" indicating negation.

4. **Paragraph 4** (4.9.1 ndoñ with ke- and at-):
   - A common way to negate verbs is to use the irrealis marker ""ke-"" which comes at the beginning of the word, preceding the subject marker, and ""at-"" which comes closer to the root, after the aspect markers.
   - Examples (60a) and (60c) show verbs with both prefixes ""ke-"" and ""at-"" indicating negation.

5. **Paragraph 5** (4.9.3 ndoñ with nd-):
   - Another way to show negation is with ""nd-"" instead of ""ke-"". Subject markers precede ""nd-"" and there is no ""at-"".
   - Examples (61a) and (61b) show verbs with the prefix ""nd-"" indicating negation.

6. **Paragraph 6** (4.9.4 ndoñ with n-):
   - Sometimes negation is shown with only ""n-"" on the verb.
   - Examples show different persons and numbers with ""n-"" indicating negation.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided, it is clear that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The prefixes ""ke-"", ""at-"", ""nt-"", ""nd-"", and ""n-"" are used to indicate negation directly on the verb. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Warao,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Warao can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 provide crucial information:

- Paragraph 2 states: ""Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG', whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker —naka 'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality overtly.""
- Paragraph 3 further illustrates this with examples: ""hirima nao -naka ta -te"" (Your father does not come) and ""ine namina -naka ta —bu -te"" (I really do not know).

These examples show that the negation marker -naka is suffixed directly to the verb root, indicating that negation in Warao is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Cuiba. The key information is found in Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 10.

Paragraph 7 mentions the verb clitic ""-yo"" as a negative marker:
-yo ‘negative’

Paragraph 10 provides examples of negation in declarative sentences:
Declarative Negative (20)
Cl21=‘C122=‘Cit/Intro: metha jei Rep 2: jei Neg:.jopa S: quéquere PP: na .P: jumichi
‘perhaps—yes—says-he—not—the-buzzard—other—said-he’
(The buzzard didn’t-say:perhaps:yes.)
Emb: bu Neg: jopa Oy: duhuei ‘O]: ca :P: huucayo
‘embarrassed—not—meat—you—begs-he’ :(He doesn’t beg-you for meat!)Ci23=Neg: jopa S: huaca ©): naca P: sinayo
‘not—the-bird—us—bite-he-not’ : (The bird doesn’t bite us.)Cl24=T: mataqueita Neg:-jopa P::ponayo
‘daylight-in—not—walks-he-not’ - (He doesn't come out in the daylight.)

From these examples, it is clear that the negative marker ""jopa"" is used in negation. However, the presence of the clitic ""-yo"" in Paragraph 7 indicates that negation can also be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraph 7 explicitly mentions a negative clitic ""-yo"" that attaches to the verb.
- Paragraph 10 provides examples of negation using ""jopa,"" but the presence of the clitic ""-yo"" suggests that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Apurinã,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Apurinã can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions ""morphological negation"" marked with the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" which attaches to verbs, as seen in the example ""m-areka-kati-nhi"" (NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT). This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 7 further supports this by describing the privative marker ""m(a)-"" which attaches to nominal or descriptive verb bases to indicate negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Kadiwéu. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that Kadiwéu has three different negation markers. One of them is a proclitic +aG that attaches to the verb of the main clause and has scope over the main clause exclusively. This indicates that the negation marker is phonologically bound to the verb.
   
   Example from Paragraph 2:
   - Pedro aG+y-ema:n:me medawi:
     - Pedro neg + 3sg.SUBJ-want COMP 3sg.SUBJ-theme-hunt
     - ‘Peter does not want to hunt.’

2. **Paragraph 5** provides another example where the negation marker aG+ is used:
   - Maria aG+y-d:-ati-qan-t+e-wa me y-el:wadi n-od:a-jo oqoqo:di
     - Mary neg + 3sg.SUBJ-theme-take-valency-rel + 3sg.CL-dative COMP 3sg.SUBJ-kill alibi-knife chicken
     - ‘Mary killed the chicken not with her knife.’

These examples clearly show that the negation marker aG+ is a proclitic that attaches to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.

### Reasoning:
- The negation marker +aG is described as a proclitic that attaches to the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.
- The examples provided show the negation marker directly attached to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for being considered an affix or clitic that marks standard negation.

### Conclusion:

Karajá,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Karajá can be marked by an affix. Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the basic negative morpheme in Karajá is ""-ko),"" which is suffixed to the verb to negate the entire sentence. This indicates that negation is achieved through a suffix that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with the verbal root. This suffixed negation marker meets the criteria for being considered an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Here is the relevant excerpt from Paragraph 1:
""There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates the entire sentence.""

This information is sufficient to determine that standard negation in Karajá can indeed be marked by an affix.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
