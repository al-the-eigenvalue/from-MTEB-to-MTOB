Supyire,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the negation strategies in Supyire. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Clause Final Negative Particles**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that there are two clause final negative particles, ""mä"" and ""mi"", which are used in declarative clauses.
   - Examples show these particles placed at the end of the clause, indicating negation.

2. **Negative Marking in Auxiliary Position**:
   - Paragraph 13 describes that negation in Supyire involves marking in the auxiliary position. This marking can be a low tone or the addition of the copula ""pye"" before the auxiliary.
   - Examples include the use of ""pye"" in front of the perfect or progressive auxiliary to signal negation early in the clause.

3. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that realis complements of manipulative verbs lose high tone marking in the negative, indicating a modification of the verb form in negative constructions.

4. **Affixes and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 13 also describes the use of a floating low tone that docks onto the auxiliary, which can be considered a form of affixation.
   - Paragraph 12 mentions a minor negative auxiliary marked with a negative low tone, suggesting another form of affixation.

Given these points, it is evident that Supyire employs multiple strategies for marking negation, including modifications of the verb (e.g., tone changes) and the use of affixes or clitics (e.g., the floating low tone and the copula ""pye"" in auxiliary positions).

### Reasoning:
- **Modification of the Verb**: The loss of high tone marking in negative constructions for realis complements indicates a modification of the verb.
- **Affix/Clitic**: The use of a floating low tone that docks onto the auxiliary and the addition of the copula ""pye"" before the auxiliary are forms of affixation or cliticization.

### Conclusion:
1

Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in the language Supyire can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Jamsay,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: It explicitly states that negation is expressed by verbal suffixation, with distinct negative suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs. Examples provided include ""bE$rE$-go@-w"" (be.able-ImpfNeg-2SgS) and ""ya$˘-li@˘-Ø"" (go-PerfNeg-1PlS), indicating the use of suffixes ""-go@"" and ""-li@"" for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides further examples of negative suffixes in use, such as ""lu$gu$ro$-jE$-lu@-m"" (I have not searched) and ""a$ƒa$-tE$-lu@-m"" (I have never heard), reinforcing the presence of suffixal negation.

- **Paragraph 4**: It discusses the categories expressed by negative verbs, mentioning the use of suffixes like ""-li@"" for perfective negative and ""-go@"" for imperfective negative, confirming the use of suffixes for negation.

- **Paragraph 7**: It mentions the suffix ""-go@"" as the usual negation for imperfective verbs, providing examples like ""de$ne$-go@-m"" (I don’t want) and ""sa$˘-go@-Ø"" (it will not respond).

- **Paragraph 8**: It describes the use of the suffix ""-li@"" for perfective negative verbs, with examples such as ""ya$˘-li@-Ø"" (he/she didn’t go).

These paragraphs collectively provide sufficient evidence that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ma'di can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions the use of ""kü"" and ""küru"" as negation particles. These particles are used to negate sentences and are phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in examples like ""Nò-rnù kü"" (don't go) and ""ö-mü kü"" (she will not go).

2. **Paragraph 5**: States that the verb is negated by a sentence-final negation word ""kü"" or ""küru"", and these negation words have a syntax similar to core modals. This indicates that the negation particles are phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 7**: Provides examples where ""kü"" and ""küru"" are used to negate verbs, such as ""mámû kü"" (I am not eating cassava) and ""mámû kûrù"" (I did not go). These examples show that the negation particles are directly associated with the verb.

4. **Paragraph 8**: Reiterates that ""kü"" can negate only an uninflected verb and provides examples like ""mapà gbánda kü"" (I am not eating cassava), showing the negation particle is bound to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 13**: Shows that the negation particles ""kü"" and ""küru"" are used with verbs, as in ""m-äwi dsóü kûrù"" (I did not open the door) and ""mámû kü"" (I am not eating cassava).

6. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions that ""kü"" is used in both verbal and non-verbal predicates, indicating its role as a negation particle bound to the verb or predicate.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that negation in Ma'di involves particles that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Bangime,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Bangime can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate that the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb and that there are suffixes such as [–r] and its allomorphs [r̃ ~ d ~ b] which are used in negated completive verb forms. For example, Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Transitive verbs in Class Two and Three take the [–r] suffix, or the [–d] allomorph, in the negative completive aspect."" Additionally, Paragraph 5 provides examples of verbs with the [–r] suffix in negative completive forms, such as ""bíé n déɛ̀bíè déɛ́–rè"" (lick) and ""bíé n nìèbíé nìɛ̀–rè"" (drink). This demonstrates that negation in Bangime involves modifications to the verb through affixation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Gumuz,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Gumuz can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions that in both NoG and parts of SoG (Kamashi), the negative clitic /=(a)ŋg̩ ó/ attaches to the end of the conjugated verb. This is illustrated in example (7.76), where the negative clitic =ŋgó is used to negate the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 4 provides further examples of the negative clitic =ŋgó attaching to verbs in sentences like ""á-a-ŋár-agá-kʼo=ŋgó"" and ""íi-a-kʼór-aká=cê"". 

These examples clearly show that the negative clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Koyra Chiini can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the forms ""sii"" and ""si"" as negations of ""goo"" and ""go,"" respectively, indicating that these are used as negative markers in the language.
2. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that ordinary (clause-internal) negation is expressed by morphemes such as ""si"" and ""sii,"" which are glossed as ""ImpfNeg"" and ""not-be,"" respectively. This suggests that these morphemes are used in a preverbal position to mark negation.
3. **Paragraph 14** discusses the subjunctive mood and mentions ""ma si"" as the negative counterpart of ""ma,"" indicating that ""si"" is used as a negation marker in this context as well.
4. **Paragraph 16** provides a table of MAN morphemes, where ""si"" is listed as ""ImpfNeg"" and ""na"" as ""Neg,"" showing that these morphemes are used to mark negation in different aspects and moods.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that negation in Koyra Chiini involves the use of specific morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as affixes or clitics.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Seme can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in the affirmative to S(Aux)OV in the negative. However, it also states that negative particles do not have such an effect, and the verbs appear uninflected in these cases.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** describes that imperfectives are negated by a particle, which does not cause a change in word order. This implies that the negation is marked by a particle rather than a modification of the verb itself.

3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples where negation is marked by a clause-final particle ""bo,"" which is not phonologically bound to the verb. This suggests that negation is not marked by an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 20** explicitly states that Siamou (a language related to Seme) uses a clause-final particle ""bo"" for negation, and there is no auxiliary/particle alternation or change in word order. This reinforces the idea that negation is marked by a particle rather than an affix or clitic.

Given the information in these paragraphs, it is clear that negation in Seme is marked by a particle that is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Seme cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Tima,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tima, it is clear that standard negation in Tima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It explicitly states that negation in declarative clauses involves two negative particles: the proclitic 'kV-' and the enclitic '-Vŋ'. These particles are phonologically bound to the verb. The examples provided show the negative markers attached to the verb forms, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 by explaining that Tima uses two obligatory negative particles, 'kV-' and '-Vŋ', in a negative sentence. These particles are described as external to the verb word but are still phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by their proclitic and enclitic nature.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph further illustrates the use of the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in negating verbs, showing that these particles harmonize with the verb root and are necessary for forming negative constructions.

4. **Paragraph 4**: It mentions that Tima uses different strategies for negation, including the use of the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in a single clause, especially for negating declarative and imperative clauses.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of perfective negation using the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ', showing their attachment to the verb forms.

6. **Paragraph 7**: Describes the use of the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in imperative and subjunctive forms, indicating their phonological binding to the verb.

7. **Paragraph 8**: Shows the structure of negative imperative and subjunctive forms, again illustrating the use of the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' attached to the verb.

8. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the use of the negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in negating perfective and imperfective aspects, further confirming their role in verb negation.

9. **Paragraph 18**: Provides a detailed structure of the Tima verb-stem, showing the slots for the negative markers 'kV-' and '-Vŋ', indicating their integration into the verb morphology.

Given this consistent evidence across multiple paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
!Xun (Ekoka),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that verbs in !Xun can be negated by the proclitic *l6a. This indicates that negation is marked by a proclitic, which is a type of clitic that attaches to the beginning of a word and is phonologically bound to it.

2. **Paragraph 10** further supports this by stating that verbal negation is fairly uniform across all dialects and involves the use of proclitics. Specifically, it mentions that the negation markers are proclitics when there is a verb, and the general negation marker *l6a is placed between the subject and the verb.

3. **Paragraph 13** provides a table summarizing the main constituents of the verb phrase in various dialects, including the placement of negation markers. It confirms that negation markers (NEG) are placed between the subject and the verb, indicating that they are indeed phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) can be marked by a proclitic (*l6a) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The negation marker *l6a is described as a proclitic, which is a type of clitic that attaches to the verb.
- The placement of the negation marker between the subject and the verb, as described in the paragraphs, indicates that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Katcha,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, there is evidence that standard negation in Katcha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 12 mentions passive morphology and how it affects the interpretation of verbs, indicating that verb morphology plays a role in altering the meaning of verbs. Additionally, Paragraph 13 discusses the role of demonstrative pronouns in relative clauses, which suggests that Katcha uses morphological markers to modify verbs and clauses. These examples imply that Katcha employs morphological changes to verbs, which could include negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ijo (Kolokuma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Ijo (Kolokuma) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3 provides clear evidence that negation is marked by the introduction of the marker ""-a"" between the last verb and the aspect marker. This indicates that negation is achieved through a modification of the verb form itself, which aligns with the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Here are the relevant excerpts from Paragraph 3:
- ""Sentences are made negative by the introduction of the marker -a between the last verb and the aspect marker; considerable re-ordering of the aspect markers takes place as a result (M.62).""
- Examples provided include:
  - ""a b6-a"" (she did not come)
  - ""a b6-a"" (she is not coming)
  - ""a b6-a, fa-qjmi"" (she will not come)

These examples clearly show that the negation marker ""-a"" is attached to the verb, thereby modifying it to express negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Emai. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that Emai has segmental morphemes for negative aspect, including Perfect Negation (ì), Prospective Negation (khà), and Past Absolute Negation (yà).
   - These negative aspects are inflectional categories that precede the verb.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It provides examples of negative constructions:
     - Perfect Negation: ""ó ì è ólí émàè"" (he NEG eat food) translates to ""He did not eat food.""
     - Prospective Negation: ""ó khà è ólí émàè"" (he PRONEG eat the food) translates to ""He will not eat the food.""
     - Past Absolute Negation: ""ó yà shèn úkpùn"" (he PANEG sell cloth) translates to ""He never sells cloth.""
   - These examples show that the negative morphemes (ì, khà, yà) are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by an affix or clitic.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - It discusses sentence negation (SN) constructions framed by clause initial ""ki,"" which negates an entire proposition.
   - Example: ""kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì?"" (SN the woman PAP.know-F) translates to ""Isn't it the case that the woman knew?""

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - It mentions that clauses within disjunctive constructions can express negative polarity using Perfect Negation (ì) and Prospective Negation (khà).

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The negative morphemes (ì, khà, yà) attach directly to the verb, modifying it to express negation.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ik,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ik involves the use of negator verbs (e.g., ńt-, ma-/na-) that appear in the clause-initial slot and are marked for modality (realis or irrealis). These negator verbs are phonologically bound to the verb they negate, as they take modal suffixes and can be modified by tense enclitics. Additionally, the negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood (or realis mood for prohibitives) as a complement clause.

Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Negator Verbs and Modal Suffixes**: Paragraphs 2 and 3 explain that negation in Ik is signaled by negator verbs that take modal suffixes (e.g., realis {-a} and sequential {-(k)ɔ}). These negator verbs fill the clause-initial slot and are treated as the main verb of the clause.
   
2. **Phonological Binding**: The negator verbs are phonologically bound to the verb they negate. For example, the negator ma-/na- can be modified by tense enclitics, which only modify the clause predicate (Paragraph 2).

3. **Examples of Negation**: Paragraphs 3 and 5 provide examples such as ""Nta ƙod"" (ńt-áƙó-dⁱ) and ""Maa naa ƙod"" (má-á=naaƙó-dⁱ), where the negator verb is clearly marked with a modal suffix and is phonologically bound to the main verb.

Given these points, it is evident that standard negation in Ik can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Ngiti,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 provides clear evidence that the negative marker ""inza"" (or its shortened form ""nza"") is used in conjunction with the verb to indicate negation. The examples given show that the negative marker can be placed immediately following the conjugated verb or auxiliary verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, the negative marker does not cause any changes in tone on the verb forms, further suggesting that it functions as an affix or clitic.

For instance, the sentence ""I have not cultivated the field"" is given as ""inzi ma m-dbhi"" where ""inzi"" is the negative marker. This demonstrates that the negation is directly associated with the verb phrase.

Paragraph 5 also supports this by explaining the position and forms of negative markers, indicating that they can be used non-initially and are often shortened when not in the initial position, which is a characteristic of clitics.

Therefore, the evidence strongly supports that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Sidaama,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Sidaama can be marked by both affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically:

- Paragraph 3 mentions the negative suffix ""-kki"" which attaches to the verb in subordinate clauses to indicate negation.
- Paragraph 5 further elaborates on the negative suffix ""-kki"" and its usage in negating verbs in relative clauses and other subordinate clauses.
- Paragraph 7 provides examples of the negative proclitic ""di="" which attaches to verbs to negate them.
- Paragraph 10 and Paragraph 14 also provide examples of the negative clitic ""di="" attaching to verbs to negate them in various contexts.

These examples demonstrate that Sidaama uses both affixes (e.g., ""-kki"") and clitics (e.g., ""di="") that are phonologically bound to the verb to mark standard negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Mursi can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that verbs in the imperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó] and verbs in the perfective aspect by the negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root.
   - **Paragraph 10**: It describes the use of circumclitics for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect, specifically using the structure ŋà=VERB.ROOT=ó.
   - **Paragraph 7**: It provides examples of the negator clitics occurring on both sides of the verbal predicate, indicating that the negative clitics attach only to the verb.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: It also mentions the use of a k(V)- prefix when negating a perfective verb to refer to the first person subject.
   - **Paragraph 13**: It describes the formation of negative imperative clauses using the imperfective verb root preceded by the negative imperfective proclitic ŋà= followed by singular or plural imperative suffixes.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples like ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-i=ó for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect.
   - **Paragraph 13**: Shows examples of negative imperatives such as ŋà=éʤ-í (NEG.IMPERV=shoot.IMPERV-SG) for ""Don't (sg.) shoot/kill!""

These points collectively demonstrate that Mursi employs affixes, clitics, and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Majang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Majang involves the use of a negative auxiliary ""k-"" that precedes the negative verb forms. These negative verb forms are marked with specific suffixes such as ""-ɛːt,"" ""-iːt,"" ""-ɛːɗ,"" and ""-iːɗ,"" among others. The negative auxiliary itself is inflected for person and number, and it is phonologically bound to the verb it negates.

Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of a fully inflectable auxiliary ""k-"" for creating negative sentences, which precedes the negative verb forms.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of the negative auxiliary with direction markings, showing that the auxiliary is inflected for person and number.
3. **Paragraph 6** further illustrates the use of the negative auxiliary with additional inflections.
4. **Paragraph 15** explicitly states that the negative auxiliary ""k-"" is needed to precede the negative verb forms, which are unchanged for all persons.
5. **Paragraph 18** discusses the formation of negative verb forms, indicating that these forms are derived from the infinitive forms of verbs and are marked with specific suffixes.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Majang can be marked by an affix (the negative auxiliary ""k-"") that is phonologically bound to the verb, as well as by modifications of the verb itself (negative verb forms with specific suffixes).

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Birri,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Birri can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative particle ""sa"" (or its variants ""ca"" and ""sha"") is consistently placed at the end of negative statements, which indicates that it is phonologically bound to the verb. This is evident in several examples:

- Paragraph 3: ""I am not Birri"" is translated as ""amd viri sa.""
- Paragraph 8: ""They are not many"" is translated as ""atyone sha.""
- Paragraph 9: ""I have not"" is translated as ""ana gama Bd-sa.""
- Paragraph 14: ""I do not eat"" is translated as ""monyo (e)de-sha.""

These examples demonstrate that the negative particle ""sa"" attaches to the verb, marking negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Tamashek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tamashek can be marked by modifications of the verb or by affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of a special LoImpfN stem for the imperfective negative construction, which involves blocking certain phonological features and applying a strict melody. This indicates a modification of the verb stem for negation.
- **Paragraph 2** further elaborates on the modifications in the perfective and imperfective forms when negated. For instance, in the perfective, the verb stem undergoes a vocalic substitution (ablaut) to form the PerfN (perfective negative) stem.
- **Paragraph 10** confirms that the PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding an ablaut formative, which is a modification of the verb stem.
- **Paragraph 19** provides examples of negative participles where the verb form is modified to indicate negation, such as the use of the PerfN form.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that Tamashek employs verb modifications (ablaut changes) to mark standard negation, fulfilling the criteria for marking negation through modifications of the verb or phonologically bound affixes/clitics.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Coptic,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Coptic employs several strategies for negation, including the use of affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides examples of negative forms where negation is marked by prefixes and suffixes attached to the verb. For instance, ""N-q-NA-CWTM AN"" (he is not going to hear) and ""N-€-G-NaA-CWTM AN"" (he is not going to hear) show the use of the prefix ""N-"" and the suffix ""AN"" to mark negation.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the syntactically discontinuous negation ""N- ... aN,"" where ""N-"" is a clause-initial particle and ""aN"" is a clause-internal negation adverb. This indicates that negation involves elements that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 3**: It mentions the use of double negation ""N- ... an,"" which involves two negative elements that together constitute a single instance of negation. This further supports the presence of phonologically bound negation markers.

- **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph explicitly states that all negative tenses are marked by a morpheme-initial labial or velar nasal ""w-"" or ""N-,"" indicating that negation is marked by prefixes attached to the verb.

- **Paragraph 18**: It reiterates that negative tenses in Coptic are marked by a morpheme-initial labial or velar nasal ""w-"" or ""N-,"" confirming the use of affixes for negation.

These examples clearly show that standard negation in Coptic can be marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Igbo can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that negation markers are marked on the first verb, indicating that negation is directly associated with the verb.
2. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states the use of a suffix negator ""=ghi"" and a negative prefix ""A-"" on the verb, which are clear examples of affixes used for negation.
3. **Paragraph 16** provides an example of a negative sentence where the verb ""jighì"" includes the negative suffix ""=ghI"".
4. **Paragraph 17** further confirms that the negative counterpart of affirmative assertions is realized by the affixation of the general negative suffix ""=ghI"" to the auxiliary verb or main verb.

These pieces of evidence collectively indicate that standard negation in Igbo involves the use of affixes or modifications directly on the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mambai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the language uses negative particles such as ""yá"" and ""gá"" that are phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by their placement and behavior in the examples. Additionally, the negative subject pronouns exhibit a CVV structure that is distinct from their affirmative counterparts, indicating a modification of the verb form for negation.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, it is mentioned that ""There are two negation particles used with verbs: yá and gá."" The examples provided show these particles being used in conjunction with verbs to indicate negation. For example:
- ""míì làà yá"" (1SG:NONPFV.NEG eat:VN NEG) translates to ""I am not eating something.""

Paragraph 3 further supports this by showing that negative subject pronouns are used in conjunction with these particles to mark negation:
- ""míì héérà yá"" (1SG:NONPFV.NEG climb:VN NEG) translates to ""I do not climb / I am not climbing.""

Paragraph 5 also reinforces this by stating that ""Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some additional indicator.""

These examples demonstrate that negation in Mambai involves both the use of negative particles that are phonologically bound to the verb and modifications to the verb form itself through negative subject pronouns.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ingessana,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingessana is marked by the clause-final particle ""wá,"" which does not attach to the verb or any other word in the clause. This particle is used to negate the entire clause and is not phonologically bound to the verb or any other constituent.

2. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negation particle ""wá"" stands alone and is not attached to the verb or any other word.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Gorowa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Gorowa can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 describes the use of the negative clitic =ká(ng), which attaches to verb roots extended by the suffix -a in the present tense and -i in the past tense. This clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, as evidenced by the examples given:

- In the present tense: ""tam motloo ngi xu’aká"" (she doesn’t even know tomorrow)
- In the past tense: ""inós tunáy ngu xu’iká’"" (she didn’t know of dried honey)

These examples demonstrate that the negative clitic =ká(ng) attaches directly to the verb, indicating that standard negation can indeed be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Shatt,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Shatt can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph mentions that locating near suffixes can be on verbs to show the action is near the speaker. Specifically, it states, ""Locating near suffixes can also be on verbs to show the action is near the speaker."" This indicates that verbs in Shatt can take suffixes, which implies that other types of suffixes, including those for negation, could also attach to verbs.

2. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph lists various verb forms and includes examples of verbs with different suffixes. It shows that verbs can take multiple suffixes to indicate different grammatical aspects, such as ""-dawa,"" ""-dasa,"" and ""-atäsa."" This suggests that verbs in Shatt are morphologically complex and can take affixes, which could include negation markers.

3. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the use of suffixes to connect descriptive relative clauses to nouns. It shows that the language uses suffixes extensively to modify verbs and nouns, indicating a high likelihood that negation could also be marked by a suffix.

4. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples of complement suffixes (enclitics) that can be attached to nouns and verbs. It shows that verbs can take suffixes to form complete sentences, further supporting the idea that negation could be marked by a suffix.

Given this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Shatt can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Koromfe,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 2** mentions that a sentence can be negated either with the negative particle ""ba"" positioned before the verb or by using a negative subject pronoun from a list of proclitics on the verb. This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 3** provides an example where the negative particle ""ba"" and negative personal pronouns are used. It also mentions that a negative personal pronoun shortens the long final ""aa"" of a following progressive verb form, indicating a modification of the verb in the presence of negation.
- **Paragraph 18** discusses the existence of negative prefixal pronouns that can only be used as the prefixed subject of a verb, giving the verb a negated reading. This further supports the use of clitics for negation.
- **Paragraph 19** mentions the negative counterpart of the verb ""WE"" as ""1)go"" or ""1)gose,"" which must be used instead of the positive verb ""WE"" when negation is involved. This indicates a modification of the verb for negation.

Given these points, it is evident that Koromfe employs affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nobiin,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nobiin can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 6 mentions the insertion of the element -min/-muun- between the verbal base and the ending to form the negative present tense. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 4 describes the use of the negative auxiliary men-/min- in periphrastic constructions, which further supports the presence of bound morphemes in negation.

**Reasoning:**
- **Paragraph 6:** Clearly states that the element -min/-muun- is inserted between the verbal base and the ending to form the negative present tense. This is a direct modification of the verb to indicate negation.
- **Paragraph 4:** Describes the use of the negative auxiliary men-/min- in periphrastic constructions, showing that negation involves a bound morpheme attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Nyimang. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the use of `fa` in negative sentences: ""a fa wo, do not know"", ""endu fa kil, He does not understand"".
2. **Paragraph 3** also shows the use of `fa` preceding the verb for negation: ""endu fa kil, He does not understand"".
3. **Paragraph 9** provides examples of negation using `fa`: ""a fa tai, I am not going"", ""endu furo fa n;;on, She is not carrying a basket"".

From these examples, it is clear that the particle `fa` is used to mark negation in Nyimang. This particle precedes the verb and is not attached to it as an affix or clitic. Instead, it functions as a separate word.

Given the requirement that standard negation must be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb, and considering that `fa` is a separate particle, we conclude that standard negation in Nyimang is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The negation particle `fa` is used as a separate word preceding the verb.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Lamé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language Lamé. The key paragraphs that provide relevant information are Paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 13. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 3**:
   - These paragraphs describe the means of negating verbal and verbless indicative clauses in Pévé (which is used interchangeably with Lamé in this context). They state that all attested negative clauses are marked by the negative particle ""mì"" in clause-final position and that in most negative clauses, this marker is accompanied by the negative particle ""tsú,"" which follows the subject noun or pronoun and precedes the verb.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of negative clauses in various aspects and tenses. It shows that the negative marker ""tsú"" appears immediately after the subject noun or pronoun, and the negative marker ""mì"" appears at the end of the clause. For example:
     - ""Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə̀ bə̀kà mì"" (Tau didn’t go to the market this morning)
     - ""Tá tsú gí tsoɓ mbìr mì"" (She does not sell milk)

3. **Paragraph 13**:
   - This paragraph reiterates that negation in Pévé is marked by the negative marker ""tsú"" immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative marker ""mì"" at the end of the clause. It also mentions that the marker ""tsú"" can be omitted only if the negative clause is a response to a question.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the standard negation in Lamé involves the use of the negative markers ""tsú"" and ""mì."" The marker ""tsú"" follows the subject and precedes the verb, while ""mì"" is placed at the end of the clause. This indicates that negation is not marked by a modification of the verb itself but by the addition of these negative particles.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, standard negation in Lamé cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, it is marked by separate negative particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Bininj Gun-Wok,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Bininj Gun-Wok can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

2. The evidence for this conclusion comes from several examples in the provided text:

- Paragraph 2 discusses the negative particles used in different dialects of Bininj Gun-Wok, such as ""djama"" and ""marrek"". These particles are placed immediately before the verb to indicate negation. For example, ""marrek birri-ngu-yi"" (NEG 3a/3-eat-IRR) means ""They didn’t eat it.""

- Paragraph 13.9.2 mentions that negation in indicatives and interrogatives is signaled by a negative particle placed before the verb. This is a clear indication of a clitic or particle used for negation.

- Paragraph 13.9.1 discusses the use of negative interjections like ""burrkyak"" and ""kayakki,"" which are used to mean 'no' or 'nothing'. These interjections can stand alone or be followed by a negative statement, further supporting the use of particles for negation.

- Paragraph 13.9.3 provides examples of negation in imperatives, showing the use of negative particles like ""djama"" and ""marrek"" combined with verbs in the irrealis form to indicate negation.

- Paragraph 13.9.4 discusses negation in existentials, where a privative-suffixed noun is used as a nominal predicate, indicating another method of negation through affixation.

- Paragraph 13.9.5 and 13.9.6 discuss negative pronouns and referent negation, respectively, further illustrating the use of negative particles and affixes in different contexts.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Wambaya,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Wambaya can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**: Paragraphs 4, 5, and 9 provide examples where negation involves the use of particles like ""yangula"" and ""guyala"" which interact with the auxiliary verbs. Specifically, these particles require the auxiliary to take on certain suffixes, such as the hypothetical suffix in future tense clauses (e.g., ""yangula irr-agba jiyawu"" where ""irr-agba"" is the auxiliary with the hypothetical suffix). This indicates that negation affects the verb form through the auxiliary.

2. **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 8 shows an example of a negative imperative construction where the verb appears without future tense marking due to the presence of the negative imperative particle ""alyu"" (e.g., ""Alyu junmi/junmi-j-ba!"" meaning ""Don't cut it!""). This demonstrates that the verb form is directly modified in the context of negation.

3. **Bound Morphemes**: Paragraph 10 provides an example where the negative particle ""yangula"" is used with a simple future tense suffix ""-u"" (e.g., ""Yangula ngu-ny-u daguma"" meaning ""I'm not going to hit you""). This shows that the negation particle can co-occur with verb suffixes, indicating a bound morpheme relationship.

Given these examples, it is clear that standard negation in Wambaya can involve affixes, clitics, or modifications to the verb form.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Wardaman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points relevant to determining whether standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the negative particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" are clausal negators that generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb or before a particle plus finite verb combination. This suggests that negation is typically achieved through the use of these particles rather than through affixes or clitics attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences where ""wonggo"" is used as a negator. In these examples, ""wonggo"" appears as a separate word preceding the verb, indicating that it functions as a particle rather than an affix or clitic.

3. **Paragraph 3** further illustrates the use of ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" as negators. The examples show these particles preceding the verb or nominal phrases, reinforcing the idea that negation is achieved through particles rather than modifications to the verb itself.

4. **Paragraph 7** discusses the relationship between negative forms of the verb and irrealis mood, stating that negations of indicative predications are not irrealis and are negated with the particles ""wonggo"" or ""warna."" This again points to the use of particles for negation.

5. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of negative imperative constructions using ""wonggo"" with irrealis forms of the verb. The negation is still marked by the particle ""wonggo"" rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

From these observations, it is clear that standard negation in Wardaman is primarily marked by the use of negative particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" that precede the verb or nominal phrase. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

**Reasoning:**
The provided paragraphs consistently show that negation in Wardaman is achieved through the use of separate negative particles (""wonggo"" and ""warna"") that precede the verb or nominal phrase. There is no indication that negation is marked by affixes, clitics, or modifications to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Gooniyandi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Gooniyandi can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The key evidence comes from several examples where the negation is directly associated with the verb phrase. For instance:

- Paragraph 5: The example (6-113) shows the use of ""mangaddi"" (not) in a clause where it modifies the verb phrase: ""yaadi-yarndi ngarloodoo threemangaddi girili-ya-nyali mangaddi warayaddi"" ('We didn't stand by that tree again'). Here, ""mangaddi"" is used to negate the verb phrase.
  
- Paragraph 13: The example (6-237) ""mangaddi yoodgoowali"" ('I haven't put it down') shows ""mangaddi"" directly modifying the verb ""yoodgoowali"" (I:was:putting:it), indicating that the negation is applied to the verb phrase.

- Paragraph 17: The example (6-276) ""mangaddi wardgaddoo-woo"" ('We won't go') shows ""mangaddi"" negating the verb phrase ""wardgaddoo-woo"" (we:go DEF), indicating that the negation is applied to the verb phrase.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Gooniyandi can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Tiwi. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The negative particle ""kalu"" (or ""karluwu"") is used for negation in declarative sentences.
   - Example: ""arra kalu pilipim yi-mihe"" translates to ""He didn't obey (him).""
   - The negative particle ""kalu"" is inserted before the verb or verbal complex.
   - There is no mention of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation in this paragraph.

**Conclusion: 0**",0,0
Nakkara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nakkara, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Nakkara can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph introduces the negative particle ""korla"" which precedes the verb in negative constructions. It also mentions that the morphology of negative verb forms is discussed in detail in section 5.4.1. Examples provided show ""korla"" preceding the verb complex, indicating its role in negation.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the use of the palatal segment /*y/ and the negative affix /-ma/ in irrealis and negative verb forms. It specifies that the negative marker /-ma/ follows the verb stem in the tense suffix slot of the verb complex. Examples such as ""korla ngaybburdama"" and ""korla yawaramama"" illustrate the use of /-ma/ as a negative suffix.

3. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph further elaborates on the use of the negative prefix /ka/ and the negative suffix /-ma/ in contemporary and future negative constructions. It provides examples of negative constructions where these affixes are used.

4. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph explains the structure of irrealis verb forms, including negative constructions, which involve the negative prefix /ka/, the irrealis slot /*y/, and the negative suffix /-ma/.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Nakkara uses both a negative prefix (/ka/) and a negative suffix (/-ma/) to mark standard negation in verb forms. Therefore, standard negation in Nakkara can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Garrwa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically:

- Paragraph 2 mentions that in negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form with the suffix ""-kanyi"" (e.g., ""jilaj-kanyi"" for ""walk-irr"" in the sentence ""I’m not going"").
- Paragraph 7 provides multiple examples where the negative particle ""miku"" is used in conjunction with the irrealis verb form ""-kanyi"" (e.g., ""maduj-kanyi"" for ""be.cold-irr"" in ""That water’s not cold"").
- Paragraph 7 also shows the use of clitics such as ""=yanyi"" for past negation (e.g., ""yali=yanyi"" for ""3plnom=past.neg"" in ""They didn’t kill it"").
- Paragraph 7 further illustrates the use of the clitic ""=yi"" for negating ability (e.g., ""ngayi=yi"" for ""1sgnom=neg.abil"" in ""I can’t walk"").

These examples demonstrate that negation in Garrwa involves modifications to the verb through suffixes and the use of clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ngankikurungkurr,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the negative particle ""minbe/minde(K)"" can attract verbal enclitics such as the temporal focus marker -nyine/-kana(K) and the past and future tense markers -tye and -pe/-ngini(K). This indicates that the negative particle can be phonologically bound to the verb through these enclitics.

2. **Paragraph 6** describes prohibitives structured with the pre-verbal negative particle ""minbe/minde(K)"" and mentions that prohibitives appeal to the authority of legal, social, or ritual norms. This shows that the negative particle is used in a construction that involves the verb.

3. **Paragraph 16** reiterates the use of the negative particle ""minbe/minde(K)"" combined with generic terms, giving the privative sense of 'the absence of a member of class X'. This further supports the use of a negative particle in verbal constructions.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negative particle ""minbe/minde(K)"" is used in conjunction with verbs and can attract verbal enclitics, indicating that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr involves elements that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Wagiman,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Wagiman. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of ""wudyi"" as the usual sentential negator, which occurs in clause-initial position. This suggests that negation is marked by a separate word (particle) rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb. Examples provided in this paragraph show ""wudyi"" preceding the verb, indicating it is not phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss the use of the nominal privative suffix ""-ne'en"" for negative imperative constructions. However, this is specific to participles and not general declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negation in imperative sentences using ""dyamba"" (IRR NEG), which also appears to be a separate word rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 12** confirms that adverbs like ""dyamba"" and ""wudyi"" are used for negation, further supporting that these are separate words and not bound morphemes.

Given the information from these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Wagiman is marked by separate words (particles) rather than affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), we can analyze the methods of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Negation with Prefixes**: 
   - The particle **la** is used as a negator and can combine with pre-verbal particles like **""i-** and **q6m-**. For example:
     - **le-y-pal6†** (NEG-IND-leave) 'He does not leave'
     - **l5-pal6†** (NEG-leave) 'He does not leave'
     - **la-y-áx6l** (NEG-IND-eat) 'He does not eat'
     - **l5-y-áx6l** (NEG-eat) 'He does not eat'
   - These examples show that the negator **la** can attach to the verb or a pre-verbal particle, modifying the verb form to indicate negation.

2. **Negation with Clitics**:
   - The negator **la** can combine with the particle **""i-**, which sometimes results in forms like **le-y-** or **l5-**. This indicates that the negator can be phonologically bound to the verb or the pre-verbal particle, acting as a clitic.

3. **Negation of the Copula**:
   - The present and past copula can be negated by prefixing **la**. For example:
     - **l7le** (NEG-COP) 'He is not'
     - **l7wa** (NEG-COP.PAST) 'He was not'
   - This shows that the negator **la** directly modifies the copula, which is a form of verb modification.

4. **Negation of Compound Verbal Forms**:
   - Compound verbal forms involving the copula and resultative participle or infinitive are negated by replacing the positive copula with the negative copula:
     - **l7le príqa** (NEG-COP finish.PTCP) 'He has not finished'
     - **l7wa príqa** (NEG-COP.PAST finish.PTCP) 'He had not finished'

5. **Negation of the Verb 'to know'**:
   - The verb 'to know' when negated can exhibit contraction or replacement of the first syllable:
     - **l5ð6n** (NEG-know) 'I do not know'
     - **mið6n** (NEG.know) 'I do not know'

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negator **la** can attach to verbs or pre-verbal particles, and it can modify the verb form to indicate negation.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
English,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in English can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 17 discusses primary verbal negation and provides examples of both analytic and synthetic primary negation. The synthetic primary negation is marked by the contraction of ""not"" with the auxiliary verb, forming negative verb-forms such as ""won't"" (will not) and ""didn't"" (did not). These contractions are examples of clitics, as they are phonologically bound to the verb.

For instance:
- ""Kim will not be here later on."" (analytic primary negation)
- ""Kim won’t be here later on."" (synthetic primary negation)

Similarly:
- ""Kim did not wave to us."" (analytic primary negation)
- ""Kim didn’t wave to us."" (synthetic primary negation)

These examples clearly show that negation in English can be marked by a clitic (e.g., ""n’t"") that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Korean,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korean can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the short (or simple) negative and the long (or complex) negative forms, indicating that negation can be directly applied to verbs.
- **Paragraph 2** explains that the short negative directly negates the verb phrase, which implies a modification of the verb.
- **Paragraph 4** mentions the short negative form ""an"" (or ""ani"") and how it is used with verbs and adjectives.
- **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of negative adverbs like ""an"" and ""mos"" which are placed before the verb, indicating a modification of the verb.
- **Paragraph 6** provides examples of negative forms like ""acik an /mOs V-ess.ta"" which show the negation being applied to the verb.
- **Paragraph 9** explains the use of double negatives and how they modify the verb phrase.
- **Paragraph 11** discusses the placement of ""mos"" in relation to verbal nouns, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

These points collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Korean involves modifications of the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Basque,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Basque involves the use of the negative particle ""ez"" which precedes the auxiliary verb. This is shown in multiple examples where ""ez"" is used to negate sentences, such as:

- (1072) a. Ez da inor etorri. ('Nobody came.')
- (1072) b. Ez du inork erosi. ('Nobody bought it.')
- (1177) Ia inor ez da etorri. ('Almost nobody came.')
- (1178) Ez da ia inor etorri. ('Almost nobody came.')

These examples demonstrate that the negation is marked by the particle ""ez"" which is phonologically bound to the auxiliary verb. The particle ""ez"" is not a separate word but a bound morpheme that attaches to the verb, indicating that negation in Basque can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Malayalam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that the suffix ""-§•»"" is added to the verb form, indicating some sort of emphasis and restriction. This suggests that suffixes can be attached to verbs in Malayalam.
   
2. **Paragraph 4**: States that for the negative copula verb, ""sraioo/lflBanro"" is suffixed to the verb. This indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that negative statements take the suffix ""-^B-^"" for interrogation, which implies that suffixes are used in negative constructions.

4. **Paragraph 12**: Clearly states that negation is formed by the addition of ""ie§y"" after the tense marker, and that when it is added, the final ""-§"" of ""-S0™"" becomes zero. This indicates that negation involves a suffix attached to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 15**: States that negative verbal adjectives are formed by the addition of ""—(3Ta>roro>"" to the verb-stem, indicating the use of suffixes for negation.

6. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the formation of negative imperatives by adding the suffix ""-sne"" to the verb stem, further supporting the use of suffixes for negation.

Given these pieces of evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mien is marked by the particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv,"" which are placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs. There is no indication that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

Here is the reasoning based on the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It states that negation is marked by the particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv,"" which is placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs.
2. **Paragraph 4**: It reiterates that negation is marked by the negative particle ""maiv"" or its contraction ""mv"" placed immediately before the verbals.
3. **Paragraph 10**: It discusses the use of the negative particles ""maiv"" and ""mv"" in double negation constructions, but still as separate particles placed before verbs.
4. **Paragraph 17**: It confirms that verbs and adjectival verbs can be negated by the particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv.""

None of these paragraphs provide evidence that negation in Mien involves an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, negation is consistently described as being marked by a separate particle placed before the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Semelai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions the negative imperative marker ""boy 'NEG:IMP'"" which attaches to the verb in negative imperative constructions. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic in imperative contexts.
   - Paragraph 10 further supports this by describing how the imperative negator ""boy 'NEG:IMP'"" is followed by the verb and can host the irrealis proclitic ""ma= 'IRR'"". This shows that negation involves morphological marking directly on the verb.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 19 provides an example of a negative imperative construction with ""boy 'NEG:IMP'"" followed by the verb, indicating that the verb itself is modified in the process of negation.

3. **Negation in Declarative Sentences**:
   - Paragraph 9 lists ""da? 'NEG'"" as a propositional negator. While this paragraph does not explicitly state that ""da?"" attaches to the verb, the context of its usage in other paragraphs suggests it functions as an internal negator within the clause, likely modifying the verb or being closely associated with it.

Given these points, it is clear that Semelai uses affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb to mark negation in various contexts, including standard negation in declarative sentences.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yukaghir (Kolyma) can be marked by a prefix attached to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 states: ""The standard sentential negation is expressed by attaching the prefix e/+ to the finite verb, as illustrated by (857) and many other examples in this grammar."" This indicates that the negative marker is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking negation via an affix or modification of the verb.

Additionally, several examples throughout the paragraphs illustrate the use of this prefix with verbs, such as:
- ""el+jan-ni"" (NEG+send-3PL:INTR) in Paragraph 5.
- ""el+kes ‘i-je"" (NEG+bring-INTR:2PL) in Paragraph 7.
- ""el+modo-jil"" (NEG+live-INTR:1PL) in Paragraph 8.

These examples confirm that the negative prefix ""el+"" is consistently used with verbs to mark negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Georgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 (5.1.14.1 Prohibition) mentions the use of the negative particle ""nu"" with the Present Indicative or Future Indicative, and the alternative method of combining ""ar"" with the subjunctive mood. This indicates that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- Paragraph 3 (5.1.14.3 Unmarked) states that the neutral marker of negation is ""ar."" It also mentions that past statements which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive switch to the Perfect when negated by ""ar."" This shows that negation involves a modification of the verb form.

- Paragraph 4 (5.1.13.5 Surprise) provides examples of negation with ""ar"" and ""nu+tu,"" further indicating that negation can be marked by particles that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- Paragraph 5 (5.1.14.2 Potential) discusses the use of the special potential negative form ""ver"" with an indicative verb, showing another method of negation involving a bound morpheme.

These examples demonstrate that Georgian uses affixes, clitics, and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Alutor,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Alutor can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation and Circumfixes**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions the use of circumfixes for negation: ""circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in.""
   - Paragraph 5 provides examples of these circumfixes in use, such as ""tymNi-wisat-a"" (NEG-turn.sour-SUP) and ""a-viHy-kyl@in"" (A-die-NEG+3sg).

2. **Negative Particles with Verbal Affixes**:
   - Paragraph 1 discusses the combination of negative particles with verbal forms, indicating that the negative particle can be combined with the verb to form negative constructions, e.g., ""ally nota-la@u-ka"" (not A-see-PRED).

3. **Analytical Forms with Negative Prefixes**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the prefix ""nuN-"" in negative analytical forms: ""the analytical representation permits negative polarity, nuN- prefix marker being added.""

4. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 4 also discusses the analytical form derived from the negative analytical representation (nuN-...-a/-ta), indicating that the verb itself is modified to express negation.

Given these points, it is clear that Alutor employs affixes, circumfixes, and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Thai. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that for negative answers, the verb is preceded by the negative word ""MY"". For example, ""MY YOO"" means ""is not in"".

2. **Paragraph 5**: It states that ""MY DY"" placed in front of the verb means ""did not"". For example, ""CHUN MY DY PY"" means ""I did not go"".

3. **Paragraph 8**: It explains that a negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of the verb. For example, ""POM MY DY HEN ARY"" means ""I did not see anything at all"".

From these points, it is clear that the standard negation in Thai is achieved by placing the negative word ""MY"" (or ""MY DY"" for past tense) in front of the verb. This indicates that negation is marked by a separate word (particle) rather than an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself.

Therefore, based on the given paragraphs, standard negation in Thai cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning**: The provided paragraphs consistently show that negation in Thai is achieved by placing a separate negative word (particle) before the verb, rather than modifying the verb or using an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Nganasan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Nganasan can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in several instances where the negative auxiliary ""ńisɨ"" is used in conjunction with the connegative form of the main verb. For example, in Paragraph 4, it is stated that ""The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the connegative form of the main verb."" This indicates that the verb is modified to express negation. Additionally, the connegative marker ""-ʔ"" is attached to the verb, further supporting the use of affixes in marking negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs contain information about the morphological structure of the Nivkh language, particularly focusing on how negation is expressed. Here are the key points relevant to determining whether standard negation in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that affixes such as negation can occupy various positions in a verb form depending on their scope. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix.

2. **Paragraph 4** provides a table listing various negation forms, including:
   - `-ʁavr-` (NEG)
   - `-lәyә-` (NEG)
   - `-yzu-` (negative experiential/habitual)
   - `-molo-` (negative desiderative)
   - `-ger-` (negative disposition)
   - `-jiki-` (negative potential)
   - `-iruţez-` (fail, not manage)
   - `-ilәkr-` (negative purposive)

   These forms are clearly affixes or modifications of the verb, indicating that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

3. **Paragraph 10** describes the modal verb construction in Nivkh, stating that negative modality and negation itself can be expressed through verb root serialization. This involves the use of specific negative modals like `-ʁavr-`, `-ləyə-`, `-yzu-`, `-ger-`, `-molo-`, `-jiki-`, `-iruţez-`, and `-ilskr-`. These modals are integrated into the verb form, further supporting the idea that negation is marked by modifications of the verb.

4. **Paragraph 19** mentions that negation can be expressed by the supine form plus the intransitive `qauḑ` (""sth. does not exist"") or by verb root serialization with the transitive `lәyәḑ` (""s.o. lacks sth.""). This again indicates that negation involves modifications of the verb form.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jarawa (in Andamans),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jarawa can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix {-ma} is used to negate verbs, as seen in multiple examples:

- Paragraph 1: ""The suffix {-ma} can be used instead of naɖem."" Example (4.72) shows ""Noma-kajapečame-ma"" where {-ma} is attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 6: ""Another way to negate the sentence in Jarawa is to employ suffix {-ma} on the verbal predicate."" Example (4.67) shows ""allema-ma"" where {-ma} is attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 9: ""Morphological negation may also be used, i.e. the suffix {-ma}."" Example (4.80) shows ""ɖəbəᵼʈʰe-ma"" where {-ma} is attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 17: ""Similarly in the case of suffixes, one of the suffixes denoting evidential marker, modality marking or negative marking can attach to a verb."" This confirms the use of {-ma} as a negative suffix.

These examples demonstrate that the negative suffix {-ma} is phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation through an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nahali,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Nahali can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Clitics**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that negation can be marked by forms that precede or follow the verbal root. Specifically, ""ho:to"" is used to mark negation in non-past and past tenses and can occur preceding or following the verb (e.g., ""ho:to-kappo"" for 'does not/did not sleep').
   - Paragraph 4 further elaborates that ""beṭhe"" is used in non-past constructions and can either precede or follow the verb stem. When preceding the verb, it often undergoes assimilatory changes (e.g., ""jo beppa:ṭo"" for 'I will not come').

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 4 also indicates that the negative marker ""beṭhe"" can cause modifications to the verb when it precedes it, such as dropping the second syllable and geminating the first consonant of the verb (e.g., ""beṭhe > bep- / -p"").

3. **Examples of Negation**:
   - Multiple examples throughout the paragraphs show the use of ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:to"" as bound forms that attach to the verb to indicate negation (e.g., ""jo beṭhe ha:goken"" for 'I do not laugh', ""jo ho:to ha:go ḍa:n"" for 'I had not laughed').

4. **Negative Imperative Marker**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions ""biji"" as a negative imperative marker that can precede or follow the verb, sometimes undergoing assimilatory changes when it precedes the verb (e.g., ""ne biji ṭye"" for 'you don’t eat').

### Conclusion:
1

The evidence from the descriptive grammar clearly shows that standard negation in Nahali can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Kusunda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Kusunda can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that negative realis-assertion in Class II verbs is marked by a suffix -aÚu.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negative realis forms in Class II verbs, such as ""e-d-a u"" for ""I did not give"" and ""e-n-a u"" for ""you did not give.""
- Paragraph 4 discusses negative irrealis-assertion marked by a suffix -wa.
- Paragraph 5 explains that mutating verbs employ mutation as part of their marking strategy and add the negative suffix -u to the mutated root.
- Paragraph 7 shows examples of negative forms like ""t -aÚ -u"" for ""I did not go"" and ""n-˙m-daÚ u"" for ""You did not eat.""

These examples clearly indicate that negation in Kusunda is marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Udihe,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Udihe can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 4 (7.3. Negative conjugation) and Paragraph 9 (23.2. Negation) provide clear evidence of this. 

Paragraph 4 describes the negative conjugation in Udihe as being periphrastic, involving the negative auxiliary verb e(i)-, which precedes the content verb and takes various morphological forms. This indicates that the negative auxiliary verb is bound to the verb in a way that reflects the role of the predicate in the sentence. Additionally, the content verb appears as a bare stem or with derivational affixes, further supporting the idea that negation is marked by a modification of the verb.

Paragraph 9 reinforces this by stating that negation in Udihe is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-, which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms. Examples provided in this paragraph, such as ""e-si-ti etete-du"" (NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL) and ""e-s'e-li etete"" (NEG-PERF-CC.SS work), demonstrate that the negative auxiliary verb is phonologically bound to the verb, marking negation.

Therefore, it is clear that standard negation in Udihe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingush,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingush can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the negative morpheme is either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form: ""The negative morpheme is either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form: suffix for tense forms, proclitic cy for converbs and nonfinites, proclitic my for imperatives.""
  
- **Paragraph 5** reiterates that negation is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic elsewhere: ""Negation, not shown in (1), is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic elsewhere (§13.12).""

- **Paragraph 9** provides detailed examples of suffixal negation for finite verbs and proclitic negation for other forms: ""Indicative finite verbs are negated suffixally... For all other verb forms, negation is proclitic.""

- **Paragraph 15** confirms the use of negative proclitics cy and my with nonfinite forms and imperatives: ""Negation is suffixed in finite tenses... but with other verb forms it is a proclitic particle. There are two negative proclitics: neutral cy and prohibitive my.""

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Ingush involves modifications directly on the verb, either through suffixes or proclitics, which are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Lezgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Lezgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically:

- Paragraph 2 mentions that finite indicative verb forms are negated by the suffix -δ (e.g., guzwa 'gives', guzwa-δ 'does not give'). This indicates that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 3 reiterates that verbs are negated by the negative suffix -δ or by the negative prefix tA-. This further supports the presence of affixal negation.
- Paragraph 4 provides examples of verbs with the negative suffix -δ in use, such as ""awa-δ"" (be-NEG) and ""awa-δ-ir"" (be-NEG-PST), confirming the use of suffixes for negation.

These examples clearly show that standard negation in Lezgian involves modifications of the verb through affixes.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Galo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Galo can be marked by an affix. Specifically, the negation suffix -máa is used to mark negative polarity in final predicates. This is clearly illustrated in Paragraph 1, where it is stated that ""Final predicates in negative polarity are obligatorily suffixed in -máa."" Additionally, examples such as (614) and (615) demonstrate the use of -máa as a suffix attached to the verb to indicate negation. This suffixed form is consistent with the criteria for an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the suppletive negative participle ""-nguq"" in the verb ""tekite-ksail-nguq=wa"" (arrive-NEG-PTP.3sg.=REA) and ""tekite-ksait-uq"" (arrive-NEG-IND.3sg.), indicating that negation is marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of negation with the suffix ""-nrit-"" in ""ane-llru-nrit-ua"" (go.out-PST-NEG-IND.1sg.), showing that negation is marked by a modification of the verb.
- Paragraph 4 lists various negative suffixes such as ""|-nћլit-|"" (not), ""|-ksait-|"" (not yet), and others, indicating that negation is marked by affixes attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 7 contrasts negative appositional forms like ""|ayaћ+pѠkѠ[-nani|"" (leave-NEG-APP.3Rsg.) with indicative forms like ""|ayaћ-nћլit[+1tuq|"" (leave-NEG-IND.3sg.), further confirming that negation is marked by modifications of the verb.
- Paragraph 8 discusses the use of negative appositional mood markers like ""|-1na-|"" after negative suffixes, reinforcing that negation involves affixes attached to the verb.

These examples consistently show that negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) is marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuki,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar, it is clear that standard negation in Yuki can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative morpheme -ṭan is used as a suffix to negate verbs in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. This is evident from multiple examples and explanations provided in the paragraphs.

For instance, Paragraph 1 explicitly states, ""The primary method for negation in Yuki is the negation of the verb by the suffixation of a negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb."" This is further supported by examples such as:
- (60) ""ˀal miˀ lu:htlanpaˀ"" (wood 2SG.AGT chop-TR-NEG-FUT) meaning ""You’re not going to chop wood.""
- (62) ""haw mila ˀap li:ˀaktanpaˀ"" (tomorrow meat/deer=PAT 1SG.AGT kill-SEM-NEG-FUT) meaning ""I’m not going to kill that deer tomorrow.""

Additionally, Paragraph 4 provides further examples of negated verbs using the -ṭan suffix:
- (103) ""mu:šakṭanpaˀ"" (laugh-SEM-NEG-FUT) meaning ""He’s not gonna laugh.""
- (104) ""ki ˀi hąw č a:niṭan"" (DST 1SG.PAT fish give-NEG) meaning ""He won’t give that fish to me.""

These examples clearly demonstrate that the negation in Yuki is achieved by suffixing the negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb, thus confirming that standard negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Pipil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Pipil can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 provides clear examples of negation involving the use of ""te:"" and ""tesu"" as negative markers that are directly associated with the verb forms. For instance, in the sentence ""tesu ni-k-neki ma: xi-k-mikti,"" the negation ""tesu"" is used in conjunction with the verb ""ni-k-neki."" Additionally, the examples in Paragraph 5 show that negation can be marked by particles that are closely tied to the verb, indicating that negation is integrated into the verb phrase.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Micmac can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides crucial information about the negative forms of intransitive verbs. It mentions that the negative morpheme seems to be ""-w-"" and that it appears to follow the dual or plural number morpheme but precedes the person markers. This indicates that the negative morpheme is an affix that attaches to the verb, as it is placed within the verb structure itself (stem + number morpheme + negative morpheme + person marker).

2. **Paragraph 4** further supports this by discussing the rule that must precede the insertion of the negative morpheme in the forms of animate verbs, indicating that the negative morpheme is integrated into the verb morphology.

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the endings of verbs in the negative forms are identical to the simple negative endings, which implies that the negative morpheme is part of the verb's morphological structure.

4. **Paragraph 10** discusses the derivation of negative forms and suggests that the negative morpheme is part of the verb's inflectional morphology.

These paragraphs collectively provide sufficient evidence that standard negation in Micmac involves an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) is marked by the negative particle ""jaantu"" or its truncated form ""tuu,"" which precedes the verb or the verb phrase. There is no evidence in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negative particle ""jaantu"" is used independently and is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraph 1: Describes the use of the negative particle ""jaantu"" and its truncated form ""tuu"" which precedes the verb or verb phrase. There is no mention of affixes or clitics attached to the verb for negation.
- Paragraph 2: Provides examples where ""jaantu"" precedes the verb or adverb, indicating its role as a separate particle rather than an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 3: Further examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and verb phrases, reinforcing its role as an independent particle.
- Paragraph 4: Discusses the clitic +ka7 attaching to ""jaantu"" or ""tuu"" but not to the verb, indicating that negation is not marked directly on the verb.
- Paragraph 5: Mentions the use of ""jaantu"" in forming negative questions and tag questions, again showing it as an independent particle.
- Paragraph 6: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs in various contexts, with no indication of it being an affix or clitic.
- Paragraph 7: Describes the use of ""jaantu"" in negative future constructions, where it precedes the verb.
- Paragraph 8: Discusses the realis mood and negation, with ""jaantu"" preceding the verb.
- Paragraph 9: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs in negative indicative sentences.
- Paragraph 10: Mentions the clitic +ka7 attaching to ""jaantu"" or ""tuu,"" not to the verb.
- Paragraph 11: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs in various moods.
- Paragraph 12: Discusses the use of ""jaantu"" in negative tag questions.
- Paragraph 13: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and adjectives.
- Paragraph 14: Discusses the realis mood and negation, with ""jaantu"" preceding the verb.
- Paragraph 15: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and adjectives.
- Paragraph 16: Example of ""jaantu"" used as a negative tag.
- Paragraph 17: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs in future tense constructions.
- Paragraph 18: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and adjectives.
- Paragraph 19: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and adjectives.
- Paragraph 20: Examples of ""jaantu"" preceding verbs and adjectives.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information to determine if standard negation in Musqueam can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Paragraph 7:**
This paragraph mentions specific forms related to negation:
- ""4.6. Negative past habitual, 'never' (?ewe-2-4.4, ?ew-E2-4,4, ?eaw-e-4,4-2)""
- ""4.7, ?ew-€-2-4,.4 (negative past interrogative)""

The forms provided here suggest that negation in Musqueam involves prefixes or affixes attached to the verb. The use of ""negative past habitual"" and ""negative past interrogative"" with specific morphemes (?ewe-, ?ew-, ?eaw-) indicates that these are bound morphemes that modify the verb to convey negation.

**Paragraph 10:**
This paragraph provides examples of negative sentences:
- ""'He never‘Didn't as in ?ew&ex”1émex”?owfex” ¢*flemex”‘Willyousing?,heonlyever example is negative ‘willyou(Won'tgo?! you""

The use of ?ew- in the examples further supports the presence of a negative prefix that attaches to the verb.

**Paragraph 20:**
This paragraph discusses the formation of negative verbs:
- ""Whena passiveor sk*”éy theendwith-Tk?“osofthetold'wasn'ttold’‘youfolksweren'tis thefirstverb(‘impossible’ passivewithtold'-1ortold' after'can't')objectpronoun,with-sTa negativeadd £>3t}toThus:-0213m-3t-1213m-3t-s0213m-3t~eam-3t-1aem-3t-seam-3t‘you(one person)!-tdm-3t-13m-3¢-stdm-3t""the,she,-taldm-3t= -st&1ldm-3t= ""youfolks!(-4ix""es -3tisn't a true passive is not added)‘Ttsoit,they'‘wetExamples:sk>“éy kosméyetl3m3tsk?”éyk’“osméyeamdt‘you'I can't be helped!sk’""éykosméytdm3t‘'he/she/it/theysk’""éyk°¥osméytaldm3tcan't'youbefolkshelped! can'tcan'tbe helped’be helped!""

This paragraph shows the use of negative morphemes in the verb forms, indicating that negation can be marked by affixes.

**Reasoning:**
The evidence from the paragraphs indicates that negation in Musqueam can be marked by prefixes or affixes attached to the verb. The specific negative morphemes (?ewe-, ?ew-, ?eaw-) and their attachment to verbs in various examples demonstrate that negation is indeed marked by modifications of the verb through bound morphemes.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Omaha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that to negate a verb, a negating particle is added after it, and this particle is conjugated. This suggests that the negating particle is closely tied to the verb, potentially functioning as a clitic.

2. **Paragraph 5** describes how a preceding -e verb ablauts to -a before the negating particle azhi, indicating a modification of the verb in the presence of negation.

3. **Paragraph 10** states that when azhi is used, it combines tightly with the preceding verb, suggesting that it functions as a clitic.

4. **Paragraph 17** provides an example where the verb ""thá"" (to go) is negated by adding azhi, resulting in ""thá azhi a/ga!"" for ""Don't go!"". This further supports the idea that azhi is a clitic or affix that attaches to the verb.

These pieces of evidence collectively indicate that standard negation in Omaha can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Washo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the presence of a ""Negative;stem—initial"" morpheme. This indicates that there is a negative marker that attaches to the verb stem, which suggests that negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Paragraph 4** includes the term ""-é°s Negative,"" which implies that there is a negative suffix used in the language. This further supports the idea that negation can be marked by an affix.

Given these pieces of evidence, it is clear that negation in Washo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Koasati,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Koasati can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 3**: The example ""afén-h4kko-ma:mi-Vhco-Y"" (KNOW-3neg(2A)-phr-term) indicates the use of a negative suffix ""-h4kko-"" attached to the verb to mark negation.
- **Paragraph 4**: The mention of ""negative subject cross-reference suffixes"" and the comparison of negative markers across different verb classes imply that negation is marked by affixes attached to the verb.
- **Paragraph 6**: The examples ""bankokAnko"" (He does not want it) and ""kamnotikkg"" (He does not need it) show the use of negative markers that are part of the verb morphology.
- **Paragraph 7**: The phrase ""WANT-3neg(2A)-phrterm"" and the example ""ca-ban-ko-Y"" (I do not want to shave) further illustrate the use of negative affixes attached to verbs.
- **Paragraph 12**: The example ""ca-téin-k-A:pi-t"" (I almost didn’t fall) shows the use of a negative suffix ""-k-"" in the verb form.
- **Paragraph 16**: The example ""im-ayba;ci-thicikko-Vhoo-toho-k"" (We do not help him) demonstrates the use of a negative marker ""-thicikko-"" attached to the verb.

These examples collectively indicate that Koasati employs affixes or modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Chumash (Barbareño),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Chumash (Barbareño) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative prefix ""e-"" is used to mark negation on verbs. This is seen in multiple examples where the prefix ""e-"" is attached to verbs to convey negation.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, it is mentioned that ""12 or 23% have the negative prefix e-,"" and in Paragraph 6, examples such as ""tSupe?aSni-pi>~""thiskla-wa""~3Shilwoté-ya*>.éu__=p-e-aSnipit"" (so that you do not step on a broken bottle) demonstrate the use of the negative prefix ""e-"" attached to verbs. Additionally, Paragraph 12 explicitly states, ""Negation in Barbareno Chumash always appears in the form of the prefix -e-.""

These examples clearly show that negation is marked by a prefix that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that the sentential negative phrase is a pre-clitic on the verb phrase. This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
   
2. **Paragraph 5** further supports this by stating that when Yes/No questions are negative, the question post-clitic is almost always attached to the negative pre-clitic. This shows that the negative pre-clitic is indeed a part of the verb phrase.

3. **Paragraph 12** provides additional evidence by stating that the negative pre-clitic ""ni-"" can be attached to the verb, giving it scope over the verb and therefore the sentence. This confirms that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 13** includes examples where the negative pre-clitic ""ne-"" is attached to the verb, such as in ""ne-s'e-gwa"" (NEG-say) and ""ne-dzo"" (NEG-bring), further demonstrating that negation is marked by a clitic bound to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the information to determine if standard negation in Alsea can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Paragraph 1:
> _~It serves asa particle of negation and 1s be""t renc10J'ed cy NO, 1\0'£.

This paragraph suggests the presence of a negation particle but does not provide clear information on whether it attaches to the verb or stands alone.

Paragraph 2:
> •Sinee this mood te treated as a future expression.the pronouns reprosentlng the persons addressed to, are prefixed to the negative partlcle t;hat ntust precede the verb (see§§36. 80, 144),
Dual and plural objects arc indicatec. by means of the pronominal
·ele:;nents for the dual and plural third person (see ~ 35).

This paragraph indicates that the negative particle precedes the verb, but it does not clarify if the particle is phonologically bound to the verb or if it is a separate word.

Paragraph 4:
> Hence. it is pl""eceded by such fOI""mative elements, as:,the neut:!;'al957),_usx (see 9 52). the re1'leXiV'&the continuative-~.-..:!! (see_~ (sos § 19) and others •.Lt is inno way related to the prohibitive suffix for transitive verbs

This paragraph mentions the absence of a particle of negation in a specific context but does not provide information on how negation is generally marked.

Paragraph 7:
> •adjectivethat, indeed., it fitted him 56.12Laa1mxayuts •• ,ts_y~dT tsxa-;:;isk'iLIya(yai1tsxatconsists of two distinct elements(see§§26,second e.<.ement is tho prcticle of negation

This paragraph mentions that certain suffixes can be added to verbs or nouns, but it does not specify if this applies to negation.

Given the information in the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to definitively determine if standard negation in Alsea can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs suggest the use of a negation particle, but they do not provide clear evidence of it being phonologically bound to the verb or modifying the verb directly.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Arikara.

Paragraph 1:
- Mentions the substitution of ""kaaka/kaski"" in the negative form, but it is unclear if this is an affix, clitic, or separate word.

Paragraph 2:
- States that the indicative prefix is a separate word and the negative prefix that replaces it is also a separate word. This suggests that negation is marked by a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.

Paragraph 9:
- Provides examples of negative patterns in Arikara, such as ""kaakAtwaaWlhtiiku’"" for ""I’m not talking."" The prefix ""kaakA-"" appears consistently in negative forms, suggesting it is an affix attached to the verb.

Paragraph 6:
- Discusses grammatical additions to the verb, including affixes that indicate various grammatical categories. This implies that affixes are used in the language, potentially including for negation.

From the information given, particularly Paragraph 9, it is evident that the prefix ""kaakA-"" is used as an affix to mark negation in verbs. This prefix is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that standard negation in Arikara can indeed be marked by an affix.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraph 9 provides clear examples of verbs in their negative forms with the prefix ""kaakA-,"" indicating that negation is marked by an affix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 6 supports the use of affixes in the language for various grammatical functions, including potentially negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Takelma can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the particle ""wede"" used with the inferential and potential to form the negative future and imperative. The example ""wede d6“ma’/'n I SHOULD NOT HAVE KILLED HIM, I WOULD NOT KILL HIM"" shows that ""wede"" is used to negate verbs in these contexts.

2. **Paragraph 12** provides further evidence of ""wede"" being used as a negative adverb prefixed to verbs to negate future and imperative forms. Examples include:
   - ""wede yana‘k‘ he will not go""
   - ""wede yana’k!ett' you will not go""
   - ""wede yana’k‘a‘ I shall not go""
   - ""wede dimzbiga‘ I shall not kill you""

These examples clearly show that ""wede"" is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation in Takelma can be marked by a clitic or affix attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Jemez,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions a negative prefix /W&/ that can be attached to verbs. This indicates that negation can be marked by a prefix, which is a type of affix.
   
2. **Paragraph 10** provides an example of a negative prefix intervening between parts of a pronominal prefix: ""He did not wake up"" is glossed as (neg iben[3sg]-neg-reWpl-wake.up/pf), showing the use of a negative prefix.

3. **Paragraph 16** discusses the incorporative form used in negative imperative constructions, indicating that verbs can take a specific form to express negation.

These pieces of evidence collectively demonstrate that negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Zuni can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: The examples given show the use of a negative suffix ""-nam"" attached to the verb. For instance, ""waccitayaktoh-nam-kya"" (hit-neg.-past) indicates that the verb ""hit"" is negated by the suffix ""-nam"".

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph also provides examples of verbs with negative suffixes. For instance, ""‘itok'ya-nam-kya"" (feed-neg.-past) and ""‘itok'ya-na:w-amme-kya"" (feed-pl.subj.-neg.(stat.)-past) show the use of ""-nam"" and ""-na:w-amme"" as negative markers attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 5**: It explicitly states that ""Two elements are required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, a negative particle and a negative verb stem suffix"". This confirms the presence of a negative suffix on the verb.

4. **Paragraph 6**: The example ""jaka’tompalo-k-na'ma"" (neg.2sg.acc.buried-K-neg.) shows the use of ""-k"" and ""-nam"" as negative markers attached to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 14**: The example ""ka’tom‘itok'ya-na-k-na'm-a"" (neg.2sg.acc.feed-passive-K-neg.-pres.) further illustrates the use of negative suffixes ""-na"" and ""-nam"" on the verb.

6. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides clear examples of verbs with negative suffixes. For instance, ""‘okyaccik'te'le’k'oSo-nam-kya"" (wash-neg.-past) shows the verb ""wash"" negated by the suffix ""-nam"".

Given these examples and explanations, it is evident that standard negation in Zuni can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Rama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative morphemes ""taama"" and ""yaana"" which can be used to negate clauses.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negation involving the particle ""aa"" which is used preverbally and is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in the example ""aa y-aalu-iikr-i"" (NEG 3-send-want-TNS) meaning ""she doesn't want to send her child to school.""
3. **Paragraph 4** states that the negation particle ""aa"" is prefixed to the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.
4. **Paragraph 7** shows examples of the negation markers ""aa"" and ""taama/tahma"" being used with verbs, such as ""alkwis-taama"" (talk-NEG) meaning ""I don't talk.""
5. **Paragraph 9** discusses the placement of the negation word ""aa"" as the left boundary of the verb form in Rama, indicating that it is an integral part of the verb form.

These examples clearly demonstrate that standard negation in Rama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tonkawa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Tonkawa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 discusses the negative suffix ""-abe-"" which is added directly to the verb theme to form the negative of any verb. This suffix is inserted between the theme and other suffixes, such as the future tense suffix, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb. Examples provided in the paragraph include ""yagb-ab-o'c"" (I do not hit him) and ""geigab-ab-o'"" (he does not hit me), demonstrating the use of the negative suffix ""-abe-"" attached to the verb theme.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Tunica,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tunica can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple examples of negative postfixes such as -aha, -k?aha, and -?aha being attached to verbs to form negative constructions. For instance:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative postfix -?aha being added to positive forms to create negative forms.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples of the negative postfix -?aha and -k?aha being used with verbs.
- Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 5 give specific examples of verbs with negative postfixes, such as ""?uya’ Sitehé"" (He did not get angry) and ""haka'liwik?aha'ni"" (He would not stop, it is said).
- Paragraph 16 explicitly states that the negative paradigms of active verbs are formed by means of the negative postfixes -aha and -k?aha.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Tunica involves the use of affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Wappo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Wappo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

Paragraph 4 (§107. The Negative) is particularly relevant. It describes the formation of negation using the postposition ""la'ki,"" which is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix ""-ki."" The paragraph notes that ""la'ki"" affects the preceding verb-stem similarly to subordinating suffixes like ""-tsel"" and ""-kwen,"" often causing them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This indicates that the negation marker ""la'ki"" is phonologically bound to the verb, affecting its form.

Additionally, the paragraph mentions that ""la"" has been specialized into a suffix or postposition with the meaning ""without,"" further supporting the idea that negation in Wappo involves affixation or modification of the verb.

Therefore, the evidence suggests that standard negation in Wappo can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ute,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ute can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides multiple examples of negative morphemes that are affixed to verbs. For instance, the negative participle ""-ait-ϊ-"" and the negative verbalizing ""-ai-"" are mentioned. The forms ""-a-"", ""-a'-"", and ""-a-'q-u-"" are used to indicate negation directly on the verb. Additionally, the suffix ""-n a'ai-"" is used as a negative suffix for certain verbs, and the participialized form ""-n a'ait i-"" is also mentioned.

- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that verbs can be provided with a negative suffix or negative modification of a verbalizing suffix. Examples include the use of ""-apa-"" for absolute negatives and ""-ywa'ai-"" for non-absolute negatives. The future negative suffix ""-ywa'ai-"" is also mentioned, indicating that negation is marked on the verb.

- **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions the use of suffixes indicating plurality and other grammatical features, which supports the idea that suffixes, including negative ones, can be attached to verbs.

The consistent mention of negative suffixes and modifications directly on the verbs across these paragraphs clearly indicates that standard negation in Ute can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Yurok. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that Yurok negative sentences are usually formed with the preverb ""neemee"" or the emphatic negative particle ""mos"". It specifies that ""neemee"" is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs.

2. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of sentences using ""neemee"" as a preverb:
   - (123a) ""Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’."" (""I don’t feel well."")
   - (123b) ""Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet."" (""It’s not very windy here."")
   - (123c) ""Kue pa’aahl ’we-tmenomen neemee nepue’."" (""The half of the salmon facing the water was not eaten."")
   - (123d) ""Muehlcho’ neemee soo komchuemehl."" (""Perhaps they do not know."")
   - (123e) ""Neemee hegohkuemehl stowstek’ ’ue-’weskwen neemee mehl hego’omah."" (""They did not pick fir branches and did not make fire with them."")

3. **Paragraph 10** discusses the use of ""neemee"" with the resultative preverb ""keech"", indicating that negation can appear before or after ""keech"":
   - (131a) ""Mos keech ’ee roo kee ’ue-kemeyeem’."" (""It is not time to go home yet."")
   - (131b) ""Mos keech hopkekom’."" (""He has not started yet."")
   - (131c) ""Neemee keech lekon’."" (""It has not fallen yet."")

4. **Paragraph 14** mentions that for future negation, ""neemee"" is used with the modal future preverb ""kee"":
   - (128a) ""Neemee kee kooych."" (""I will not buy it."")
   - (128b) ""Neemee kee skuy’ soo hoole’mow’."" (""You will not get on well."")

5. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of ""neemee"" used with the past-time preverb ""wo"":
   - (126a) ""Kwesee’ neemee nuemee wo chpaa nohl helomey’."" (""Coyote did not dance for a very long time."")
   - (126b) ""Neemee wo hlee’."" (""It was not accepted."")
   - (126c) ""Neemee wo weykee’."" (""It was not finished."")
   - (126d) ""Neemee heenoy wo hoole’moh."" (""We did not follow you."")
   - (126e) ""Neemee wo nahchelek’ kee ’ne-hlkyorkwek’."" (""I wasn’t allowed to watch."")
   - (126f) ""Neemee wo skeweenepek’."" (""I didn’t eat enough."")

From these examples, it is clear that ""neemee"" functions as a preverb that attaches to the verb, indicating that standard negation in Yurok can be marked by a preverb, which is a type of affix. This preverb is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking through an affix or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The preverb ""neemee"" is consistently used before the verb to indicate negation.
- This preverb is phonologically bound to the verb, as it directly precedes it and forms a single phonological unit with the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Nuuchahnulth,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, it is evident that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 4 provides examples of negation using the root ""vhj"" (not) combined with various clitics and affixes to form negative constructions. For instance, in example (248)d, ""vhJ`QpTr"" (vhj<""`Q<pt9<r) translates to ""not=TEMP=COND=1sg,"" indicating that negation is marked by a combination of the negation root ""vhj"" and the clitics attached to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 4.6.2.1 further supports this by showing the use of ""vhj"" in negative constructions with clitics.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the given paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that clauses contain both the negation particle ""Jut"" and a predicate marked for irrealis mode.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that the negation particle ""Jut"" appears at the beginning of the clause followed by a nominalized predicate.
3. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that clauses contain the negation particle ""Jut"" followed by a nominalized predicate.
4. **Paragraph 10** describes Pattern A, which consists of a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause.
5. **Paragraph 18** points out that negation can trigger nominalization of the negated predicate.

From these points, it is clear that the standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi involves the use of a negation particle ""Jut"" followed by a nominalized predicate. The nominalization of the predicate is a modification that occurs due to negation. This modification of the verb (nominalization) is a key aspect of how negation is marked in the language.

Therefore, standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb (nominalization).

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Hidatsa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Hidatsa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative suffix ""-dhaa"" attached to the verb, as seen in examples like ""Macéédhaac"" (He is not a man) and ""úˀsiadhaac"" (he hasn’t arrived). Additionally, Paragraph 6 provides further evidence with the example ""Gíìxidha!"" (Don’t whine!), where the negative suffix ""-dhaa"" is used in prohibitive commands. These examples clearly indicate that negation in Hidatsa involves a suffix that attaches directly to the verb, thereby modifying it to express negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Toqabaqita,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Toqabaqita can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative verb ""aqi"" is used in various constructions, often combined with subject markers to form a phonologically bound unit. For example, in Paragraph 5, the construction ""qe=aqi"" (3SG.NFUT=NEGV) is used to express negation. This indicates that the negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 10 discusses the double negative construction, where ""aqi"" is used in combination with subject markers to form a negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Aghu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Aghu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 4 mentions negated finite future forms with the structure ""ade-Ø=dè xo"" where ""de"" is a clitic marking negation.
- Paragraph 5 provides examples like ""nuatosunuaküme=kuòxo"" and ""amsexobüsiüaxi-nàŋ=guòxo,"" where ""=kuòxo"" and ""=guòxo"" are clitics marking negation.
- Paragraph 6 shows examples such as ""joxodebaxe-n=dexo"" and ""nügutedafi-n=dexo,"" where ""=dexo"" is a clitic marking negation.
- Paragraph 9 discusses the form ""da-de=dèxo"" where ""=dèxo"" is a clitic marking negation.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Aghu is achieved through clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Manambu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Manambu can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 1 mentions that in non-future tense negative clauses, the verb often takes a special negative form, which can involve vowel changes. For example, ""gra- ‘cry’"" becomes ""ma: ga:r ‘does not/did not cry’"", indicating a modification of the verb root to express negation.

2. **Affix/Clitic Bound to the Verb**: Paragraph 8 discusses the use of the dependent negation marker ""-ma:r-"" which attaches to the verb stem in dependent clauses, questions, and focus structures. For instance, ""kur- ‘do/get’"" becomes ""kwa:r-ma:r- ‘do/get.neg’"".

3. **Examples of Bound Negators**: Paragraph 1 also shows that in future tense negative clauses, the negator ""ma:"" is postposed to the verb root, as in ""gra ma: ‘will not cry’"", indicating that the negator is phonologically bound to the verb.

These points collectively demonstrate that negation in Manambu involves modifications to the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Momu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Momu can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative particle ""momu"" is used as a sentential negator and can attach to the verb as shown in the examples:

- (12.43) (a) Ie eru netyi=momu.
  fish that throw.one[1|3sgS]=neg
  ‘He did not throw the fish.’

- (12.43) (b) Bikos kwu eru, ai-kuw=momu esy=e.
  because food that impf-consume\3sgS=neg sago.jelly=emph
  ‘Because he does/did not eat that food, the sago jelly.’

These examples demonstrate that ""momu"" functions as a clitic that attaches to the verb to indicate negation. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Makasae:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of the negator ""nomo"" and provides examples of its usage. It indicates that ""nomo"" is a free particle and not phonetically dependent on other words, suggesting it is not an affix or clitic.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Confirms that ""nomo"" is a free particle and not phonetically bound to other words.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions a negative prefix ""ni-"" which negates the meaning of the verb it is used with. This indicates that negation can be marked by a prefix, which is an affix.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses the placement of ""nomo"" within the VP and its interaction with other markers, reinforcing that ""nomo"" is a free particle.

5. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions that negative verbs are not compatible with the internal negator ""nomo"" but can be negated with the clausal negator ""nomohaka"". This suggests that ""nomohaka"" is also a free particle.

6. **Paragraph 12**: Provides examples of the negative prefix ""ni-"", confirming its usage as a verbal prefix.

From the information provided, it is clear that Makasae uses the negative prefix ""ni-"" as a method of standard negation, which is an affix. Therefore, standard negation in Makasae can be marked by an affix.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Motuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Motuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several instances:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the Negative Optative forms, which include suffixes like -taa and -raa, indicating that negation can be marked by affixes attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples where the negator ""toku"" is used in combination with verbs, such as ""tokunoingo-i-heeta-na"" (you will not do any big work) and ""tokurunnimeekusingngoota-wa-mo"" (they were not believing it very much). This suggests that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb or by a clitic/affix.
- Paragraph 8 discusses the negative infix /-woo-/ used in various verb forms, such as ""mon-i-woo-ku"" (negative infix + General Different Subject) and ""mon-u-woo-juu"" (negative infix + Continuous Different Subject), further supporting the presence of verb modification for negation.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Motuna involves affixes or modifications directly applied to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Lavukaleve,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Lavukaleve can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the verbal suffix -la is used to negate verbs, as mentioned in multiple instances throughout the text. For example:

- Paragraph 1: ""Verbs can be negated using the verbal suffix -la...""
- Paragraph 1: ""The verbal suffix -la (glossed NEG) is used to negate a verb...""
- Paragraph 2: ""The negative suffix cannot co-occur with any TAM suffixes...""
- Paragraph 2: ""The lexical verb carries the Negative suffix...""
- Paragraph 3: ""The particle tamu negates an entire clause or an NP...""
- Paragraph 4: ""The Admonitive verbal suffix -n can be used to give a negative command...""
- Paragraph 5: ""The negative imperative use of the suffix commands the hearer not to carry out the action of the verb...""

Dla (Menggwa),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation for Negation**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that negative irrealis verbs differ from positive irrealis verbs by having an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem. The negative realis affix forms include ma-, -ma, -me, or -m.
   - **Paragraph 2**: It states that negative irrealis is conveyed by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.
   - **Paragraph 4**: Examples such as ""kliklibokahwa"" (scratch-NEG:R-N1SG-3FSG:O-PAST) and ""iŋgufu boka-hi-Ø-hwa"" (attack-NEG:R-1SG-3MSG:O-PAST) show that negation is marked by the affix -boka.
   - **Paragraph 5**: It provides examples of innovative negative realis forms where the negative irrealis affix (ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m) is used to indicate negative realis, e.g., ""ma-ser-iha-hwa"" (NEG:R-eat-1SG-PAST).
   - **Paragraph 6**: It mentions irregular negative irrealis affixes, such as an infix [ma] in ""si[ma]ha-"" (remove cooked food from fire).
   - **Paragraph 11**: It describes the use of negative irrealis affixes (ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m) in non-future tentative mood verb forms.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - **Paragraph 12**: It explains that negative realis verbs are formed by the lexical verb in its non-finite form followed by a negative realis verb boke or boka, which are separate phonological words but still involve modification of the verb form.

3. **Clitic Usage**:
   - **Paragraph 16**: It describes the negative semi-realis particle ga, which is a separate phonological word and does not count as an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

Given the evidence from the paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can indeed be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Duna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, it is evident that standard negation in Duna can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to express negation on verbal predicates. This circumfix is added to the base form of the verb, as shown in multiple examples:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" and provides examples such as ""na-ra-ya"" (NEG-be/sit-NEG) and ""na-hoa-ya"" (NEG-come-NEG).
- Paragraph 2 further elaborates on the use of the negative circumfix in combination with TAM inflections, indicating that the circumfix forms a negative stem that takes the same inflections as a regular verb.
- Paragraph 3 provides additional examples of the negative circumfix in use, such as ""na-ri-ya-na"" (NEG-say-NEG-HAB).
- Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 14 also show the application of the negative circumfix in different contexts, reinforcing its role in marking negation on verbs.

These examples clearly demonstrate that the standard negation in Duna involves a modification of the verb through the use of a negative circumfix.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Taulil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taulil, it is clear that standard negation in Taulil can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negator ""kori"" is used before the verb complex to negate verbal clauses, as seen in examples like:

- (177) a. ""lok=pənik o kori tə-t∼təm =a pern =a ləmat."" (Young men, they didn’t know (how to) climb for coconut.)
- (177) b. ""bə= kori də-p∼pi tə=be Rabaul."" (We are not going to Rabaul.)

Additionally, the negator ""kori"" can be used with the non-specific pronoun ""go"" to negate non-verbal clauses, but for verbal clauses, ""kori"" alone is sufficient and is placed immediately before the verb complex.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Taiap,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Taiap can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation involves the use of the irrealis suffixes -ki, -kɨ, or -ku attached to the verb stem, followed by the negator wákare. This is seen in multiple examples across the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1: ""The negated form of all these verbs is: (5-5) okɨ wákare o-kɨ wákare go.irr -irr neg""
- Paragraph 2: ""a-kru wákare consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o neg""
- Paragraph 4: ""Modality is marked by one of the three irrealis suffixes -kɨ, -ki or -ku (see Section 5.2.2).""
- Paragraph 10: ""negative intransitive future o-kɨ wákare go.irr-irr neg""

These examples show that the verb stem is modified by the irrealis suffixes, and the negator wákare is used to indicate negation. The irrealis suffixes are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yimas,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yimas can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in multiple instances where the negative prefix ""ta-"" is used to negate verbs, and this prefix is phonologically bound to the verb. Additionally, there are suffixes that indicate negation, such as the negative number suffixes (e.g., -rm, -ump) that attach to the verb. Here are some key points from the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that ""the negative verb is affixed with a particular suffix which references the number of the S argument,"" and provides examples like ""ta-pu-wa-na-rm"" (NEG-3-go-NR PAST-DL) meaning ""Those two didn't go yesterday.""
- Paragraph 2 provides examples of negative verbs with suffixes, such as ""ta-nan-i-c-IJkan-mpan-mpwi"" (NEG-2PL A-tell-PERF-PC-3PL D-talk) meaning ""You few didn't tell them.""
- Paragraph 3 shows the use of the negative prefix ""ta-"" in examples like ""ta-mpu-IJa-tkam-r-IJ"" (NEG-3PL A-1SG D-show-PERF-VI SG) meaning ""They didn't show me it (the coconut).""
- Paragraph 5 further illustrates the use of the negative prefix ""ta-"" in examples like ""ta-pu-wa-t-0"" (NEG-3-go-PERF-SG) meaning ""He didn't go.""
- Paragraph 6 also supports this with examples like ""ta-ka-wa-t"" (NEG-1SG S-go-PERF) meaning ""I didn't go.""

These examples consistently show that negation is marked by the prefix ""ta-"" and sometimes by suffixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that standard negation in Yimas can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine if standard negation in the language Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provided do not contain explicit information about the negation strategies used in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. They primarily discuss various aspects of verb morphology, case marking, and other grammatical features, but none directly address the method of standard negation.

**Reasoning:**
1. Paragraphs discuss verb morphology, inflectional prefixes, and other grammatical categories but do not provide information on how negation is marked.
2. There is no mention of negation particles, affixes, or clitics specifically related to negation in the provided text.
3. The examples provided do not illustrate negative constructions.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Maybrat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Maybrat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions the use of the clausal negator ""fe"" and its predicative counterpart ""m-fe"". Examples such as ""m-fe"" (3U-NEG) clearly show that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb. For instance, in (166) ""arko m-fe"" translates to ""There is no firewood,"" indicating that ""m-fe"" is a verb modification used for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph further supports the use of ""m-fe"" as a negator, showing that it can negate an NP and is used in sentences like ""arko m-fe"" (firewood 3U-NEG) meaning ""There is no firewood.""

- **Paragraph 6**: It reiterates that ""m-fe"" is used predicatively and must be used in place of ""y-fe"" (3M-NEG), which is unacceptable. This indicates that negation involves a specific modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 7**: It discusses the use of ""m-fe"" in alternative questions, such as in (14) ""n-amo sekolah fe m-fe a"" (2-go school NEG 3U-NEG INT) meaning ""Will you go to school or not?"" Here, ""m-fe"" is used to negate the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that Maybrat uses verb modifications (specifically the affix ""m-fe"") to mark standard negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Asmat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Asmat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention several forms of negation that are directly linked to the verb. For instance:

- Paragraph 3 mentions the negations ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" which are linked to specific forms of the verb (e.g., ""m-/mV- forms of the verb: m@or pdk embf"" meaning ""see not /did I did not see it"").
- Paragraph 4 discusses the negation ""pok"" which is found after the ""m-/mV- form of the verb"" (e.g., ""j6mupupok"" meaning ""sun /come up / let not"").
- Paragraph 6 mentions that the forms with the prefix ""m-/mV-"" are used in negation (e.g., ""mi-tew6r"" meaning ""to take"").
- Paragraph 14 and 18 further elaborate on the use of prefixes like ""tep-/tepa-"" and ""m-/mV-"" in forming negative interrogative and explicative forms respectively.

These examples show that negation in Asmat involves modifications of the verb or the use of affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Kuot,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Kuot can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention the use of the negator ""tǝle"" which can attach to verbs and other constituents, and the presence of clitics such as ""=kan"" which attach to the negator. Additionally, there are examples of verbs with subject markers that interact with negation.

For instance, in Paragraph 3, it is stated: ""The most general negator is tǝle, which negates any type of predicate. It occurs before the negated constituent: (17) Tǝle=kan [u-me ubi] NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø ‘He didn’t use to work’"". This indicates that the negator ""tǝle"" can be used with verbs and is phonologically bound to them through clitics.

Moreover, Paragraph 7 provides an example of a negated clause: ""(91) Samǝtmǝrun lǝ [tǝle u-me ubi]. RELR NEG 3mS-HAB work=Ø. ‘Samǝtmǝrun didn’t work.’"" Here, ""tǝle"" is used directly before the verb phrase, indicating its role in standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Imonda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Imonda can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the suffix ""-m"" is used as a negation marker and attaches to the verb. This is evident in several examples:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that the suffix ""-m"" serves both as a negation and an interrogative marker.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples where the suffix ""-m"" is used in negation: ""puhG-i-me"" (NEG come up-PST-NEG) meaning ""Muit did not turn up.""
- Paragraph 4 states that the negative imperative or prohibitive is formed discontinuously by the free particle ""an"" and the negative suffix ""-m.""
- Paragraph 10 further confirms the use of ""-m"" in prohibitive constructions: ""sebuhe-nanne an fa-ne-n-m"" (evil-POS food PROH CL-eat-BEN/NS-NEG) meaning ""do not eat the food of the devils.""

These examples demonstrate that the suffix ""-m"" is phonologically bound to the verb and is used to mark negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Nimboran can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 6** provides a clear example of negation involving a verb form:
   - ""bekdbaku kuo be, u6Mku - I did not kick above, I dibbled above.""
   - In this example, ""kuo"" appears to be a separate word used for negation, but it is not phonologically bound to the verb. However, the presence of ""be"" in the negated form ""bekdbaku kuo be"" suggests that there is a morphological change or addition to the verb form itself when negation is applied.

2. **Paragraph 7** also supports this by showing the structure of verb forms:
   - ""13guadu, 13g1£at1£, and 13guaku to 13guapu - I bit.""
   - The morpheme ""-p-"" in ""13guapu"" indicates a past action, and the structure suggests that verb forms in Nimboran can be modified by adding morphemes to indicate different grammatical categories, including potentially negation.

3. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of morphemes like ""-d-"", ""-t-"", and ""-k-"" to indicate tense:
   - This indicates that Nimboran verbs are morphologically complex and can be modified by adding specific morphemes to convey different meanings, which implies that negation could also be marked in a similar way.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that standard negation in Nimboran can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Abun,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abun is primarily marked by the use of particles rather than affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. The primary negative particle is ""nde,"" which is used in conjunction with another particle ""yo"" to bracket the predicate in negative indicative sentences. This bracketing strategy is consistent and invariant, as described in multiple paragraphs.

- Paragraph 4 mentions that the negative particle ""nde"" occurs after the predicate, including any subordinate clauses.
- Paragraph 5 explicitly states that there are no affixes used to negate words in Abun.
- Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 9 emphasize that ""nde"" and ""yo"" are particles that bracket the predicate to form negation.
- Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 12 further confirm that ""nde"" is not attached to the verb and is a clause-final particle.

Given this information, it is evident that negation in Abun is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb but rather by separate particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Meryam Mir,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Meryam Mir can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 12 (5.6 Negation) provides clear examples of how negation is expressed in the language. The negation particle ""nole"" or ""ne"" precedes the verb and is used to negate an event. This particle is phonologically bound to the verb, as it directly precedes it and forms a syntactic unit with it. Here are some examples from the text:

- (5.77) ""wi kikem-ge le nole umer-kak da-r(a)a"" - 'They did not know at first.'
- (5.78) ""e ne tabra mamorser tabra bud itkiri op-ge"" - 'She did not properly wipe off the mud on her face.'
- (5.79) ""ma nole abi dip0"" - 'Don't dob him in.'

These examples demonstrate that the negation particle is phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Hatam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the standard negation in Hatam is marked by the negative adverb ""big,"" which is always in clause-final position. There is no evidence from the given paragraphs that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples consistently show ""big"" as a separate word at the end of the clause, not attached to the verb or modifying it directly.

**Reasoning:**
1. Paragraph 3: ""Negation can be intensified to convey the sense of 'not at all'... combining the perception verb kan 'know' with the negative: ... kan big.""
2. Paragraph 4: ""The strictly final position of the negative implies that any negative sentence... allows more than one interpretation, depending on whether the scope of the negation includes the main or the subordinate predicate.""
3. Paragraph 6: ""Even if pragmatically some meanings are less likely, negation of main verb or complement is equally possible for such constructions.""
4. Paragraph 10: ""The negation of the purposive or resultative sequences has as its most likely scope the secondary predicate.""
5. Paragraph 11: ""Adverbs that are always clause-final are the aspectual tulsu 'already' and the negatives.""
6. Paragraph 18: ""The point of all these examples is to illustrate that... the position of the negative adverb is rigidly sentence-final.""

These paragraphs indicate that the negative marker ""big"" is a separate word that appears at the end of the clause, rather than an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Kwomtari,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, it is evident that standard negation in Kwomtari can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix ""-i"" is used as a negating suffix on verbs, as seen in the following examples:

- Paragraph 4: ""The adverb glei ‘not’ negates the predicate and is usually found as the initial element in the predicate. Glei is used in conjunction with the clause final negative suffix -i, which is discussed further in §7.2.""
- Paragraph 9: ""If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being preceded by glei. It appears that -i is used to give clarification as to how much of a sentence is being negated, since the scope of glei can extend over more than one verb. Note that when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i is evident.""

These examples clearly show that the suffix ""-i"" is used to mark negation on verbs, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Inanwatan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions the negative suffix ""-aigo"" that attaches to the verb to indicate negation. Paragraph 2 provides an example of this suffix in use: ""ne-se-s-aigo"" (I am not going to walk), where ""-aigo"" is the negative suffix attached to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 5 mentions the verb form ""-eri-aigo"" used in negative attributive-equative clauses, further supporting the presence of a negative suffix.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iau,"1. Based on the given paragraphs, standard negation in the language Iau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several instances:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative particle ""ae"" and ""ai"" immediately following the verb or the verb and the clitic stative particle if present. For example, ""Y⁸ bui² i⁷ ai⁹ y⁴"" (We didn't /never did go upstream) and ""A⁹ to⁶ i⁷ ae⁵"" (I did not go at all).
- Paragraph 2 reiterates that negatives in Iau are marked by the particles ""ae"" and ""ai"" which follow the verb.
- Paragraph 6 provides examples of negative constructions where the negative particle ""ae"" is used immediately after the verb, such as ""Au⁷ da⁷ di⁸ ae⁵"" (He did not kill the dog).

These examples demonstrate that negation in Iau involves particles that are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the relevant information for determining the method of standard negation in Karkar-Yuri is sparse and somewhat unclear. However, there are a few points that can be analyzed:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph is quite jumbled and difficult to parse. It mentions various grammatical elements but does not provide clear information about negation.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses clitics and their attachment to pronouns but does not provide specific information about negation.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions interrogative constructions and the use of clitics in questions but does not address negation.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph mentions negation in a phrase but does not provide clear examples or explanations of how negation is marked in declarative sentences with dynamic verbs.

5. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides an example sentence but does not clearly indicate how negation is marked.

6. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph mentions a construction where ""not"" is used, but it is not clear if this is a clitic, affix, or a separate word.

Given the lack of clear and direct information about the method of standard negation in Karkar-Yuri, it is not possible to definitively determine whether negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb based on the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**: The paragraphs provided do not contain sufficient or clear information about the specific method of marking standard negation in declarative sentences with dynamic verbs in Karkar-Yuri. The relevant details about negation are either missing or too ambiguous to draw a definitive conclusion.

**Conclusion**: 0",1,0
Yelî Dnye,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the negation methods in Yelî Dnye as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""The basic form used in negation is daa 'not'."" This suggests that negation involves a specific morpheme, ""daa.""

2. **Paragraph 6** provides an example of a negative future statement: ""Kele, daa -ni'ni.no NEG-IND.FUT. 1 SG.SB No, I ' m not going.go.PCT."" Here, ""daa"" is used as a prefix attached to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.

3. **Paragraph 7** shows another example: ""Ngem Kaawa NEG-D-FUT go.PCT IT.PLPRX . DU . S B. Ngem and Kaawa won 't be going."" Again, ""NEG-D-FUT"" indicates that negation involves a prefix attached to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of negation in sentences: ""Ndende nge] M IJl 1amal L(20 1 )de-nooya.his knowledge NEG-CI . REM. 1 SG .SB sitting M true He really didn' t know me."" and ""daa [Post Office]A [a 1amal L my knowledge C I . PRES . 3 . S B . NEG standing Post Office I don't know where the Post Office is."" In these examples, ""NEG-CI"" and ""NEG standing"" show that negation is marked by a prefix.

5. **Paragraph 16** states, ""The negative < daa> has different surface forms, depending on its environment,"" which implies that ""daa"" can be modified based on its phonological or syntactic context, further supporting the idea that negation involves a bound morpheme.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yelî Dnye can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. The morpheme ""daa"" is used as a prefix in various forms to indicate negation, and it is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Sentani can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 4** explicitly mention the presence of a negative circumfix in Sentani:
   - ""The category has two members: the ventive prefix, m- VENT, which indicates motion towards the position of the speaker, and the negative circumfix, ə- -j NEG, which negates the verb.""
   - ""The negative, ə- -j NEG, also attaches directly to the verb root, but due to its infrequency it cannot be said whether it is reserved to the first verb root of the verbal complex. The negative circumfix only negates the verb itself, rather than having scope over the entire sentence.""

2. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** further confirm the use of the negative circumfix:
   - ""Lastly, the habitual circumfix j- -jə attaches to the first suffix that follows the verb root. The circumfix attaches to this suffix regardless of its category, with the exception of the modal suffixes, which are always at the end of a verbal complex.""
   - ""The negative circumfix ə- -j NEG attaches to the verb root.""

These paragraphs clearly indicate that the negative circumfix ə- -j is used to negate verbs in Sentani, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the standard negation in Mpur is marked by the adverb ""jan,"" which always occurs clause-finally. There is no evidence in the given text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The examples provided consistently show ""jan"" as a separate word at the end of the clause, indicating that it is not phonologically bound to the verb.

Here are the relevant points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: ""The adverb of negation jan always occurs clause-finally.""
   - Example: ""De-unot Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem jan."" (They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.)

2. **Paragraph 3**: ""This utterance can be disambiguated by positioning the negative element directly following the predicate of the main clause.""
   - Example: ""De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem."" (They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.)

3. **Paragraph 4**: ""The negation of mu is ku jan 'at not' or (n-)ka jan '(3SF-)there not'.""
   - Example: ""Ben-don-kopaw bardokube mamir ku jan-e."" (But I myself chopped things for nothing, there is nobody.)

4. **Paragraph 5**: ""A modifying relative clause is normally introduced by the relative marker ma, occupying the position of the postnominal modifiers. In the following example, a nominal predication is presented followed by a negation which obligatorily follows the nominal predicate.""
   - Example: ""Iwma-n-kakokor jan."" (This bird is not a chicken.)

Given these examples, it is clear that the negation is marked by the adverb ""jan,"" which is a separate word and not an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Mehek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mehek can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the suffix `-nak` is used to mark negation directly on the verb. This is evident from multiple examples provided in the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1: ""One of the ways of expressing negation is by adding a suffix -nak to the verb...""
- Paragraph 2: ""...it occasionally co-occurs with a suffix -nak on the verb...""
- Paragraph 4: ""The second negative construction is one in which there is both the negative word iki and a negative suffix -nak on the verb...""
- Paragraph 6: ""...the suffix -nak attaches directly to the verb stem...""

These examples demonstrate that the suffix `-nak` is phonologically bound to the verb and is used to mark negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Abui,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Abui can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the verb ""naha"" (meaning 'not be' or 'NEG') is used to negate clauses. This verb follows the negated verb phrase (VP) and is glossed as NEG. For example, in the sentence ""neenaha"" (eat-NEG), ""naha"" follows the verb ""nee"" (eat) to indicate negation. This indicates that negation is marked by a separate verb rather than an affix or clitic directly attached to the main verb.

Reasoning:
- Paragraph 1 explicitly states that ""Abui clause is negated with the verb naha ‘not be’"" and provides examples where ""naha"" follows the main verb to negate the clause.
- Paragraph 4 further supports this by showing ""naha"" used in various contexts to negate clauses.
- There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs of negation being marked by an affix or clitic directly attached to the main verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the information relevant to the marking of standard negation in Arapesh (Abu).

**Paragraph 2** provides an example of a negative sentence:
- ""kk-u -k -a -ha -' 3SGFA -IR-NONPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU 'She did not hit her.'""
- The gloss includes ""uwa'"" which is translated as 'not'.

**Paragraph 3** mentions two forms used to express negation:
- ""uwa' ‘not’ and duwa’ ‘nothing’.""

**Paragraph 9** discusses the prohibitive mood and provides an example:
- ""nn -i -k -a -he' ko'isi' ‘Don't go.’""
- Here, ""ko'isi'"" is used as a negative imperative.

**Paragraph 17** mentions the future tense marker {-k-}, but does not provide direct information about negation.

From the examples and descriptions, it is evident that negation in Arapesh (Abu) involves the use of the word ""uwa'"" to express 'not'. However, there is no clear indication that this negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, ""uwa'"" appears to function as a separate word (particle) that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine definitively whether standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The examples and descriptions suggest that negation is expressed through separate particles rather than bound morphemes.

**Reasoning:**
- The examples provided show negation using separate particles like ""uwa'"" and ""ko'isi'"".
- There is no evidence of affixes or clitics attached to the verb to indicate negation.
- The descriptions do not mention any modification of the verb itself for negation.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Korafe,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Korafe can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation with -ae**: Multiple paragraphs indicate that the negative deverbal form in Korafe is created by adding the suffix -ae to the verb stem. For instance:
   - Paragraph 2: ""predications that are statements (4.90) and questions (4.91) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae 'not do' at the terminus.""
   - Paragraph 3: ""The negative deverbal is an essential constituent of all negative predications.""
   - Paragraph 6: ""The derivation formative -ae combines with stem I to form the negative deverbal.""
   - Paragraph 8: ""Negation of predications in Korafe is usually signalled by the combination of the negative focus marker jo 'not' and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative deverbal ae 'not doing' at its terminus.""

2. **Modification of the Verb**: The verb itself is modified to express negation by attaching the negative deverbal suffix -ae. This is evident in examples like:
   - Paragraph 6: ""Nu jo namane s-aoro siror-ae=ri"" ('It wasn't we that caused him to be born').
   - Paragraph 8: ""Na jo ning-ae=ri"" ('I didn't hear (what was said)').

3. **Phonologically Bound Elements**: The negative deverbal -ae is phonologically bound to the verb, as it forms a single morphological unit with the verb stem.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Korafe can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Alamblak by examining the relevant information about how negation is marked in the language.

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions a morphological negative form in the hortative present tense verb, with a possible exception for the declarative present verb with the suffix ""-kah."" This indicates that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix.

2. **Paragraph 5** discusses negation particles like ""finji,"" ""afe,"" and ""tafite,"" which are used in negative clauses. However, these particles are not phonologically bound to the verb and thus do not count as affixes or clitics.

3. **Paragraph 6** provides an example of a sentence with negation marked by ""finji,"" but again, this is a separate word and not an affix or clitic.

4. **Paragraph 7** mentions that the negative particle in the clause is optional and refers to ""afe"" as a ""Negative of Uncertainty."" This does not provide evidence of an affix or clitic.

5. **Paragraph 13** gives an example of a negative hortative verb form with the suffix ""-wah,"" indicating that negation can be marked by an affix.

From the information provided, it is clear that Alamblak can mark standard negation by a modification of the verb or an affix, specifically in the hortative present tense and possibly in the declarative present tense.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 13 provide evidence that negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb in certain verb forms.
- The presence of the suffix ""-kah"" in the declarative present verb and ""-wah"" in the hortative present verb indicates that negation can be marked by an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the standard negation in I'saka is marked by the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears clause-finally. This particle is not attached to the verb as an affix or clitic but rather stands as a separate word at the end of the clause. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It states that negation is expressed with the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears clause-finally. Examples provided show ""mi"" at the end of the clause, not attached to the verb.
   - Example: ""k-ei Pi mi"" ('It won't rain.')

2. **Paragraph 3**: It reiterates that negation is marked once per clause and always at the end of the clause, following the predicate and any oblique nominals.
   - Example: ""Di wii-na mi"" ('I'm not sick.')

3. **Paragraph 4**: It mentions that the negative particle ""mi"" is clause-final and not verb-final, indicating that it is not bound to the verb.
   - Example: ""Depu d-ele'-le' ycmg-ri mi"" ('I'm not up to going on foot.')

4. **Paragraph 5**: It discusses the scope of the negative marker ""mi,"" further confirming its position at the end of the clause and not as an affix or clitic on the verb.
   - Example: ""Tani' k-ele' moni' tro pli mi"" ('Dad went to the garden without Mum.')

Given these points, it is evident that the negation in I'saka is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb but by a separate clause-final particle ""mi.""

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Urim. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""The verbal negator ake can occur either immediately before or after the subject (more usual in texts), but if the subject is prominent and therefore fronted, then ake always occurs between it and the verb.""
   - Example: ""Ake kil atning"" (NEG 3sg listen.R) translates to ""He did not listen.""
   - Example: ""Tu ake kai anong"" (3pl NEG go village) translates to ""They did not go to village/home.""

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""Negation is usually considered part of verb phrase. In Urim the verbal negator ake normally occurs immediately before the verb (or serial verb phrase), but is often also placed first in the clause, especially in answers.""
   - Example: ""Kil ake kul"" (3sg NEG come) translates to ""She did not come.""

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is specific.""
   - Example: ""Kupm ake num wakget, kalpis."" (1sg NEG skin hot, not) translates to ""I do not have fever.""

4. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""In Urim transitive verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e. These suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or semitransitive.""

From these points, it is clear that the standard negation in Urim involves the use of the negator ""ake,"" which is a particle that can occur before or after the subject and before the verb. This negator is not an affix or clitic but a separate word. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that negation is marked by a modification of the verb itself or by an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
0",0,0
Abau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, it is evident that standard negation in Abau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 3**: Examples (32) to (34) show the use of the negation markers ""pey"" and ""pa"" which occur clause-finally. These markers are used to negate clauses with imperfective and perfective aspects, respectively. The examples illustrate that these markers are phonologically bound to the verb phrase, indicating that they function as clitics or affixes.
  
- **Paragraph 6**: Example (18) demonstrates the use of the imperfective negation marker ""pey"" in a verbal clause, which is attached to the verb phrase. This further supports the presence of negation markers that are phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 4**: Example (37) shows the use of ""pa"" as a perfective negation marker following the verb ""hin"" (shoot), indicating that ""pa"" is an affix or clitic bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 14**: The prohibitive construction using ""pese ... o"" also shows that negation markers can bracket the verb phrase, further indicating that negation can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb.

These examples collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Abau can indeed be marked by affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Chamorro,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Chamorro can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Chamorro has three ways of expressing sentence negation: with the sentential negative ""ti,"" with a negative verb, or with a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. This suggests that negation can be directly associated with the verb or other elements in the sentence.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples where ""ti"" is used to negate sentences. The examples show ""ti"" preceding the verb, indicating that it is a separate word rather than an affix or clitic. However, it also mentions a negative verb, which implies that negation can be incorporated into the verb itself.

3. **Paragraph 5** discusses negative concord and provides examples where the negative verb ""tåya’"" (meaning 'not exist') is used. This verb inherently carries negation, indicating that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb.

4. **Paragraph 6** gives examples of sentences with the negative verb ""tåya’"" and the sentential negative ""ti."" The use of ""tåya’"" as a negative verb further supports the idea that negation can be marked by a modification of the verb.

5. **Paragraph 13** mentions that the negative ""ti"" is phonologically dependent and must lean on material to its right, indicating that it is not an affix or clitic but a separate word. However, it also mentions the predicate ""mungnga"" (meaning 'don’t, let it not be'), which is another example of a negative verb.

6. **Paragraph 18** discusses negative indefinites formed by combining the word-level negative ""ni"" with an indefinite noun phrase. While this does not directly address verb modification, it shows another method of expressing negation in Chamorro.

From these points, it is clear that Chamorro uses negative verbs (e.g., ""tåya’,"" ""mungnga"") to express negation, which involves modifying the verb to include negation. Therefore, standard negation in Chamorro can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Awtuw,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Awtuw can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions the negative prefix ""ka-"" or ""ki-"" that can fill the first slot in the verb complex to negate any verbal predicate. Paragraph 3 further elaborates that morphological negation with ""ka-"" or ""k�-"" is the usual strategy for negating any clause with a verbal predicate. Examples such as ""Awt i y k�-w- �y - re"" (Awtiy NG-NF-go-FU, 'Awtiy isn’t going') and ""Awt i y- re wan k a - d - uwpo-ka"" (Awtiy-o lSG NG-FA-See-PF, 'I haven’t seen Awtiy') clearly demonstrate the use of a negative prefix attached to the verb to indicate negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mian can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative clitic `=ba` is used to express negation in clauses containing a finite verb. This clitic follows the subject suffix or the tense suffix in the post-subject slot, as shown in examples (198) and (199). Additionally, the clitic `=ba` is always the last formative in the verb before the illocutionary particle, as mentioned in Paragraph 5. This indicates that the negation is indeed marked by a phonologically bound element to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Chácobo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that the marker of verbal and clausal negation is =yáma ‘negation’ in all other construction types. It also states that the morpheme -ma expresses negation or antonymity when it combines with adjectives and certain nominalized verbs. This indicates that =yáma can be used as a clitic for negation in verbal constructions.

2. **Paragraph 4**: The example (13.103) shows the use of =yáma as a clitic attached to the verb ""see"" (1SGsee=NEG=DEC:P), indicating that negation is marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides an example (5.76a) where the negation morpheme =yáma is used in the construction ""ka=yó=yáma=kɨ"" (go=CMPL=NEG=DEC:P), showing that =yáma is a clitic attached to the verb ""go"".

4. **Paragraph 9**: The example (13.21) shows the use of =yáma as a clitic in the construction ""tʃaniyáma=bɨkí=kɨ"" (speak NEG=INTRC1=DEC:P), further supporting that negation is marked by a clitic attached to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph explicitly states that verbs combine with the negative marker =yama ‘negative’, indicating that negation is marked by a clitic attached to the verb.

6. **Paragraph 14**: The table in this paragraph lists yáma as a negation morpheme that can combine with verb stems, indicating that it functions as a clitic in the verb stratum.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Hup can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -nˆ¤h is used exclusively with verbal predicates to negate the verb phrase. This suffix attaches directly to the verb stem, replacing other suffixes that would typically appear in affirmative clauses.

Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It describes the negative suffix -nˆ¤h as a verbal consonant-initial Boundary Suffix that receives primary stress within the verb word. It is used in declarative clauses to negate the verb, replacing other obligatory Boundary Suffixes in affirmative clauses.
   
2. **Paragraph 6**: It explicitly states that the most common form of negation in Hup involves the negative suffix -nˆ¤h, which occurs as a suffix on the verb stem and is used exclusively for negating the verb phrase predicate.

3. **Paragraph 13**: It provides examples of the negative suffix -nˆ¤h being used with verbs to form negative clauses, such as ""ham-nˆ¤h"" (go-NEG) meaning ""I never go.""

4. **Paragraph 14**: It gives further examples of the negative suffix -nˆ¤h being used in negative future constructions, such as ""ham-nˆ¤h-ay"" (go-NEG-INCH) meaning ""I’m not going.""

5. **Paragraph 15**: It discusses the scope of the negative suffix -nˆ¤h within verb compounds, indicating that it typically negates the entire verbal predicate.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that the negative suffix -nˆ¤h is an affix that attaches to the verb to mark negation in Hup.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Kwaza,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Kwaza can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple examples where the negative morpheme -he- is used as a suffix attached to the verb to indicate negation. For instance:

- In Paragraph 1, the example (2796) ""ja-'he-da-ki"" (eat-NEG-1S-DEC) translates to ""I did not eat,"" showing that the negation is marked by the suffix -he- attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 also provides examples such as (2836) ""'e-da-hͿ-'he-ki"" (have-1S-NOM-NEG-DEC) translating to ""that I don’t eat,"" where the negation is marked by the suffix -he-.
- Paragraph 12 explicitly states that ""Negation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-,"" and provides examples like (2754) ""awͿi-'he-da-ki"" (see-NEG-1S-DEC) translating to ""I haven’t seen him.""

These examples consistently show that the negative morpheme -he- is used as a suffix attached to the verb to mark negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Huambisa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huambisa can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, paragraphs 1 and 3 provide direct evidence of this:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that the negative verbal morpheme -t͡ʃa is attached to the copula itself, and the suffix -t͡ʃa is a non-present negative marker, with -tsu used for present tense.
- Paragraph 3 further elaborates that there are two negative suffixes on the verb in Wampis (Huambisa): -t͡ʃa and -t͡su, which are used in different morphosyntactic contexts.

These paragraphs clearly indicate that negation in Huambisa involves the use of affixes that attach to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Cocama,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Cocama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs describe two negative particles, **tɨma** and **ni**, which are used to negate clauses, verb phrases, and specific arguments. 

- **Paragraph 2** (9.3.1. Constructions with tɨma) explains that **tɨma** can negate the whole clause, verb phrases, adverbs, and noun phrases. Examples show **tɨma** preceding verbs and verb phrases, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb or the clause it negates.
- **Paragraph 3** (9.3.2. Constructions with ni) describes **ni** as primarily negating single units, generally core arguments of the clause, and sometimes the verb phrase. Examples show **ni** preceding verbs and verb phrases, indicating that it is also phonologically bound to the verb or the clause it negates.
- **Paragraph 6** (8.1.1.2. Negation and juxtaposition constructions) further supports this by showing **tɨma** placed between two noun phrases to negate the predicate, indicating its role in negating verb phrases and clauses.

These descriptions and examples demonstrate that negation in Cocama involves particles that are phonologically bound to the verb or the clause, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation through affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Tiriyo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiriyo, we can determine that standard negation in the language can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5** provides clear examples of negative forms that involve modifications of the verb:
   - The sentences show the use of the negative suffix ""-ewa"" attached to the verb stem to indicate negation. For instance:
     - ""in-akoronma-ewa"" (I am not helping him/her)
     - ""i-kéhtun-jewa"" (You are not screaming)
     - ""e-pé-ewa"" (I am not bathing)
   - These examples demonstrate that negation is marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6** further supports this by discussing the use of the negative suffix ""-sewa"" in habitual past forms and other contexts:
   - For example, ""mure_me_nkéré wi ahtao, pahko imoi-jewa wi"" (When I was a child, I used not to obey my father) shows the negative suffix ""-jewa"" attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 8** mentions the historical derivation of the negative suffix ""-sewa"" from the negative particle ""wa,"" indicating that the negative suffix is a common morphological marker for negation in verbs.

4. **Paragraph 10** confirms that negative constructions in Tiriyo are copular clauses built around the negative form of the verb, which involves the use of negative verb forms.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Tiriyo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ticuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ticuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention the use of the negative marker ""tãů"" which is a particle that can be attached to the verb to indicate negation. For example, in Paragraph 3, it is stated: ""Standard negation (also ascriptive and non-topical locational negation) (7.2.1) adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ to the corresponding positive clause."" This indicates that the negative marker ""tãů"" is used in conjunction with the verb to form a negative clause. Additionally, in Paragraph 5, the example ""Tãů tā g̃eʼ̀ ta̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́"" shows the use of ""tãů"" as a prohibitive marker attached to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Huitoto (Murui),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple instances where the standard negative marker -ñe is used as an affix attached to the verb to indicate negation in declarative sentences. For example:

- In Paragraph 3, it states: ""Negation of predicates is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’).""
- Example (10.1b) in Paragraph 3 shows the use of -ñe: ""ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED swim-NEG-LK-1sg ‘I don’t swim’.""
- Paragraph 6 further confirms this: ""Expression of negation in Murui involves morphological processes of verbal affixation of the standard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni used both in main and subordinate clauses.""

These examples and descriptions clearly indicate that the standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) is marked by an affix (-ñe) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Iquito can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""negation is expressed through a negative morpheme marked on the verb and a negative particle in the postverbal position.""
2. **Paragraph 2** states that the ""negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verbal stem followed by the tense/aspect information, followed by the negative particle caa.""
3. **Paragraph 5** provides examples showing that some negative clauses can be marked only by the negative morpheme -ji.
4. **Paragraph 6** describes the ji-caa negation strategy, where the negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verb root, and the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb.
5. **Paragraph 9** reiterates that in ji-caa negation, the verb is obligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.

These paragraphs clearly indicate that the negative morpheme -ji is an affix that attaches to the verb to mark negation. Therefore, standard negation in Iquito can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Movima,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Movima can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate that the negative particle ""kas"" is used in combination with action nominalization, which involves the suffix ""-wa"" or infixing reduplication. This nominalization process modifies the verb to express negation. Additionally, the irrealis infix ""<a’>"" is used in negative contexts to indicate the non-existence of the absolutive participant, further showing that negation involves morphological changes to the verb.

For example:
- In Paragraph 1, it is mentioned that ""the predicate either contains a negative element, or it is converted into a relational noun by action nominalization.""
- Paragraph 3 provides examples such as ""kas joro-wa=n"" (NEG sleep-NMZ=2) and ""kas cha’~cha’-wa"" (NEG INV~pierce-NMZ), illustrating the use of the suffix ""-wa"" for negation.
- Paragraph 6 discusses the irrealis marker ""<a’>"", which is used in negative contexts, as seen in examples like ""kas tij-a’-ka:rim"" (NEG work_at-IRR-BE.utensiles).

These examples demonstrate that negation in Movima involves morphological modifications to the verb, either through suffixation or infixation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Affixation of -thm (neg)**:
   - Paragraph 1: Examples like ""akpakhmnm-thm-(nè)"" (yawn-neg-(n)) and ""a:hi§è-thé-thm-(nè)"" (eat-go.do-neg-(n)) clearly show that the suffix -thm is used to mark negation on verbs.
   - Paragraph 3: It is stated that ""A finite verb or predicate complement is negated by placing high tone on its first syllable and suffixing -© thm-ne (-tune) ‘negative-(n)’ or simply -© thm. (-tu).""
   - Paragraph 6: The morpheme -© ©ne (n) is suffixed to the verbs of negative sentences, indicating that negation involves affixation.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 3: The process of negation involves placing a high tone on the first syllable of the verb, which is a modification of the verb itself.

3. **Examples of Negation**:
   - Paragraph 3: Examples like ""phé:-thm-nè"" (go-neg-(n)) and ""max$ho-thm-(nè)"" (eat-neg-(n)) show the use of the suffix -thm for negation.
   - Paragraph 6: The example ""max$ho-ti-(pè)"" (eat-neg-(n)) further illustrates the use of the suffix -thm for negation.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Wari',"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the methods of standard negation in Wari'. Here are the key points relevant to determining if negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’ that can appear in simple sentences.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of 'om ‘to not exist’ as a common way to express negation, and mentions the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’ for double negation.
3. **Paragraph 6** states that 'om ‘to not exist’ is used as the leftmost member of a verb compound for negation.
4. **Paragraph 9** provides an example where 'om is used in a compound verb structure to express negation.
5. **Paragraph 13** shows an example where 'axiron (eat-neg) is used to express ""He should not eat it.""

From these points, it is clear that Wari' uses both a postverbal modifier ('a/'ara) and a verb compound structure with 'om to express negation. The use of 'om as part of a verb compound and the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara indicate that negation can indeed be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
- The postverbal modifier 'a/'ara is a bound morpheme that attaches to the verb to indicate negation.
- The verb compound structure with 'om also shows that negation can be marked by modifying the verb phrase.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Aymara (Central). Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: ""In negative constructions, the particles... to negative jani. The verb to the declarative negative form but in the 1st person singular and plural -ta replaces e.g.""
2. **Paragraph 8**: ""Note the shift of negative -ti from the verb to jani in negative interrogative.""
3. **Paragraph 16**: ""Nayanjjinasjan jachafiajjucchiniti.+ ~chini>+ negative-ti..infix -n- (nayanii) contracted to jan:‘4.""
4. **Paragraph 17**: ""Analysis: or: all but third person forms: verb stem + (plural infix) ending + negative -ti. + negative all forms except-ca~. + -ayd- + the first person verb stem + (plural infix) + -ca- + -an- + ending + -ti. 1st person forms: ~atan- + -ti. verb (N.B. Rudimentos gives ending: e.g.""

From these points, it is clear that the negative morpheme ""-ti"" is used in negative constructions and is affixed to the verb. This indicates that standard negation in Aymara (Central) can indeed be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- Paragraph 2 mentions the use of ""-ta"" in the 1st person singular and plural for negative constructions.
- Paragraph 8 discusses the negative suffix ""-ti"" and its attachment to the verb.
- Paragraph 16 and 17 further confirm the use of the negative suffix ""-ti"" with verbs, showing that it is a bound morpheme.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Trumai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Trumai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation particle ""tak"" is used to negate verbal predicates, as seen in multiple examples where ""tak"" follows the verb or verb phrase. This particle is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

For instance, in Paragraph 4, it is stated: ""to negate verbal predicates, the Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as auxiliaries."" This is further supported by examples such as:
- (11) ""hai-tschi(_in)Negkuhmu tak"" (Negation particle ""tak"" follows the verb ""kuhmu"").
- (28) ""[kifi] tak hat’ke hai-tstahu yi"" (Negation particle ""tak"" follows the verb ""hat’ke"").

Additionally, Paragraph 9 provides another example:
- (29) ""amitakka_inchi-n"" (speak Neg Foc/Tens Cop-3Abs) where ""tak"" follows the verb ""ami"" (speak).

These examples clearly show that the negation particle ""tak"" is used to negate verbs directly, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Apinayé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Apinayé can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 provide crucial evidence for this conclusion. 

Paragraph 1 states that ""Negation of intransitive (77-78) and transitive (79) verbal predicates is invariably encoded by the clitic sequence ket=ne."" This indicates that the clitic sequence ket=ne is phonologically bound to the verb and is used to mark negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Paragraph 3 provides examples of this usage:
- (77.b) ""pa kt paj ic-pikud ket=ne"" translates to ""I won’t get lost,"" where ket=ne is used to negate the verb ""ic-pikud.""
- (78.b) ""naEpa a-t- ket=ne"" translates to ""I didn’t dream about you,"" where ket=ne is used to negate the verb ""a-t-.""
- (79.b) ""naØ [i-kaw kr] katr ket=ne"" translates to ""S/he didn’t cover (the inside of) his/her basket,"" where ket=ne is used to negate the verb ""katr.""

These examples clearly show that the clitic sequence ket=ne is used to negate verbs in Apinayé, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving dynamic verbal predicates.

Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the information to determine if standard negation in Yagua can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Paragraph 3:**
This paragraph mentions that ""negation, modals, desideratives and volitionals may appear marked on the verb."" This suggests that negation can be marked directly on the verb, possibly through affixation or modification.

**Paragraph 11:**
This paragraph provides an example of negation: ""NééThe nééformtoarimityoodadéérty.riy-jyuvay-muuy rimityu-jada-dee-ryy NEG 3PL-kil1-COMPLT JIITA old:one-FEMININE-DIM-dear 'The didn't kill the old lady’."" The gloss indicates that ""néé"" is a negative particle that precedes the verb. However, it does not specify if ""néé"" is an affix or a clitic bound to the verb.

**Paragraph 14:**
This paragraph lists various clitics and affixes, including ""negative."" This suggests that there is a specific negative morpheme that can be attached to the verb.

**Paragraph 16:**
This paragraph mentions ""Negation and modals"" but does not provide specific details on how negation is marked.

**Paragraph 17:**
This paragraph lists ""Negation"" as a category but does not provide specific details on its marking.

From the information provided, particularly from Paragraphs 3, 11, and 14, it is evident that negation in Yagua can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Paragraph 3 explicitly states that negation can be marked on the verb, and Paragraph 14 lists a negative morpheme among other clitics and affixes.

Cacua,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in the language Cacua can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation suffix -kan/-kap is used to mark negation on verbs in declarative sentences. For example, in Paragraph 1, the sentence ""wã=beh-kan=tʃãhãp"" translates to ""I am not going,"" where -kan is the negation suffix attached to the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 3 provides another example: ""wã=ʔɨbʔ-kan=na=hĩ"" meaning ""I didn’t take them out,"" where -kan is again used as a negation suffix on the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuracare,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuracare can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative adverb ""nish/nij"" is used before the verb phrase, and there are instances where negation is marked directly on the verb with affixes or clitics. For example, in Paragraph 1, the clause ""nishbobo‐ø=w=ya"" shows the use of ""nish"" (NEG) before the verb ""bobo"" (hit/kill), and the verb is marked with subject and tense markers. Additionally, the examples in Paragraph 1 demonstrate that the negative adverb ""nish/nij"" can be used with verbs, auxiliaries, and other constituents, indicating that negation is closely tied to the verb phrase.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Kuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Kuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) can be added to the verb to negate a sentence. This is a clear indication that negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Example: ""An immal pakchul."" (I did not buy a thing.)

2. **Paragraph 14** provides further examples of sentences negated by the suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul attached to the verb.
   - Example: ""An nejul."" (I did not see Mother.)

3. **Paragraph 16** mentions that a desiderative action may be negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb.
   - Example: ""An yapa mol pak."" (I don't want to buy cloth.)

These examples and explanations confirm that standard negation in Kuna can indeed be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Uru,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Uru can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Affixation and Clitics**: Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negation ""ana"" combined with the affirmative clitic ""-pini"" to form ""ana-pini,"" which negates the verb phrase. This combination is seen in examples such as ""ana-pini culu xala-m kuna-cu-cay"" ('We [certainly] did not kill any lama.') and ""ana-pini sek-cay"" ('There is [truly] not much.'). The use of ""-pini"" as a clitic that attaches to ""ana"" indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic in Uru.

- **Modification of the Verb**: Paragraph 2 further supports this by showing that ""ana"" can be inflected with other clitics like ""-cay"" (declarative) and ""-kala"" (certainty), as seen in ""ana-kala ci cuna"" ('it is [certainly] not good'). This inflection process involves attaching clitics directly to the negation marker, which is closely related to the verb phrase.

- **Negation in Verb Phrases**: Paragraph 6 provides an example where ""ana"" is used in a verb phrase, ""ana tulun kun-tani okwfaj-aki-cay"" ('Won't you (sg) go with grief?'), showing that negation can be directly associated with the verb.

- **Negation with Personal Clitics**: Paragraph 16 shows the use of ""ana"" with personal clitics, as in ""ana-l t(a)xa-cay wir-ki"" ('Today, I did not sleep.'), indicating that negation can be marked by clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Given these examples, it is clear that standard negation in Uru can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, it is evident that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by modifications of the verb or by affixes/clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Verbal Morphology of Negation**:
   - Paragraph 1 (9.3) explicitly states that ""negation can be shown by verbal morphology"" and provides examples where verbs are marked with negative prefixes such as ""ke-"" and ""at-"".
   - Paragraph 2 (9.3.2) further elaborates on the negative verbal morphology, showing examples where verbs are prefixed with ""ke-"" and ""at-"" to indicate negation.
   - Paragraph 3 (4.9.6) mentions the prefix ""nt-"" used for negation on verbs, indicating that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

2. **Examples of Negation in Verbs**:
   - Paragraph 3 (133) provides multiple examples where negation is marked on the verb with prefixes like ""ye-n-j-oshma"" (3SG.DIS-NEG-VBLZ-lay.eggs) and ""mo-n-j-obemas"" (3PL-NEG-VBLZ-become).
   - Paragraph 5 (130) shows the use of ""ke-"" and ""at-"" in verbs like ""ke-ts-at-abowenyná"" (IRR-1SG-NEG-remember) to indicate negation.

3. **Presence of Clitics and Affixes**:
   - The use of clitics and affixes is evident in the examples provided, such as ""ndoñ ke-s̈-at-amënts̈na"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-tired) and ""ndoñ ki-n-at-apten"" (NEG IRR-EVI-NEG-rain), where the negation is marked by affixes attached to the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, it is clear that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
2. **Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Warao,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Warao can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, paragraph 2 provides explicit information about the negation marker `-naka` which is suffixed to the verb root to express negation. This negation marker is directly attached to the verb root and is followed by other markers such as mood, aspect, and tense markers on the auxiliary verb `ta`. Examples such as ""hirima nao-naka ta-te"" (Your father does not come) and ""ine namina-naka ta-bu-te"" (I really do not know) illustrate this usage.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 7** mentions the verb clitic ""-yo"" which is glossed as 'negative'. This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negation using the morpheme ""jopa"" in various contexts, such as ""Neg: jopa P: pavbinde Cit/Neg: bara"" (not—don't-speak—no-more). While ""jopa"" appears to be a separate word in these examples, the presence of the clitic ""-yo"" in Paragraph 7 is sufficient to confirm that negation can be marked by a clitic.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Apurinã,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Apurinã can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions two types of negation: periphrastic negation and morphological negation. The morphological negation is marked with the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-,"" which attaches to verbs to form negative constructions. This is evident in the example provided: ""m-areka-kati-nhi"" (NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT), which translates to ""The man who is bad died"" or literally ""The man who is 'non-good' died."" This demonstrates that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.

Additionally, Paragraph 7 further supports this by describing the negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" and its function in forming negative descriptive verbs. This marker attaches to nominal or descriptive verb bases to indicate the lack of a property.

Therefore, the evidence from these paragraphs confirms that standard negation in Apurinã can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Kadiwéu. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions a proclitic +aG that attaches to the verb of the main clause for negation. This proclitic is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic.
   
   Example:
   - ""Pedro aG+y-ema:n:me medawi:"" translates to ""Peter does not want to hunt,"" where ""aG+"" is the negative marker attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 5**: It provides another example of the negative proclitic +aG attached to the verb.
   
   Example:
   - ""Maria aG+y-d:-ati-qan-t+e-wa"" translates to ""Mary killed the chicken not with her knife,"" where ""aG+"" is the negative marker attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 18**: It mentions that both aG+ and nG+ must be used to negate a conditional clause and a main clause, indicating the use of phonologically bound elements for negation.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Kadiwéu can be marked by a clitic (proclitic +aG) that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of the proclitic +aG that attaches to the verb for negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates confirms that negation can be marked by an affix or clitic.

**Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Karajá,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Karajá can be marked by an affix. Specifically, Paragraph 1 states: ""There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates the entire sentence."" This indicates that the negative morpheme -ko) is an affix that attaches to the verb to mark negation. Additionally, Paragraph 4 provides examples of this suffix in use, such as in the imperative form ""hièko)èb´)èkE"" ('Don’t cry!') and ""♂i-aÎÈTÈèo)èb´)èkre"" ('Don’t bring it down!'), further confirming that the negation is marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
