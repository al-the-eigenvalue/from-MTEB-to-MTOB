Supyire,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Supyire can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide clear evidence of this:

- Paragraph 5 (9.4. Negation): This paragraph mentions that negation in Supyire involves marking in the auxiliary position and a clause-final negative particle. Specifically, it states that ""negation is marked sentence finally with a negative particle"" and ""in most of the ΤΑΜ categories, there is some marking in the auxiliary position, either the addition of a copular auxiliary, or a tonal marking on the auxiliary already there.""

- Paragraph 15 (9.4.1.2. Negative marking in auxiliary position): This paragraph details the negative marking in the auxiliary position, mentioning that the copula ""pye"" is added in front of the perfect or progressive auxiliary to signal negation early in the clause. It also describes the use of a floating low tone introduced to the left of the auxiliary for other tense-aspects.

- Paragraph 37 (9.4.1.1. Clause final negative marking): This paragraph explains the clause-final negative particles ""mä"" and ""mi,"" which are used to mark negation at the end of the clause. It also mentions that the negative marker can change form based on the preceding noun's tone.

- Paragraph 39 (9.3.4. Ability): This paragraph provides examples of negation involving the copula ""pye"" and the clause-final negative particle ""mi,"" showing how negation is marked in different contexts.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that negation in Supyire involves modifications to the verb or the addition of phonologically bound elements (affixes or clitics) to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Jamsay,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly mentions the use of negative suffixes for both perfective and imperfective verbs. For example, the Perfective Negative is marked by the suffix -li@-, and the Imperfective Negative is marked by the suffix -go@-. These suffixes are attached directly to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by an affix.

- **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 3 by providing examples of negative inflected verbs. For instance, ""bE$rE$-go@-w"" (be.able-ImpfNeg-2SgS) and ""ya$˘-li@˘-Ø"" (go-PerfNeg-1PlS) clearly show that negation is achieved through suffixation.

- **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides further examples of negative inflection, such as ""lu$gu$ro$-jE$-lu@-m"" (I have not searched) and ""E$t-tE$-lu@˘-Ø"" (you have never seen), which again demonstrate the use of suffixes to mark negation.

- **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph shows that negation can be compatible with focalization and provides examples like ""ni $mi^˘ de$ne$-go@-m"" (cow.peas want-ImpfNeg-1SgS), where the negative suffix -go@- is used.

- **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the use of the negative suffix -la@- for adjectives and stative predicates, further indicating that negation in Jamsay is marked by affixes.

- **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph reiterates the use of the suffix -go@- for the Imperfective Negative and mentions that -a@˘ra$- and -tç@ƒç$- may also be followed directly by the stative Negative -la@-.

- **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph confirms the use of the suffix -li@- for the Perfective Negative, providing additional examples of how negation is marked by affixes.

Given the consistent evidence across multiple paragraphs that negation in Jamsay is marked by affixes directly attached to the verb, it is clear that standard negation in Jamsay can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ma'di,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Ma'di can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this comes from several paragraphs that describe the use of negation particles that are phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negation particles ""kü"" (nonpast) and ""küru"" (past) are used to negate verbs, and these particles are placed at the end of the sentence, directly following the verb. This indicates that they are phonologically bound to the verb, forming a unit with it.

For example, in Paragraph 8, it is stated:
> ""Descriptive negation is achieved by placing ku or küru at the end of the sentence. The negation particles also have focus-related behaviour, discussed in the focus chapter: icü can be used to contrastively negate a constituent of the sentence (19.10.2); both kü and küru combine with η to form freely placed adverbials (19.11). Phonologically kü fits a general pattern in Nilo-Saharan where a negative word often has the phonological structure [k]+vowel (Bender 2000: 65).""

Additionally, Paragraph 24 provides an example:
> ""NEG(N)kü can negate only an uninflected verb.
> (87) mapà IS eat Ί am not eating cassava.' gbándakü cassava NEG(N)""

This shows that the negation particle ""kü"" is directly attached to the verb, indicating that it is phonologically bound.

Paragraph 30 further supports this with:
> ""The past negation particle kuru must co-occur with an uninflected verb. The uninflected verb normally expresses past tense.
> (89) m-äwi dsóü kûrù lS-open door NEG(P) Ί did not open the door.'""

These examples demonstrate that the negation particles ""kü"" and ""küru"" are used in a way that they form a phonological unit with the verb, thus qualifying as affixes or clitics.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Bangime,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Bangime can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb and discusses its tonal effects on the verb, indicating that the negative marker is phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 3**: It states that the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb in negated verb phrases and that the tonal patterns in negated clauses are reversed compared to positive ones. This suggests that the negation affects the verb directly.
- **Paragraph 4**: Examples of negated verbs are provided, showing the negative marker [bíè] preceding the verb and affecting its tone.
- **Paragraph 6**: It discusses the presence of the negative marker [bíè] preceding the verb and mentions the tonal changes associated with negation.
- **Paragraph 9**: It confirms that the negative marker [bíè] precedes the verb and affects its tone, further supporting the phonological binding of the negation to the verb.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Bangime involves a phonologically bound element (the negative marker [bíè]) that directly affects the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Gumuz,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Gumuz can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions the existence of two negative clitics /=ŋgó/ and /=cê/ that attach to main clause verbs. Paragraph 3 further supports this by showing examples where these clitics are used to negate verbs. Additionally, Paragraph 5 discusses the structure of negative commands, which also involve the negative clitic. These clitics are phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by the lack of a phonological pause and the tonal downstep described in Paragraph 9.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Koyra Chiini (KCh) as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that simple negative clauses in KCh are expressed in the unmarked indicative mood, with the negative morpheme being the only indicator of negation. This suggests that negation is marked directly on the verb or through a morpheme closely associated with the verb.

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph lists the primary morphemes for negation in KCh, including ""si"" (ImpfNeg) and ""na"" (Neg). The morphemes are described as preverbal MAN morphemes, indicating that they are bound to the verb and form a phonological unit with it.

3. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph explicitly states that the negative morphemes ""si"" and ""na"" are part of the MAN (mood-aspect-negation) system, which follows the subject NP and immediately precedes the verb. This confirms that these negative markers are bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph describes the subjunctive mood marker ""ma"" and its negative counterpart ""ma si."" The fact that ""si"" is used as a negative marker in combination with ""ma"" further supports that ""si"" is a bound morpheme used for negation.

5. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph reiterates that the subjunctive mood can be directly negated with ""si"" following ""ma,"" reinforcing the idea that ""si"" is a bound morpheme used for negation.

6. **Paragraph 42**: This paragraph discusses the use of ""bara"" in various functions, including negation within a subjunctive clause. It mentions that negation is expressed inside the subjunctive clause, which aligns with the use of bound morphemes like ""si.""

7. **Paragraph 43**: This paragraph provides examples of negation with the morphemes ""na"" and ""si,"" showing their use in different contexts and confirming their role as bound morphemes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Koyra Chiini can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negative morphemes ""si"" and ""na"" are used as bound morphemes that attach to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Seme,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Seme (Siamou) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in the affirmative to S(Aux)OV in the negative, indicating that the verb form changes in the presence of negation.
- **Paragraph 3** shows an example where a negative auxiliary (NEG.AUX) is used, which is phonologically bound to the verb: ""ɔ se sayɛ̀"" (he NEG.AUX meat cook) meaning ""He didn't cook meat.""
- **Paragraph 6** provides another example where a negative particle (NEG.PART) is used: ""ɔ-ɔ ní na tawa"" (he-IMPF NEG.PART drink tobacco) meaning ""He doesn't smoke.""
- **Paragraph 7** mentions that negation is generally marked by a clause-final negation particle, bo, which is not phonologically bound to the verb. However, it also notes that in some environments, such as negative imperatives, the particle changes form (bo to be), suggesting some phonological interaction.
- **Paragraph 21** explicitly states that Siamou (Seme) does not distinguish between perfective and imperfective negation strategies and uses a clause-final particle, bo, for both. This indicates that while the primary negation strategy involves a particle, there are instances where the verb form is affected by negation.

Given these points, it is clear that standard negation in Seme can involve modifications of the verb or the use of phonologically bound elements (auxiliaries or particles).

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Tima,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tima can be marked by both a proclitic and an enclitic that are phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative proclitic 'kV-' attaches to the beginning of the verb, and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ' attaches to the end of the verb or verb phrase. This is evident in several examples and descriptions throughout the paragraphs:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that Tima uses a negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and a negative enclitic marker '-Vŋ', both of which are external to the verb word but are phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples of negation in declarative clauses, showing the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ' attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 3 discusses the use of these negative markers in imperative, subjunctive, and veridical moods, further confirming their phonological binding to the verb.
- Paragraph 4 reiterates the use of 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' as the most common strategy for negation in Tima.
- Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 8 provide additional examples and descriptions of how these negative markers are used in different contexts, consistently showing their attachment to the verb.

Given this consistent evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Tima involves markers that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language !Xun (Ekoka). Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that ""verbal negation is fairly uniform across all dialects"" and that ""negation markers are pre-clitics (in case there is a verb)."" This indicates that the negation markers are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 18** states that verbs ""are negated by the proclitic *l6a."" This further confirms that the negation marker is a proclitic, which is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 14** provides an example where the negation marker (NEG) is placed between the subject and the verb, showing that it is indeed attached to the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in !Xun (Ekoka) can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Katcha,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Katcha can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs provide examples and descriptions of various verb forms and their extensions, including negation.

For instance, in Paragraph 26, the passive form of the verb is marked by the suffix ""-tené"" (e.g., ""kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́"" meaning ""the food is being cooked""). This indicates that Katcha uses suffixes to modify verbs for different grammatical purposes, including negation.

Additionally, Paragraph 29 discusses the antipassive form of the verb, which is marked by the suffix ""-ené"" (e.g., ""kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪ ́kɪ ́cé-éné"" meaning ""Kuku is laughing""). This further supports the use of suffixes to modify verbs in Katcha.

Given these examples, it is reasonable to conclude that Katcha can mark standard negation through affixes or modifications of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ijo (Kolokuma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Ijo (Kolokuma) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Sentences are made negative by the introduction of the marker -a between the last verb and the aspect marker,"" which clearly indicates the use of an affix for negation. Additionally, Paragraph 6 refers to the verb ""timi"" having an irregular present and negative form, further supporting the presence of verb modification for negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Emai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Affixation and Modification of the Verb**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that negative polarity in Emai consists of Perfect Negation (ì), Prospective Negation (khà), and Past Absolute Negation (yà). These negative markers precede the verb and are phonologically bound to it, indicating that negation is marked by an affix or a modification of the verb.
     - Example: ""ó ì è émàè"" (he NEG eat food) translates to ""He did not eat food.""
   - **Paragraph 10**: It further elaborates on the use of the negative marker ""ki"" for sentence negation, which precedes the verb and forms a phonological unit with it.
     - Example: ""kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì"" (SN the woman PAP.know-F) translates to ""Isn't it the case that the woman knew?""

2. **Phonological Boundaries**:
   - The negative markers (ì, khà, yà) and the sentence negation marker (ki) are phonologically bound to the verb, as indicated by their placement directly before the verb and their integration into the verb phrase without any intervening elements.

3. **Examples and Glosses**:
   - The provided examples in the paragraphs show the negative markers directly attached to the verb, confirming that they are affixes or modifications of the verb.

Given this information, it is clear that standard negation in Emai can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the method of standard negation in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that negation in Ik involves a combination of negating verbs and modal suffixes. Specifically, it lists the negating verbs such as ""ńt-"" for non-past realis and ""ma-/na-"" for past realis and other contexts. These negating verbs fill the syntactic slot for the main verb, and the negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood.

2. **Paragraph 6** further elaborates on the negating verbs, stating that they show agreement for an impersonal 3-person subject and take modal suffixes. The negating verbs are described as defective verbs rather than merely negating particles because they fill the clause-initial slot, take modal suffixes, and can be modified by tense enclitics.

3. **Paragraph 21** provides examples of negated sentences, showing the negating verbs ""ńt-"" and ""ma-/na-"" in use. For instance:
   - ""Nta ƙod."" (ńt-áƙó-dⁱ) translates to ""You don’t go.""
   - ""Maa naa ƙod."" (má-á=naaƙó-dⁱ) translates to ""You didn’t go (earlier today).""

4. **Paragraph 6** also mentions that the negating verbs can bear the dummy pronominal enclitic {=ˊdɛ}, which otherwise attaches only to verbs.

From these points, it is clear that standard negation in Ik involves the use of negating verbs that are phonologically bound to the verb they negate. These negating verbs act as prefixes or clitics that attach to the main verb, indicating that negation is marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ngiti,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ngiti can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 2 mentions that the negative marker ""inzi"" is used for the Imperative aspect and precedes the Imperative verb form.
- Paragraph 4 explains that negative markers ""inzi,"" ""inza,"" and ""imba"" can take different positions in the sentence and that ""inzi"" is used for the Imperfective aspect.
- Paragraph 11 states that ""inzi"" is the negative marker used with the Imperfective aspect, while ""inza"" correlates with the Perfective aspect.
- Paragraph 19 provides examples of negation with ""inzi"" preceding the verb, indicating that the negative marker is phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 26 shows that negative markers like ""inzi"" can be placed immediately following the conjugated verb or auxiliary verb, further supporting the idea that they are phonologically bound to the verb.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that standard negation in Ngiti involves markers that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as prefixes or clitics.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Sidaama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Negative Suffixes**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions the negative suffix **-kki** which is always attached to the verb of a subordinate clause. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix attached to the verb.
   - Paragraph 4 provides an example of the negative imperative suffix **-tooti** in the sentence ""hanni wajj-i-tooti"" (Do not be afraid), showing that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.

2. **Negative Proclitic**:
   - Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 23 discuss the negative proclitic **di=**, which attaches to the beginning of a clause-final constituent or a constituent in the focus position. This proclitic is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in examples like ""di=ha’-no"" (Let’s not go) and ""di=mar-t-ino"" (She did not go to the market).

3. **Examples of Negation with Clitics and Affixes**:
   - Paragraph 10 provides examples where the negative proclitic **di=** is used with verbs, such as ""di=e’-’-ino"" (The ball did not enter the house).
   - Paragraph 12 shows the use of the negative proclitic **di=** in sentences like ""di=bat-t’-anno=te"" (Lat’o is not the one who likes Dangura).

4. **Negative Imperative Suffixes**:
   - Paragraph 16 and Paragraph 26 discuss the use of negative imperative suffixes like **-nke** and **-tooti**, which are attached to verbs to indicate negation.

These points collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Sidaama can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mursi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mursi can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple instances where negation is marked directly on the verb through affixes or clitics.

2. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that verbs in the imperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó] and perfective verbs by the negative enclitic =ó attached to the verb root. This indicates the use of clitics for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of negative constructions using the circumclitic ŋà=…=ó for imperfective verbs and the enclitic =ó for perfective verbs. This further supports the use of clitics for marking negation.

- **Paragraph 11**: The table and examples illustrate the use of circumclitics for negating verbs in the imperfective aspect and the use of the negative enclitic =ó for perfective verbs. This shows that negation is marked directly on the verb.

- **Paragraph 16**: Discusses bound negators as circumclitics for imperfective verbs and enclitics for perfective verbs, reinforcing the use of clitics for negation.

- **Paragraph 13**: Mentions that copula verbs can be negated in the same way as regular verbs, using the negative circumclitic ŋà=…=ó, indicating that negation is marked on the verb.

- **Paragraph 6**: Provides examples of negative imperative constructions using the negative proclitic ŋà=, showing that negation is marked directly on the verb.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that standard negation in Mursi involves the use of affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Majang,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Majang can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in several paragraphs:

- Paragraph 3 mentions the use of a ""fully inflectable auxiliary k-"" for creating negative sentences, and the negative verbal nouns. The negative auxiliary takes the place of the verb in the clause, and the lexical negative verb form follows later as a complement to the auxiliary predication. This indicates that the negation involves a bound morpheme (the auxiliary k-).

- Paragraph 10 provides an example of the conjugation of the negative auxiliary, showing that it attaches to the verb and carries subject information, further supporting the presence of a bound morpheme for negation.

- Paragraph 12 discusses the necessity of the negative auxiliary k- preceding negative verb forms, indicating that the negative verb formation is based on the formation of infinitives and involves suffixes like -ɛːt and -iːt for negation.

- Paragraph 16 and 18 provide additional examples of the negative auxiliary with various inflections, reinforcing the use of bound morphemes for negation.

- Paragraph 26 gives an example of a negative verb form with the structure ""k-á óːl-ɛːL,"" where k- is the negative auxiliary and -ɛːL is a negative suffix.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Majang involves bound morphemes, either as prefixes (negative auxiliary k-) or suffixes (e.g., -ɛːt, -iːt) attached to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Birri,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Birri language, we can determine the method of standard negation as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions the use of negative particles ""ca — sa — sha"" at the end of negative statements. It provides examples like ""ini agbb-sa"" (they are not many) and ""akpa-sa"" (it is not good). These particles are not bound to the verb but are separate words placed at the end of the sentence.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the use of negative particles ""ca, sa, sha"" at the end of negative statements. It does not indicate that these particles are affixed to the verb or modify the verb directly.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of imperative negation using the negative particle ""sa"" at the end of the sentence, such as ""Do not steal o’o idi sa.""

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of negation with adjectives, showing the use of ""sha"" as a negative particle at the end of the sentence, such as ""akpa-sa"" (it is not good).

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides a comparative scheme of conjugation, showing the use of ""di-sa"" for negation in verbs, such as ""monyo di-sa"" (I did not eat). Here, ""di-sa"" appears to be a negative construction involving ""di"" and the particle ""sa.""

6. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph shows examples of negation with adjectives and verbs, using ""sha"" at the end of the sentence, such as ""ukama fre-sha"" (it is not big).

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the primary method of standard negation in Birri involves the use of negative particles ""ca, sa, sha"" placed at the end of the sentence. These particles are not affixed to the verb or modifying the verb directly but are separate words.

### Conclusion: 0

Standard negation in Birri cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The negation is marked by separate particles placed at the end of the sentence.",0,0
Tamashek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tamashek can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 2 describes the use of a special LoImpfN stem for negation, which is a negative variant of the LoImpfP. This indicates a modification of the verb stem to mark negation.
- Paragraph 4 mentions the Perfective Negative (PerfN) stem, which is used after the negative particle waer. The PerfN is formed by adding an ablaut formative to the verb, indicating a modification of the verb.
- Paragraph 9 further supports this by explaining that negation is expressed by the preverb waer, which undergoes Short-V Harmony to war when followed by a high vowel. This shows that the verb form changes in the presence of negation.
- Paragraph 11 elaborates on the effect of the negative particle waer on the verb form, describing specific phonological changes such as the replacement of vowels and the superimposition of melodies, which are clear indications of verb modification.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that negation in Tamashek involves modifications to the verb form, either through ablaut changes or the addition of specific negative markers that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Coptic,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Coptic can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that Coptic uses three morphologically distinct negation strategies, including the double negation ""wn ... an"" and the negative auxiliary verb ""TH 'to do not'"".
- **Paragraph 3** states that negative conjugations in Coptic are formed with negative affixes, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, and specialized negative tense-aspect markers.
- **Paragraph 5** describes the syntactically discontinuous negation ""N- ... an"" involving a negative prefix ""n-"" and a clause-internal negation adverb ""an 'not'"".
- **Paragraph 9** indicates that all negative tenses are marked by a morpheme-initial labial or velar nasal ""w-"" or ""N-"", which merges negation with the relevant tense-aspect-mood marker into a single morph.
- **Paragraph 10** further supports this by showing examples of negative tenses marked by ""N-"" or ""n-"".
- **Paragraph 24** provides examples of negative conjugations where negation is marked directly on the verb, such as ""N-q-CWTM AN"" for ""he is not hearing"".

These points collectively demonstrate that Coptic employs affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Igbo can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that negation in Igbo can be marked by inherently negative lexical verbs, inherently negative auxiliary verbs, and negative inflectional suffixes. Examples provided include:
   - ""O chefùrù ime ya"" (He did not remember/forgot to do it) where the verb ""chefùrù"" includes a negative inflectional suffix.
   - ""O chèzòrò ime ya"" (He forgot to do it) where the verb ""chèzòrò"" also includes a negative inflectional suffix.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that the general negative suffix =ghI is used in Igbo to mark negation. It states:
   - ""The negative counterpart of these are realized by the affixation of the general negative suffix =ghI, to the auxiliary verb, or main verb, as the case may be, with the attendant tonal patterns determined by the verb form.""

3. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph reinforces that the appropriate negative marker is suffixed to the verb in predicate negation. It states:
   - ""Ndimele is correct that in predicate negation, the appropriate negative marker is suffixed to the verb.""

4. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of the negative infinitive form, which includes the harmonizing general negative suffix =ghi:
   - ""é-rī-ghi"" (not eating)
   - ""a-zà-ghì"" (not sweeping)

5. **Paragraph 21**: This paragraph discusses the presence of the harmonizing general negative marker =ghi and the harmonizing negative prefix A- in negative forms:
   - ""In the (b) cases of the negative forms we will find the harmonizing general negative marker =ghi immediately following the past tense marker in 20(b) or the auxiliaries in the future, 21(b) or Future-in-the Past, 22(b), forms.""

These paragraphs collectively provide clear evidence that standard negation in Igbo can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb. The use of negative suffixes like =ghI and inherently negative inflectional suffixes directly attached to the verb root or auxiliary verb confirms this.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mambai,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph describes negative subject pronouns that exhibit specific tonal values (LH for negative Perfective and HL for negative non-Perfective forms). This indicates a modification of the verb through tonal changes.
  
- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions the use of negation particles yá and gá with verbs. The particle yá is used with Indicative verb forms and is described as a clitic that takes the nasal value of the last syllable of the preceding morpheme, indicating that it is phonologically bound to the verb.

- **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the use of the negative particle yá, which is found clause-finally and is accompanied by a modification of the structure of subject pronouns, marking realis value. This further supports the idea of phonological binding and modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph summarizes that negative verb forms are marked with negation particles and negative subject pronouns, reinforcing the information from previous paragraphs.

- **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of negative Perfective and non-Perfective pronouns, showing the use of specific pronouns (e.g., mìí for 1SG:PFV.NEG) and the particle yá, indicating phonological binding and modification.

- **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph confirms the use of negative non-Perfective pronouns and the particle yá, showing that negation is marked on the verb through these elements.

Given the consistent evidence across multiple paragraphs that negation involves phonologically bound elements (clitics) and modifications of the verb (through tonal changes and specific pronouns), it is clear that standard negation in Mambai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Ingessana,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Ingessana (Gaahmg) is marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here are the relevant points:

Gorowa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Gorowa can be marked by an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The evidence is found in Paragraph 1, which describes the use of the negative clitic =ká(ng) that attaches to verb roots extended by the suffix -a in the present tense and -i in the past tense. This clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation.

For example:
- In the present tense: ""tam motloo ngi xu’aká"" (She doesn’t even know tomorrow)
- In the past tense: ""inós tunáy ngu xu’iká"" (She didn’t know of dried honey)

These examples show that the clitic =ká(ng) attaches directly to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by a phonologically bound element.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Shatt,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Shatt can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate the presence of suffixes and other morphemes that attach to verbs, which are used to modify their meaning. For example, paragraph 6 mentions the identifying suffix –ang on the verb ""kawungang"" (came), and paragraph 22 discusses the identity suffix –ang attaching to the last word of dependent clauses, which includes verbs. These examples demonstrate that Shatt uses suffixes that are phonologically bound to verbs, thereby modifying them to convey different grammatical meanings, including negation.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Koromfe,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that negation can be achieved using negative subject pronouns, which are proclitics on the verb. This indicates that these negative pronouns are phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 6 further supports this by stating that negative personal pronouns always shorten the long final ""aa"" of a following progressive verb form, indicating a phonological interaction between the negation marker and the verb.
- Paragraph 29 confirms the presence of preverbal negative particles and negative pronouns that intervene between the subject and the verb, showing that negation is marked in a way that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Koromfe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nobiin,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nobiin can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions the element ""-min/-muun-"" inserted between the verbal base and ending, which indicates a bound morpheme used for negation. Additionally, Paragraph 5 describes the use of the verb ""men-/min-"" for negation in periphrastic constructions, further supporting the presence of bound morphemes in negation. These examples clearly show that negation in Nobiin involves phonologically bound elements attached to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- **Paragraph 2:** Describes the negative present paradigm with the element ""-min/-muun-"" inserted between the verbal base and ending, indicating a bound morpheme used for negation.
- **Paragraph 5:** Discusses the use of ""men-/min-"" in periphrastic constructions for negation, showing that negation involves bound morphemes attached to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Nyimang. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""In the 3rd Person, ~ replaces ~ only:in the negative of' sentences vihich use ka and ~ togetl1er. (p.112)ill. a torEe 11a8n' t comefa a SOl'':C:l1.e;; have not come (or En iQ SOl')(or en ;ha tor)~ ataiHe has not gonef~ atelaiThey he.ve got~Qne(or en~ tai) (0:;:'en ~ tslai)en a f9. tai? byrer, fe. a tai~Iasn' ten kVI8.U a gEr.an't he come from the cro:)s?

3. **Paragraph 39**:
   - ""Don't you want it?

From these paragraphs, we can observe the following:

- **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of ""fa"" in negative sentences.
- **Paragraph 10** provides examples where ""fa"" precedes the verb to indicate negation, such as ""fa wo"" (do not know) and ""fa kil"" (does not understand).
- **Paragraph 39** also shows ""fa"" used before verbs to indicate negation, such as ""fa WEna"" (I don't want it), ""fa tai"" (I am not going), and ""fa n;;on"" (She is not carrying a basket).

The consistent use of ""fa"" directly preceding the verb indicates that negation in Nyimang can be marked by a modification of the verb through the addition of a negative particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning**:
- The negative particle ""fa"" is consistently used before verbs to indicate negation.
- This particle forms a phonological unit with the verb, as it directly precedes and modifies the verb to convey negation.

**Conclusion**: 1",0,1
Lamé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Lamé is marked by particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb. The negative markers ""tsú"" and ""mì"" are used to negate the clause, but they do not attach to the verb or modify it directly. Instead, ""tsú"" appears immediately after the subject noun or pronoun, and ""mì"" appears at the end of the clause. These markers are separate words and do not form a phonological unit with the verb.

For example:
- ""Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə bə̀kà mì"" (Tau didn’t go to the market this morning)
- ""tá tsú gí tsoɓ mbìr mì"" (she does not sell milk)

In these examples, the negation is achieved through the use of the particles ""tsú"" and ""mì"", which are not bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Bininj Gun-Wok,"Conclusion: 1

Reasoning:
Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Bininj Gun-Wok uses affixes and clitics to mark negation in verbs. Specifically, the negative particles such as ""marrek"" and ""bayun"" are used in combination with verb forms to express negation. Additionally, the language employs negative imperative particles like ""bayun"" (Dj), ""yu(wu)n"" (W, I), and ""marrek"" (E) to form negative commands. These particles are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by affixes or clitics attached to the verb. Therefore, it is clear that Bininj Gun-Wok can mark standard negation through affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.",0,1
Wambaya,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Wambaya is marked using particles such as ""guyala"" and ""yangula."" These particles are not affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they appear to function as separate words that precede the verb or auxiliary in the clause. For instance, in Paragraph 5, it is mentioned that ""the constructions are primarily distinguished by the form of the negative particle — yangula or guyala — which appears in initial position in the clause."" Additionally, Paragraph 16 provides an example where ""Yangula irr-agba jiyawu"" translates to ""They will not give it to him,"" indicating that ""yangula"" is a separate particle used for negation.

There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that negation in Wambaya involves affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself. The negation is consistently described as being achieved through the use of independent negative particles.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Wardaman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, it is clear that standard negation in Wardaman is marked by particles rather than by affixes or clitics bound to the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3**:
   - These paragraphs describe the use of negative particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" to negate verbs. The particles are not affixed to the verb but occur as separate words preceding the verb or other elements in the clause.
   - Example from Paragraph 3: ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" are described as clausal negators that generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb or before a particle plus finite verb combination.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of negation using the particles ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" in various contexts, including with verbs and nominal phrases. The particles are not bound to the verbs but are separate elements.
   - Example: ""wonggo neg nu-bu-n"" (you are not killing it) shows ""wonggo"" as a separate particle preceding the verb.

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph discusses the formation of negative imperatives using the particle ""wonggo"" with finite verbs. Again, the particle is not bound to the verb but occurs separately.
   - Example: ""wonggo duba yi-ni-jingi-n"" (Don't sit down!) shows ""wonggo"" as a separate particle.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - This paragraph mentions the use of ""ngawun"" as an interjection meaning 'no, nothing' and its use as a complement to the negators ""wonggo"" and ""warna"". This further supports the use of separate particles for negation.

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - This paragraph reiterates the use of ""wonggo"" and ""warna"" as particles that negate noun phrases and other elements, not bound to verbs.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Wardaman is achieved through the use of separate negative particles rather than affixes or clitics bound to the verb. Therefore, the correct response is:

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Gooniyandi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Gooniyandi is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, negation is achieved through the use of separate particles such as ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami,"" which are not phonologically bound to the verb. These particles function independently and are not affixed or cliticized to the verb forms.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, the negation is marked by the particle ""mangaddi"" in the sentence ""mangaddi nganyi mar/ami ngoodtkxJ -yarndi,"" where ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami"" are used as separate words to indicate negation. Similarly, in Paragraph 4, ""mangaddi"" is described as a negative particle that modifies the proposition, not the verb itself.

Additionally, Paragraph 3 discusses the use of ""mangaddi"" and ""mar/ami"" in various contexts, but there is no indication that these particles are bound to the verb. They are used independently to negate the clause.

Therefore, based on the provided information, standard negation in Gooniyandi is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Tiwi,"1. Based on the paragraphs provided, it is evident that standard negation in Tiwi can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. 

Reasoning:
- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative particle ""kalu"" (or ""karluwu"") for standard negation in Tiwi. It states that this particle is inserted in the verbal complex, and there is no subjunctive or irrealis prefix on the verb in these cases. This implies that the negation is marked by a particle that is phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 3 provides examples of the irrealis prefix ""karluwu"" used in negative constructions, which is bound to the verb. For instance, ""karluwu awungani yi-rri-mi"" (he wasn't like that) and ""karluwu ngarra jihe-f- kuruwala"" (he didn't sing).
- Paragraph 6 further supports this by showing examples where the negative particle ""kalu"" is used in conjunction with verbs, indicating that the negation is marked within the verbal complex.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Tiwi involves elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, either through particles or prefixes.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nakkara,"1. The paragraphs provided contain sufficient information to determine that standard negation in Nakkara can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the following points are relevant:

- Paragraph 4 mentions that the prefix ""ka-"" occurs with negative verb constructions in Contemporary and Future tenses.
- Paragraph 6 describes the negative particle ""korla"" which precedes the verb form, and the verb form can be an irrealis or irrealis negative form.
- Paragraph 11 explains that the negative affix ""-ma"" is used in the tense slot of the verb complex for PC/T negative constructions.
- Paragraph 21 provides an example of a negative construction where ""korla"" precedes the verb and the verb has the negative affix ""-ma"".
- Paragraph 49 confirms that the irrealis component ""-ma"" occurs in the tense slot of PC/T negative constructions.

These points indicate that negation in Nakkara involves both a negative particle ""korla"" and a negative affix ""-ma"" attached to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Garrwa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Garrwa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 4** (9.5.1 Negation): This paragraph explicitly states that the negative particle ""miku"" is used in initial position for clausal negation. It is followed by second-position clitic elements, which can include pronouns or modal clitics. The verb usually follows this clitic complex directly. For instance, in negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form with the suffix ""-kanyi"" (e.g., ""miku ngayu jilaj-kanyi"" meaning ""I’m not going""). This indicates that negation involves a modification of the verb form.
  
- **Paragraph 6** (Other sentence types): This paragraph provides examples of negated clauses where the verb is modified by the irrealis suffix ""-kanyi"" in the presence of the negative particle ""miku"" (e.g., ""miku-ya dukuj-kanyi, jilijba-wa"" meaning ""It’s not dry (yet), it’s still wet""). This further supports the use of verb modification in negation.

- **Paragraph 5** (Clitics): This paragraph shows examples of the negative particle ""miku"" combined with clitics (e.g., ""miku=kiya"" meaning ""neg=oblig"" and ""miku=wali"" meaning ""neg=evid""). These examples illustrate that negation can be marked by clitics that attach to the negative particle.

- **Paragraph 14** (Structure of the Garrwa clausal core): This paragraph confirms that the negative particle ""miku"" can occupy the initial position in the clausal core, followed by clitics and then the verb, which may be modified.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that standard negation in Garrwa involves the use of a negative particle ""miku"" that can be followed by clitics and that the verb can be modified (e.g., by the irrealis suffix ""-kanyi"").

Ngankikurungkurr,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the particle ""minbe/minde"" used in a privative sense, but it does not provide clear evidence of it being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** describes the verb ""yityi-'do'"" being modified by the negative particle ""minbe,"" indicating that ""minbe"" functions as a negative particle. However, it does not specify whether ""minbe"" is phonologically bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 3** includes examples where ""minbe"" is used in negative constructions, such as ""minbe yarra-gi"" (Neg 2plPokeDtr-Mp-side-Val-place) and ""minbe pulpulmuy yi"" (Neg 2sgSit-Isg), but again, it does not clarify if ""minbe"" is phonologically bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of ""minbe"" suffixed with generics, such as ""minbe-yenggi"" (Neg-fire) and ""minbe-yawurr"" (Neg-tree), suggesting that ""minbe"" can attach to other elements, but it does not confirm attachment to verbs specifically.

5. **Paragraph 16** mentions that particles like ""minbe/minde"" can attract verbal enclitics such as the temporal focus marker ""-nyine/-kana(K)"" and tense markers ""-tye"" and ""-pe/-ngini(K),"" indicating that ""minbe"" can be part of a phonological unit with the verb.

6. **Paragraph 17** discusses enclitics and their scope over clausal propositions, but it does not provide specific examples of ""minbe"" being phonologically bound to verbs.

From these points, it is evident that ""minbe"" functions as a negative particle and can attract verbal enclitics, forming a phonological unit with the verb. This suggests that standard negation in Ngankikurungkurr can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we need to determine if standard negation in Wagiman can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2 (10.1.1)**:
   - The adverb **dyamba** is used to express negation in various contexts such as inability, lack of desire, and negative commands. It is glossed as 'Irrealis negative' (IRR NEG).
   - Examples:
     - **dyamba** IRR NEG gu-ya'-dya 3sg:POT-tell-IMM
     - **dyamba** IRR NEG gi-yaXIagid~a 2sg:IPFV-go mess around
     - **dyamba** IRR NEG nilya, nyolqa qa-yu, no sick wil'ma

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Negative imperative participles are expressed by attaching the nominal Privative suffix **-ne'en** to the unmarked stem of the participle.
   - Example:
     - **gatkata-ne'en** laugh-PRIV 'Don't laugh!'

3. **Paragraph 36 (10.1.2)**:
   - The adverb **wudyi** is used as a sentential negator, typically occurring in clause-initial position.
   - Examples:
     - **wudyi** ga-ya'ganq-maga'an lagiban NEG 3sg:IPFV-tell lsg OBL-FOC that mang-~a-ggi 3sg:PFV-go-PAST
     - **wudyi** ga-nanda-yiga'an lagiban daty NEG lsg-see-PAST that man belt-PCT 3sg/lsg-hit-PPCT

### Analysis:

- **dyamba** functions as an irrealis negative marker and is used in various contexts to negate the verb. It appears to be a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.
- The **Privative suffix -ne'en** is attached to participles to form negative imperatives, indicating that negation can be marked by a suffix.
- **wudyi** is used as a sentential negator and appears to be a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.

### Conclusion:

The evidence shows that negation in Wagiman can be marked by a suffix (Privative suffix **-ne'en**), which attaches to the verb. This fits the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",0,1
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), it is evident that standard negation in this language can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 2 explicitly describes the use of the particle ""i-"" combined with the negator la to form negative constructions. Examples include ""le-y-pal6†"" and ""l5-pal6†,"" where the negation is marked by a prefix attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 also mentions the contraction of the sequence /lay/ to /ley/ or /l5/, indicating a phonological binding of the negator to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 provides examples from the text corpus, such as ""le-y-máxi"" and ""l5-xàru,"" where the negation is clearly marked by a modification of the verb through the addition of a prefix.
- Paragraph 2 further describes the use of the negative copula formed by combining la with the copula series, resulting in forms like ""l7le,"" ""l7la,"" and ""l7l5,"" which are used to negate present copula constructions. This demonstrates the use of affixation to mark negation.

Given these examples and descriptions, it is clear that Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) employs affixes and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
English,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in English can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 43 discusses the use of ""won't"" as a synthetic form of ""will not,"" indicating that negation can be marked inflectionally on the verb. Additionally, Paragraph 44 mentions that negation can be marked analytically by adding ""not"" after the verb or synthetically by using negative forms like ""isn't"" or ""doesn't."" These examples demonstrate that English employs both analytic and synthetic methods for marking negation, with the synthetic forms being phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Korean,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Korean uses both affixes and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation. The evidence includes:

- Paragraph 6 mentions the structure ""-ci anh-"" which is a long form of negation that can be used with verbs and adjectives. This structure involves the suffix ""-ci"" followed by the negative auxiliary ""anh-"".
- Paragraph 11 describes the short negative ""an"" and the long negative ""mos"" which can be used to negate verbs.
- Paragraph 15 provides examples of the verb ""iss-"" (to be) and its negative forms ""anh-"" and ""mos-"", showing that these negatives can be attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 16 discusses the use of ""anh-"" and ""mos-"" in negative constructions, indicating that these are bound forms that attach to the verb.
- Paragraph 28 explains negative preemphasis, where particles like ""ul/lul"" or ""i/ka"" can be inserted after the suspective ""-ci"" to emphasize the negation, further showing the bound nature of these negative markers.

These examples demonstrate that Korean uses both affixes and modifications of the verb to mark standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Basque,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Basque involves the use of the negative particle ""ez,"" which is phonologically bound to the auxiliary verb. This is evident from multiple examples where ""ez"" directly precedes the auxiliary verb, forming a phonological unit with it. For instance, in Paragraph 1, we see ""ez da"" (not AUX), and in Paragraph 2, ""ez du"" (not AUX). Additionally, Paragraph 6 mentions the construction ""ez irakurri"" (not read), where ""ez"" is directly attached to the verb form. This pattern is consistent across various examples, indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Malayalam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there are several indications that standard negation in Malayalam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Paragraph 14**: ""Future negative is formed by the addition of ©§y to the verb stem.""
   - This indicates that the negative marker ©§y is added directly to the verb stem, suggesting an affixation process.

2. **Paragraph 30**: ""Negative is formed by the addition of ie§y after the tense marker. When it is added the final -§ of -S0™ becomes zero.""
   - This further supports the idea that negation involves adding a specific morpheme (ie§y) to the verb, which modifies the verb form.

3. **Paragraph 36**: ""the suffix -§•» added to the verb form and - ^ to any other word in the sentence indicates some sort of emphasis and restriction.""
   - This suggests that the suffix -§•» can be added to the verb form, indicating a bound morpheme used for negation.

4. **Paragraph 43**: ""negative imperatives, etc., can be obtained by using the negative verbal participle followed by the respective form of 'to be' verb.""
   - This implies that negation can be marked on the verb through the use of negative participles.

5. **Paragraph 48**: ""Negative verbal participles are introduced. These are formed by adding -<5ra«w to the verb stem.""
   - This clearly indicates that a negative participle is formed by adding a specific suffix (-<5ra«w) to the verb stem.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Malayalam can indeed be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the standard negation in Mien is marked by the negative particle ""maiv"" or its contracted form ""mv,"" which is placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs. There is no evidence in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. The negative particle ""maiv"" or ""mv"" functions as a separate word that precedes the verb, rather than attaching to it or modifying it.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 5**: ""Negation is marked by the particle maiv /mai˦˥˧/ ‘not’, placed immediately before verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs. In rapid and colloquial speech, the particle is often contracted to a syllabic nasal mv /m̩ ˦˥˧/.""
2. **Paragraph 7**: ""Negation in Iu Mien is marked by the negative particle maiv / mai˦˥˧/ or its contraction form (i.e. syllabic nasal) mv /m̩ ˦˥˧/ ‘not’ placed immediately before the verbals (i.e. verbs, copular verbs, modal verbs, and adjectival verbs).""
3. **Paragraph 22**: ""Verbs (and adjectival verbs) can 1) immediately be preceded by the negative particle maiv (or mv)...""
4. **Paragraph 31**: ""The compounds can be preceded by the negative particle maiv but they cannot be separated by inserting it.""

These points indicate that the negation particle ""maiv"" or ""mv"" is a separate word that precedes the verb and is not phonologically bound to it as an affix or clitic would be.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation particle ""maiv"" or ""mv"" is consistently described as preceding the verb rather than attaching to it.
- There is no mention of the negation being marked by a modification of the verb or by an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Semelai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions the imperative negator ""boy"" followed by the verb, which forms the negative imperative of intransitive verbs. This indicates that ""boy"" is a pre-verbal negator, suggesting a form of bound negation.
   
2. **Paragraph 15** further elaborates that the imperative negator ""boy"" can stand alone if the verb is elided but usually hosts either =ca? 'IMPI' or =jia 'IMP2', or is followed by ""na? yandeh 'IMP3'"". This indicates that the negator can be cliticized, forming a phonological unit with the verb.

3. **Paragraph 17** describes the use of the irrealis proclitic ""ma="" in forming negative imperatives of transitive clauses, which is another instance of bound negation.

4. **Paragraph 33** confirms that the clitic ""ma="" is used to form the familiar form of the negative imperative of active transitive verbs, further supporting the presence of bound negation.

5. **Paragraph 47** states that the proclitic ""ma="" cliticizes to the initial verbal constituent of the verbal word, as seen in the negative imperative clause example ""boy ma=y:>k!"" (Don't fetch (it)!), indicating that the negation is marked by a bound morpheme.

Given these points, it is clear that Semelai employs bound morphemes (affixes or clitics) for marking standard negation in dynamic verbal predicates.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yukaghir (Kolyma) can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 32 states that ""the standard sentential negation is expressed by attaching the prefix el+ to the finite verb."" This indicates that the negative marker is an affix that attaches directly to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Georgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Georgian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs describe the use of the negative particle ""ar"" and its interaction with verb forms, including the Perfect tense, which switches to the Perfect when negated by ""ar"". This indicates that negation can be marked by modifying the verb form. Additionally, the use of ""nu"" for prohibitions and ""ver"" for potential negation also suggests that these particles interact closely with the verb forms, further supporting the conclusion that negation can be marked by modifications or affixes/clitics bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Alutor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Alutor by examining the specific forms and markers used to express negation. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several methods of verbal negation, including:
   - Combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb.
   - Combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative.
   - Analytical forms derived from the deverbal predicative.
   - Circumfixes (e.g., tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in).

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of negative forms:
   - Example (13a): ""Hatav gym-nan ally a-la@u-ka"" (Only I didn't see (them)).
   - Example (13b): ""kytvyl gytty a-wintat-ka"" (Don't you dare help saw the tusks).

3. **Paragraph 4** mentions the use of circumfixes for negation:
   - Example (16a): ""kytvyl nuNy-nm-amyny-nty-nat"" (Let's not go to look for them).

4. **Paragraph 5** discusses the analytical forms with negative polarity:
   - The lexical verb inside positive analytical forms has the suffix marker -a/-ta.
   - Negative polarity is marked by adding the nuN- prefix.

5. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of negative analytical forms:
   - Example (30): ""...ally nota-pilg.at-kail-la-tkyni-tyk"" (will not be (left) hungry).

6. **Paragraph 7** mentions the use of the negative particle ally in combination with other markers:
   - Example (6a): ""allyaNylJg.at-ka, allya-tirN.at-ka"" (I don't moan. I don't cry).

From these points, it is evident that Alutor uses various methods to mark negation, including:
- **Circumfixes**: e.g., tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in.
- **Prefixes**: e.g., nuN-.
- **Negative particles**: e.g., ally, which can be combined with other markers.

These markers are phonologically bound to the verb, either as circumfixes or prefixes, indicating that negation is integrated into the verb morphology.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Thai is marked by placing a negative word in front of the verb or, in certain cases, after it. This is evident from the following excerpts:

1. **Paragraph 2**: ""A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of the verb or, in certain cases, after it.""
2. **Paragraph 3**: ""Another common way of rendering 'Yes' or 'No' in answering a question is merely to repeat the verb on its own for the affirmative or the verb preceded by the negative word MY for the negative.""
3. **Paragraph 12**: ""When DY is used with the negative word MY the meaning is again dependent on the position with relation to the verb. MY DY placed in front of the verb means 'did not' and this construction is very widely used.""

These descriptions indicate that the negative marker ""MY"" (or ""MY DY"" for past tense negation) is a separate word that precedes the verb. There is no indication that the negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, the negation is achieved through the use of a separate particle that is not phonologically bound to the verb.

Therefore, based on the provided information, standard negation in Thai cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Nganasan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nganasan can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. The paragraphs describe the use of a negative auxiliary (ńisɨ) that is inflected for tense, mood, and agreement with the subject, and the main verb appears in its connegative form. This indicates that the negative auxiliary forms a phonological unit with the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of suffixes in expressing negation, specifically ""-ʁavr-ləyə-yzu-ger-NEG"" and ""NEG.EXP, NEG.HAB,"" indicating that negation can be marked by suffixes attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 3 discusses the ""negational suffix"" and provides an example of a negational suffix ""-en"" that is used in combination with the honorific suffix ""-mas-,"" further supporting the presence of negational suffixes.
- Paragraph 4 lists various negational markers such as ""-ʁavr-,"" ""-ləyə-,"" and ""-yzu-,"" which are used in verb forms, indicating that negation is marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Nivkh can be marked by affixes or modifications directly on the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Jarawa (in Andamans),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Jarawa can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of the negative particle ""naɖem"" and the suffix ""-ma"" for negation. Specifically, it shows that the suffix ""-ma"" can be used instead of ""naɖem"" to negate a verb.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that negation in Jarawa can be expressed either by using the independent negative word ""naɖem"" or the suffix ""-ma"". It also notes that the suffix ""-ma"" has restricted use, while ""naɖem"" can be used more broadly.

3. **Paragraph 3** provides further evidence by stating that Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: using a negative word at the end of a clause or a negative suffix on the verbs. It explicitly mentions that the negative suffix is used only in verbal clauses.

4. **Paragraph 6** demonstrates the use of the negative suffix ""-ma"" in prohibitives, providing an example sentence where the verb ""ɖəbəᵼʈʰe"" (go) is negated by the suffix ""-ma"".

5. **Paragraph 16** discusses the use of the suffix ""-ma"" on the verbal predicate for negation. It also mentions that when the suffix ""-ma"" is used, no other suffix (like modality suffixes) can be attached to the verb, indicating that ""-ma"" replaces other suffixal markings.

6. **Paragraph 21** outlines the structure of verbs with affixes in Jarawa, including the negative marker (NEG) as a suffix category.

7. **Paragraph 29** confirms that the negative particle or suffix appears at the end of the clause, further supporting the use of suffixes for negation.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Jarawa uses the suffix ""-ma"" to mark negation on verbs, which qualifies as an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nahali,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nahali, it is clear that standard negation in Nahali can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1**: The negation marker ""ho:to"" can precede or follow the verb, as in ""ho:to-kappo"" ('does not/did not sleep'). This indicates that ""ho:to"" is phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that the negative markers ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:ṭo"" can occur before or after the verb. Specifically, ""beṭhe"" can precede the verb and undergo assimilation, as in ""beṭhe pa:ṭo"" ('does not come') becoming ""bep-pa:ṭo"". This shows that ""beṭhe"" is phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of negative constructions where ""beṭhe"" and ""ho:to"" are used as affixes or clitics attached to the verb, such as ""jo beṭhe kappoka"" ('I do not sleep') and ""jo ho:to kappo"" ('I did not sleep').

These examples demonstrate that negation in Nahali involves affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kusunda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Kusunda can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that negative realis-assertion is marked by a suffix -aÚu in Class II verbs. This clearly indicates that negation is marked by an affix attached to the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 3**: Provides examples of negative realis in both Class I and Class II verbs. For Class I verbs, the suffix -daÚu is used, and for Class II verbs, the suffixes -d-aÚu, -n-aÚu, and -g-aÚu are used for first, second, and third persons respectively. These are all affixes attached to the verb to indicate negation.
  
- **Paragraph 7**: Discusses mutating verbs and mentions that negative realis employs mutation as part of its marking strategy, with the negative suffix -u added to the mutated root. This indicates a modification of the verb for negation.
  
- **Paragraph 9**: Mentions that negative irrealis-assertion is marked by a suffix -wa, which can be contracted to -u. This again shows that negation is marked by an affix attached to the verb.

These paragraphs collectively provide clear evidence that standard negation in Kusunda can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Udihe,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Udihe can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, paragraph 4 states that negation is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-, which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms. This indicates that the negative auxiliary verb is phonologically bound to the content verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

Additionally, paragraph 14 mentions that the negative conjugation is periphrastic and involves the negative auxiliary verb e(i)- in the corresponding temporal/aspectual/modal form followed by a bare Present stem of the matrix verb. This further supports the conclusion that negation involves a bound morpheme (the negative auxiliary verb) that attaches to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ingush,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingush can be marked by both suffixes and proclitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. The evidence is as follows:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that the negative morpheme can be a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's inflectional form. Specifically, it states that the suffix is used for tense forms, while proclitic particles are used for converbs, nonfinites, and imperatives.
- Paragraph 7 provides detailed examples of suffixal negation for indicative finite verbs, showing the suffixes -(â)c and -(â)ndz- used to mark negation.
- Paragraph 13 further confirms the use of negative proclitics (cy= for nonfinite forms and my= for imperatives) and suffixes (-ac, -andz-ar) for marking negation.
- Paragraph 6 reiterates that negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush, with specific examples of negative forms.

Given this consistent evidence across multiple paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ingush involves affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Lezgian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, it is clear that standard negation can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -δ and the negative prefix tA- are used to negate verbs in Lezgian. This is evident from the following excerpts:

- Paragraph 1: ""As has been noted in 9.3.5., verbs are negated by the negative suffix -δ or by the negative prefix tA-. Such verbal negation is the normal sentence negation in Lezgian, e.g. ... qaöu-zwa-δ 'take-IMPF-NEG' ...""

- Paragraph 3: ""Finite indicative verb forms are negated by means of the suffix -δ (e.g. guzwa 'gives', guzwa-δ 'does not give'). Non-finite and non-indicative verb forms are negated by prefixal negation. ...""

These examples demonstrate that negation in Lezgian can be marked directly on the verb through affixation or prefixation, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Galo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Galo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide multiple instances where the negative suffix -máa is used to mark negation directly on the verb.

For example:
- Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Final predicates in negative polarity are obligatorily suffixed in -máa.""
- Paragraph 3 provides an example: ""ŋók jôo azә́ә kaamá, rɨdakkôm rɨmaakôm,"" where kaamá is the verb 'have/exist' with the negative suffix -máa.
- Paragraph 8 also discusses the use of -máa in negative constructions: ""nó jôocin momà!"" where momà is the verb 'make' with the negative suffix -máa.

These examples clearly show that negation is marked by an affix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation in Galo.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly mention the use of suffixes to indicate negation directly on the verb. For example:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the suffix ""-nguq"" in ""tekite-ksail-nguq=wa"" and ""tekite-ksait-uq"" to mark negation.
- Paragraph 3 lists various negative suffixes such as |-nћլit-| ‘not’, |-ksait-| ‘not yet’, and others that attach to verbs to indicate negation.
- Paragraph 4 provides an example of the future suffix occurring immediately before the negative suffix |-nћլit-| to indicate stronger negation: ""ayag-ciqe-nrit-ua"" (‘I will not go’).
- Paragraph 5 discusses the use of negative suffixes in appositional moods, such as |-1na-| and |-1naku|, which are used to form negative appositional verbs.
- Paragraph 21 and 22 further illustrate the use of negative suffixes like |-nrit-| and |-ksait-| in various contexts.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) is indeed marked by affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Yuki,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuki can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The primary method for negation in Yuki is the suffixation of the negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb, as seen in multiple examples provided in the paragraphs. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

Examples:
- Paragraph 1: ""The primary method for negation in Yuki is the negation of the verb by the suffixation of a negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb.""
- Paragraph 1: ""The verbs in both clauses contain the same morphology, except for the presence of negative -ṭan in (60).""
- Paragraph 1: ""Once again the only difference is that the verb in the negative clause (62) contains the negative suffix -ṭan, while the verb in the affirmative clause (63) does not.""

These examples clearly show that the negative morpheme -ṭan is an affix that attaches to the verb to mark negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Pipil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, it is evident that standard negation in Pipil can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 2 (4.5.2. Negative imperatives) provides examples of negative imperatives formed with ""te:"" or ""ma:/maka"" plus the ""xi-"" imperative prefix. This indicates that negation involves a prefix that attaches to the verb, as seen in examples like ""ma: xi-nech-mikti"" (don't kill me) and ""te: xi-k-kwa-kan"" (don't eat it).

- Paragraph 3 (4.1. Word order) mentions that verbs bear pronominal affixes which cross-reference subjects and objects. This implies that verbs in Pipil can take various affixes, including those for negation.

- Paragraph 6 (3.7. Verbs) describes the order of verbal affixes, including tense, aspect, and pronominal affixes. This suggests that negation could also be marked through affixation on the verb.

- Paragraph 16 (3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object') and Paragraph 36 (3.7.4.1. 'Reflexive' (mu-)) describe the use of prefixes like ""ta-"" and ""mu-"" with verbs, further supporting the idea that verbs in Pipil can take various prefixes, including those for negation.

These points collectively indicate that negation in Pipil can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Micmac,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that standard negation in Micmac can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions that the negative morpheme intervenes between the ""Stem"" and ""Ending"" nodes, indicating that the negation is integrated into the verb structure. Paragraph 7 further supports this by describing the presence of a negative morpheme in the verb forms. Paragraph 47 provides explicit examples of negative forms of the verb ""welagapi-"" where the negative morpheme ""-w-"" is inserted within the verb complex, following the dual or plural number morpheme and preceding the person markers.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence for this conclusion is found in several examples where the negative particle ""jaantu"" or its truncated form ""tuu"" is used in combination with clitics that attach to the verb or other elements within the clause.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, the clitic +ka7 attaches to ""jaantu"" to form ""jaantuka7"" (NEG+JST), indicating that the negation is phonologically bound to the verb. Similarly, in Paragraph 3, the negative particle ""jaantu"" precedes the verb and can be combined with other clitics, as seen in examples like ""jaantu+ch"" (NEG+ALD) and ""jaantu+7as"" (NEG+TAGQ) in Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 7. These examples demonstrate that negation in Tepehua (Huehuetla) involves affixation or cliticization that is phonologically bound to the verb or other elements in the clause.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is evidence suggesting that standard negation in Musqueam can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 18 provides examples of negative forms that involve modifications to the verb:

> ""When a passive or sk*”éy the end with -Tk?“osofthetold'wasn'ttold’‘youfolksweren'tis thefirstverb(‘impossible’ passivewithtold'-1ortold' after'can't')objectpronoun,with-sTa negativeadd £>3t}toThus:-0213m-3t-1213m-3t-s0213m-3t~eam-3t-1aem-3t-seam-3t‘you(one person)!-tdm-3t-13m-3¢-stdm-3t""the,she,-taldm-3¢49 -181%m-3t= -st&1ldm-3t= ""youfolks!(-4ix""es -3tisn't a true passive is not added)‘Ttsoit,they'‘wetExamples:sk>“éy kosméyetl3m3tsk?”éyk’“osméyeamdt‘you'I can't be helped!sk’""éykosméytdm3t‘'he/she/it/theysk’""éyk°¥osméytaldm3tcan't'youbefolkshelped! can'tcan'tbe helped’be helped!""

This paragraph indicates that the negative form involves adding a suffix to the verb, which is a clear indication of negation being marked by an affix.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph explicitly describes the addition of a suffix to the verb to form negative constructions.
2. The examples provided show the verb being modified with a negative suffix, which aligns with the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Omaha,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Omaha involves the use of negating particles such as ""bazhi"" and ""azhi."" These particles are placed after the verb to form negative statements. However, there is no explicit evidence in the provided text that these particles are phonologically bound to the verb as affixes or clitics. The descriptions suggest that they are separate particles rather than bound morphemes.

For example:
- Paragraph 1 mentions placing the negative particle ""bazhi"" between the verb and ""bi ama.""
- Paragraph 2 discusses placing the negating particle ""azhi"" between the verb and the command particle.
- Paragraph 7 states that to declare that somebody did not do something, the negating particle ""bazhi"" is placed after the verb.
- Paragraph 20 indicates that ""azhi"" combines tightly with the preceding verb, but this does not necessarily imply phonological binding as an affix or clitic.

The use of the term ""particle"" and the placement descriptions imply that these negating elements are separate words rather than bound morphemes. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine definitively that standard negation in Omaha is marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",1,0
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the method of standard negation in Washo directly. However, there is one paragraph that provides a clue:

**Paragraph 26:**
> The only apparent is the non-oecur-significant Interrogative; suffixes, rejected, stems pseudo-derived Themethedouble-transitive Directional Connective that were and the of variety Negative.-é°s distribution not nullified, action. in where cases thwarted, second verb, expressed--the by and commonly by one the of texts described also affixed is-unilinterrupted, counteracted This g4@p which now gone, expressed seauelexpected normally (but following the condition or action the eases with head the that characteristic on his in emphasizes e.g., true, clozed (especially empha-of meaning is situation described the that sizing it times At affixed. is it which to theme the of cessation or interruption Defunctive—-unil suffix thematic The Defunctive.-uyil 28.1. the but suffix this is also more 608 apt to be accidental.

This paragraph mentions a negative suffix ""-é°s"" that is used in negation. The term ""affixed"" is used, indicating that this suffix is attached to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- The paragraph explicitly mentions a negative suffix ""-é°s"" that is affixed to the verb.
- The term ""affixed"" suggests that the negative marker forms a phonological unit with the verb root.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Koasati,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Koasati can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative particle ""inkg"" and its usage in sentences, but it does not provide clear evidence of it being phonologically bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 2** discusses a defective verb that occurs in both affirmative and negative forms, but it does not specify the method of negation.
- **Paragraph 5** provides a comparison of active and stative verbal inflection, showing that negation involves portmanteau morphemes indicating both person and negation, which suggests that negation is marked on the verb.
- **Paragraph 7** mentions that prefixes are used for subject cross-reference in verbs, including negative markers.
- **Paragraph 8** describes the verb conjugation system, indicating that negative subject cross-reference markers are prefixed and that there is a negative complement suffix.
- **Paragraph 9** discusses the negative morpheme in other Muskogean languages and its relation to Koasati, suggesting that the negative complement is suffixed.
- **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negative agentive nouns and verbalized negative agentive forms, indicating that negation is marked on the verb.
- **Paragraph 11** reveals that the negative marker for class 2A verbs is revealed through the placement of the negative subject cross-reference marker and the negative complement.
- **Paragraph 12** shows that the negative cross-reference markers in class 2B verbs follow the compulsive/multiplicative suffix, indicating that negation is marked on the verb.
- **Paragraph 14** compares negative subject cross-reference suffixes across different classes, showing that negation is marked on the verb.
- **Paragraph 23** explicitly states that all negative markers in Koasati are portmanteau morphemes indicating both person and negation, and they cannot be decomposed synchronically, confirming that negation is marked on the verb.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Koasati involves affixes or modifications of the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking negation as a phonological unit with the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Chumash (Barbareño),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Chumash (Barbareño) can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative prefix ""e-"" is used to mark negation on the verb.

Paragraph 2 mentions that 12 out of 53 clauses have the negative prefix ""e-"", translating to 'so that... not...'. This indicates that the prefix ""e-"" is attached to the verb to mark negation.

Paragraph 5 explicitly states that ""Negation in Barbareno Chumash always appears in the form of the prefix -e-."" This confirms that the negative prefix ""e-"" is used consistently for negation in the language.

These pieces of evidence show that negation is marked by a prefix that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yuchi,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuchi can be marked by a pre-clitic that attaches to the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly mention the use of a negative pre-clitic (nP- or ni-) that attaches to the verb or verb phrase to indicate negation. For example:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the negative pre-clitic nC- at the beginning of the verb phrase.
- Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 6 discuss the placement of the negative pre-clitic in negative questions.
- Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 16 explain that the negative pre-clitic nP- is always attached and cannot be an independent particle.
- Paragraph 9 and Paragraph 14 provide examples of the negative pre-clitic being attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 30 and Paragraph 39 further illustrate the use of the negative pre-clitic in negative commands and habitual actions.

These examples demonstrate that the negative pre-clitic is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for marking standard negation through an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that the standard negation in Alsea involves a particle that precedes the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 1 mentions that ""the negative particle must precede the verb,"" and Paragraph 3 describes it as ""a particle of negation."" There is no indication that this particle is an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, it is described as a separate particle that precedes the verb, which does not meet the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine that standard negation in Alsea can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 both describe the negation marker as a particle that precedes the verb.
2. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that this particle is phonologically bound to the verb as an affix or clitic.
3. The negation marker is described as a separate particle, which does not meet the criteria for being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the standard negation in Arikara.

Paragraph 11 provides a detailed description of negative patterns in Arikara. It lists various verbs in their negative forms, showing a consistent pattern where the negative marker ""kaakA-"" or ""kaaka-"" is prefixed to the verb. Here are some examples extracted from the paragraph:

- ""kaakAtciikaahu’"" (do not drink)
- ""kaakAxciikadhu’"" (do not sing)
- ""kaakAtwaaWlhtiiku’"" (do not talk)
- ""kaakAxwaaWlhtiiku’"" (do not talk)
- ""kaakAhnooku’"" (do not make it)
- ""kaakAxunax"" (do not find it)

This pattern indicates that the negation in Arikara is marked by a prefix attached to the verb, which is a clear case of an affix.

Paragraph 14 further supports this by explaining that grammatical additions to the verb in Arikara are made by the addition of affixes that indicate various grammatical categories, including negation.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Arikara can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraph 11 explicitly shows the use of the negative prefix ""kaakA-"" or ""kaaka-"" attached to verbs to form negative sentences.
- Paragraph 14 confirms that affixes are used in Arikara to indicate grammatical categories, including negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Takelma,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the method of standard negation in Takelma as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph describes the use of the negative adverb ""wede"" to negate future and imperative forms. It states that the negative adverb ""wede"" is prefixed to the verb form to create negative future and imperative constructions.
   - Example: ""wede yana‘k‘ he will not go"" (wede + yana‘k‘).

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It reiterates that ""wede"" is used with inferential and potential modes to form negative constructions.
   - Example: ""wede d6“ma’/'n I SHOULD NOT HAVE KILLED HIM"".

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - It mentions that negative indefinites are preceded by the negative adverb ""ani‘"" or ""wede"", depending on the tense-mode of the verb.
   - Example: ""a’ni® gui‘ in no way, nowhere"".

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - It provides examples of the use of ""wede"" in negative constructions.
   - Example: ""we'de gui na‘t’ do not go anywhere!"".

5. **Paragraph 10**:
   - It discusses the use of ""wede"" in negative future constructions.
   - Example: ""wede yana‘k‘ he will not go"".

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the negative adverb ""wede"" is used to negate verbs in Takelma. The adverb ""wede"" is prefixed to the verb, indicating that it forms a phonological unit with the verb. This qualifies as a method of standard negation that involves an affix or clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence provided, standard negation in Takelma can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Jemez,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Jemez can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 6 mentions a ""negative prefix /W&/,"" which is a clear indication of a phonologically bound morpheme used for negation. Additionally, Paragraph 15 provides an example where the negative prefix /wf/ intervenes between parts of the pronominal prefix, further supporting the presence of a bound morpheme for negation.

**Reasoning:**
- **Paragraph 6:** The mention of a ""negative prefix /W&/"" directly indicates that negation can be marked by an affix bound to the verb.
- **Paragraph 15:** The example sentence shows the negative prefix /wf/ used within the verb complex, reinforcing the use of a bound morpheme for negation.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Zuni involves both a negative particle and a negative verb stem suffix. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""Two elements are required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, a negative particle and a negative verb stem suffix.""
2. **Paragraph 4** provides an example showing the negative suffix ""-k-"" in the negative form of the eventive intransitive verb.
3. **Paragraph 6** states that ""The negative suffix occurs after transitive subject agreement but before tense inflection.""
4. **Paragraph 10** gives an example illustrating the negative suffix ""-nam-"" in the verb form: ""k¥a'‘okyaccik'te'le’k'oSo-nam-kya"" (neg.woman.pot.wash-neg.-past) meaning ""The woman didn't wash the pot.""
5. **Paragraph 31** compares singular and plural forms of negation, showing the use of the negative suffix ""-nam-"" and ""-na:w-"" in different contexts.

From these points, it is clear that Zuni uses a negative suffix that attaches to the verb to mark negation. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined in the guidelines.

### Reasoning:
- The negative suffixes ""-k-"", ""-nam-"", and ""-na:w-"" are explicitly mentioned as part of the verb morphology in Zuni.
- These suffixes are bound morphemes that attach directly to the verb, indicating that negation is marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1",1,1
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Rama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions the use of the negative morpheme ""tahma/taama"" which can be divided into two morphemes ""tah/taa"" and ""ma"". It also provides examples where ""tahma"" is used as a suffix in verbal constructions, such as ""wark-i-ting-tahma—-u"" (work-3-do-NEG-TNS) meaning ""he never worked"".

2. **Paragraph 16** describes the negation particle ""aa"" which is prefixed to the verb in a preverbal position, as in ""nah rama aa-alkws-i"" (1 Rama NEG-speak-TNS) meaning ""I don't speak Rama"".

3. **Paragraph 49** provides examples of both ""aa"" and ""taama/tahma"" negations in subordinate clauses and with progressive aspect, showing their use in verbal constructions. For instance, ""suuli-kaasaay-auk~-baakur-uanimal-meat NEG 3-roast-PROG-TNS"" (she was not roasting meat) and ""nah rama alkwis-tahma"" (1 Rama talk-NEG) meaning ""I never talk Rama"".

These examples demonstrate that negation in Rama can be marked by affixes or modifications directly on the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tonkawa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Tonkawa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-abe-"" is directly attached to the verb theme, as illustrated in several examples.

**Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative suffix ""-abe-"" and provides examples such as ""yalxilna- to run away, plus the negative suffix -abe and the imperative suffix -u.""
- **Paragraph 2** outlines the position of the negative suffix in the verb form, showing that it is integrated into the verb structure.
- **Paragraph 5** explicitly states, ""The negative of any verb may be formed by adding the suffix -abe- directly to the theme."" Examples include ""yagb-ab-o'c"" (I do not hit him) and ""geigab-ab-o'"" (he does not hit me).
- **Paragraph 6** further supports this by showing the order of elements in the verb when the negative suffix is included: ""Theme — 2d pers. — Neg. — Fut. — Contin. — Mode.""

These examples and descriptions confirm that the negative suffix ""-abe-"" is an affix that attaches directly to the verb theme, thus marking standard negation in Tonkawa.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Tunica,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Tunica can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs describe the use of negative postfixes such as -aha, -k?aha, and -?aha, which are attached to verbs to indicate negation. These postfixes are phonologically bound to the verbs they modify.

For example:
- Paragraph 2 mentions the element -k preceding the negative postfix -?aha and the negative postfix -k?aha.
- Paragraph 5 provides examples of verbs with negative postfixes: haka'liwik?aha'ni (he would not stop), ?0'rus?aha'ni (he did not know), and tthpo’wistuk?oho'ni (he could not find her).
- Paragraph 8 contrasts positive and negative forms of verbs, showing that negative forms are created by adding -aha or -k?aha to the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Tunica involves affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Wappo. The key information is found in Paragraph 4:

- **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph explicitly discusses the formation of the negative in Wappo. It states that the negative is regularly formed by the postposition of ""la'ki,"" which is composed of ""la"" (not) and a suffix of unknown force. It also mentions that ""la'ki"" affects the preceding verb stem similarly to subordinating suffixes, often causing them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This indicates that the negation involves a change in the verb form due to the presence of ""la'ki.""

From this, we can infer that the negative marker ""la'ki"" interacts with the verb in a way that affects its phonological form, suggesting that the negation is marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",1,1
Ute,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Ute can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

2. The reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:

- Paragraph 1 describes various negative forms and suffixes that attach directly to verbs. For instance, the negative participle ""-ait-ϊ-"" and the negative verbalizing ""-ai-"" are mentioned. These forms indicate that negation can be marked by modifying the verb itself.
- Paragraph 2 further supports this by explaining that verbs can take a negative suffix or undergo a negative modification. Examples include verbs with negative suffixes like ""-apa-"" and ""-ywa'ai-"".
- Paragraph 3 also mentions verb-forming suffixes and their negative counterparts, reinforcing the idea that negation can be directly marked on verbs.
- Paragraph 4 and 5 provide additional examples of verb forms and their modifications, including negative forms.

Given these descriptions, it is evident that Ute employs affixes and modifications directly on verbs to indicate negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yurok,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yurok can be marked by a preverb that occurs before the verb. Specifically, the preverb ""neemee"" is used to negate verbs, as seen in multiple examples:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that ""neemee"" is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs.
- Paragraph 4 provides examples of ""neemee"" used in negation: ""Neemee wo hlee’"" (It was not accepted), ""Neemee wo weykee’"" (It was not finished), and others.
- Paragraph 16 further illustrates the use of ""neemee"" in negation: ""Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’"" (I don’t feel well), ""Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet"" (It’s not very windy here), and others.

Since ""neemee"" is a preverb that attaches to the verb and forms a phonological unit with it, it qualifies as an affix or clitic in the context of standard negation.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Nuuchahnulth,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Nuuchahnulth can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- Paragraph 2 provides examples of negation using the root ""vhj"" in Makah, which is closely related to Nuuchahnulth. The examples show that negation is marked by the clitic ""vhj"" attached to the verb, as in ""vhj<""`Q<pt9<r"" (not=TEMP=COND=1sg) and ""vhj<""`Q<rh9"" (not=TEMP=1sg). This indicates that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 4 also supports this by showing the use of ""vhj"" in negation constructions, such as ""vhj<""`Q<""`s<rH"" (not=TEMP=PINV=1sg) and ""vhj<""`Q<rh9"" (not=TEMP=1sg), further confirming that negation is marked by a clitic bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 6 provides additional evidence with examples like ""vhj<""`Q<""`s<rH"" (not=TEMP=PINV=1sg), showing the clitic ""vhj"" used for negation in Nuuchahnulth.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Nuuchahnulth involves the use of a clitic that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin) is marked by a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause or an unmarked indicative clause. The paragraphs do not provide evidence of negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, the negation is consistently described as involving a particle that precedes the clause.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Describes Pattern A, which consists of a negative particle followed by a nominalized clause.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that the negation particle is followed by a nominalized predicate.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Reiterates that the negation particle appears at the beginning of the clause followed by a nominalized predicate.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Indicates that the negation particle is used with predicates marked for irrealis mode or unmarked indicative clauses.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Describes Pattern C, which involves the negation particle followed by an unmarked indicative clause.

None of these descriptions suggest that the negation is marked directly on the verb through affixation, cliticization, or modification. Instead, the negation is marked by a separate particle that precedes the clause.

**Reasoning**:
- The negation in Columbia-Wenatchi is consistently described as involving a particle that precedes the clause, rather than an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.
- There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that negation is marked directly on the verb.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Hidatsa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Hidatsa can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-dhaa"" is attached to the predicate head to indicate clausal negation. This is clearly demonstrated in multiple examples, such as:

- (266) Macéédhaac.
  macéé-dhaa-c
  man-NEG-DECL
  ‘He is not a man.’

- (267) Maaˀiiˀúùdi madú wareeg, úˀsiadhaac.
  maaˀiiˀúùdi madú waree-g úˀsia-dhaa-c
  reason exist EVID-CRD arrive-NEG-DECL
  ‘Something must have happened, he hasn’t arrived.’

- (268) Hiirahbídhaa agáwaasd.
  hiirahbí-dhaa agáhee-waa-sd
  difficult-NEG suppose-1CAUS.DIR-DEF
  ‘I didn’t think it would be hard.’

These examples show that the negative suffix ""-dhaa"" is directly attached to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it. Additionally, the suffix ""-dhaa"" can be reduplicated, further indicating its bound nature.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Toqabaqita,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Toqabaqita can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative verb ""aqi"" can be used in conjunction with subject markers to form negation. For example, in the double negative construction, the negative verb ""aqi"" is combined with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker ""qe"" to form ""qe=aqi"" (3SG.NFUT=NEGV), which is phonologically bound and forms a single phonological word. This is evident in examples like:

- (17-2) A: Qo 2SG.NFUTriki-a see-3SG.OBJB: Qe=aqi. 3SG.NFUT=not.be.so
- (17-37a) Nau qe=aqi kwasi thaofa. 1SG 3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry

Additionally, the simple negative construction uses negative subject markers that are bound to the verb, such as ""kesi"" (3PL.NEG) in:

- (17-1) Keeroqa kesi fula. 3DU.NEG arrive 3DU

These examples demonstrate that negation in Toqabaqita involves phonologically bound elements, either through cliticization or affixation.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Aghu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in the language Aghu can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 5 provides examples such as ""joxodebaxe-n=dexo"" (they are not here) and ""nügutedafi-n=dexo"" (when we had not arrived yet), where the negation is marked by the clitic ""=de"" attached to the verb.
- Paragraph 7 further supports this with examples like ""da-de=dèxo"" (I didn’t come), showing the use of the clitic ""=de"" for negation.
- Paragraph 11 includes examples such as ""axi=dexo"" (I will not go) and ""adi-n=demuŋ-ge-nã"" (they do not want to eat), where negation is marked by the clitic ""=de"" and the verb modification.

These examples clearly indicate that negation in Aghu involves phonologically bound elements (clitics) attached to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Manambu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Manambu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

Paragraph 1 indicates that the negator ma: is used to negate verbal predicates in declarative non-habitual clauses, and it can be preposed to a special negative form of the verb. This form is often the same as the verb’s root, but about 50% of verbs undergo vowel changes when negated, which suggests a modification of the verb. Additionally, future tense in negative clauses is marked by postposing the negator ma: to the verb root, indicating that the negator forms a phonological unit with the verb.

Paragraph 13 further supports this by explaining that the general negator ma: negates a verbal predicate of a declarative non-habitual clause, and all person, number, and gender distinctions are neutralized on the verb. The non-future tense in negative clauses is expressed by preposing the negator to a special negative form, which often involves vowel changes in the verb root.

Paragraph 14 discusses the negation of questions, where the verb is marked with the dependent negation -ma:r-. This marker usually goes onto a non-future negative stem, indicating that the negation involves a modification of the verb form.

Paragraph 15 explains that in non-future negative constructions, the negator ma: precedes the negative verb form, and various constituents can intervene between the negator and the verb, focusing on the intervening constituent. This indicates that the negator and the verb form a phonological unit, supporting the idea of a clitic or affix-like behavior.

Paragraph 16 mentions that the negator ma: is used to negate non-verbs on their own, and the negator ak@s is used to negate habitual clauses with fully inflected verbs. This shows that negation involves specific markers that interact with the verb forms.

Paragraph 17 discusses non-first person negative imperatives, where the general prohibitive is marked with the suffix -tukwa, forming one phonological word with the verb root. This clearly indicates the use of an affix for negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Momu,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Momu can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative particle ""momu"" can attach to the verb as a clitic, as seen in examples like ""netyi=momu"" (throw.one[1|3sgS]=neg) and ""ai-kuw=momu"" (impf-consume\3sgS=neg). This indicates that negation is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Makasae,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Makasae can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 mentions the negative prefix ""ni-"" which is a verbal prefix that negates the meaning of the verb it is used with. This indicates that negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Motuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Motuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 2 provides examples of negative sentences where the negative particle ""toku"" is used in combination with verbs. For instance, in sentence 8-56, ""roohaha'hanna toku noingo-i-heeta-na"" (you will not do any big work), ""toku"" is the negative particle, and it is used with the verb ""noingo-i-heeta-na"" (do any big work). This indicates that negation involves a particle that is closely associated with the verb.

- Paragraph 5 mentions that the negative particle ""toku"" cannot intervene between aspectual verbs and the preceding medial verb or verb in Definite Future. This suggests that ""toku"" is phonologically bound to the verb in some constructions.

- Paragraph 6 provides further examples of ""toku"" being used to negate verbs, such as in sentence 9-26, ""tiko hoo ruupang toku nampamaapuk-u-u-ng"" (and the bamboo container did not become full quickly). Here, ""toku"" is used with the verb ""nampamaapuk-u-u-ng"" (become full quickly), indicating that the negation is directly associated with the verb.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Motuna can be marked by a particle that is phonologically bound to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Lavukaleve,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, it is clear that standard negation in Lavukaleve can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention the use of the negative verbal suffix -la to negate verbs. This suffix is directly attached to the verb, indicating that negation is marked through affixation. Additionally, examples such as ""alei -la -m"" (3sgmO- see -NEG -sgm) and ""vau -la -m"" (go -NEG -sgm) illustrate the use of the suffix -la in negating verbs.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Dla (Menggwa),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that negative irrealis is conveyed by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.
- **Paragraph 6** states that negative irrealis verbs differ from positive irrealis verbs by having an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem.
- **Paragraph 7** provides examples of negative realis and negative irrealis forms, showing the use of affixes ma- and -ma.
- **Paragraph 13** describes the formation of negative realis verbs using boke (class I) or boka (class II), which are bound forms.
- **Paragraph 15** further supports the use of negative irrealis affixes ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.
- **Paragraph 19** confirms that negative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus a following negative realis verb boke or boka.
- **Paragraph 29** reiterates that negative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus a negative realis verb boke or boka, which are separate phonological words but still bound forms.

These points collectively indicate that standard negation in Dla (Menggwa) involves affixes or modifications that are phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Duna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Duna can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is used to express negation on verbal predicates. This circumfix is phonologically bound to the verb, as it attaches to the verb root to form a negative stem. Examples from the text include:
   - ""na-ra-ya"" (NEG-be/sit-NEG) in ""antia-na-kana-si-ya"" (mother-SPEC-CS NEG-hold-NEG) meaning 'The mother didn’t have [any small change].'
   - ""na-ke-ya-o"" (NEG-see-NEG-PFV) in ""no na-ke-ya-o"" meaning 'I didn’t see.'
   - ""na-na-ya-na"" (NEG-eat-NEG-HAB) in ""no phuya na-na-ya-na"" meaning 'I don’t eat snake.'

These examples demonstrate that the negative circumfix ""na- -ya"" is an affix that attaches to the verb to indicate negation, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Taulil,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Taulil can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs describe the use of the negator ""kori"" in verbal clauses, which can be used immediately before the verb complex to negate it. This negator forms a phonological unit with the verb, as seen in examples such as ""kori tə-t∼təm=a"" (NEG 3PL.PST-IPFV∼know =PAT) and ""kori idə-p∼pau ngang"" (NEG 3N.PST-IPFV∼hungry 1SG). Additionally, the use of ""kori"" with verbal demonstratives further supports this conclusion.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Taiap,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in the language Taiap can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation marker ""wákare"" is used in conjunction with the irrealis form of the verb. This is seen in examples such as ""okɨ wákare"" (he didn’t go) and ""a-kru wákare"" (he didn’t eat). The verb stem changes to its irrealis form when negated, and the negation marker ""wákare"" is added.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Yimas,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Yimas can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative prefix ""ta-"" which is attached to the verb to indicate negation. For example, ""ta-ka-wa-t"" (NEG-1SG S-go-PERF) means 'I didn't go.'
- Paragraph 2 further illustrates the use of the negative prefix ""ta-"" in various contexts, such as ""ta-mpu-tpul-c-rm"" (NEG-3PL A-hit-PERF-DL) meaning 'They didn't hit those two.'
- Paragraph 6 discusses the use of ""ta-"" in serial verb constructions, indicating that the negative prefix can apply to the entire verb sequence, as in ""ta-ka-ak-mpi-wul-c-i"" (NEG-1SG A-push-SEQ-put down-VIII SG) meaning 'I did not push the canoe down into the water.'

These examples clearly show that negation in Yimas involves a prefix that attaches to the verb, thus forming a phonological unit with it.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine definitively whether standard negation in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs do not provide explicit examples or descriptions of negation strategies in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. They cover various aspects of the language, such as phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, but none directly address the method of standard negation.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Maybrat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Maybrat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The key evidence comes from the discussion of the negators ""fe"" and ""m-fe."" The clausal negator ""fe"" is used in clause-final position to negate the verb, as seen in examples like ""om m-ais fe"" (It is not raining) and ""ana m-asah fe"" (They do not laugh). Additionally, ""m-fe"" functions as a verb itself, taking a third person unmarked person prefix, as in ""arko m-fe"" (There is no firewood). This indicates that negation can indeed be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Asmat,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Asmat can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that the negation ""pok"" was found after the m-/mV- form of the verb, indicating that negation can be linked to a specific verb form.
- **Paragraph 3** describes a negative construction with ""pak"" which is used for standard negation.
- **Paragraph 6** specifies that only certain forms of the verb (m-/mV- and m-/mV-@) can precede negations, indicating a morphological relationship between the verb and the negation marker.
- **Paragraph 21** provides examples of negation markers ""opdk/pak"" and ""opow/pow"" being linked to the m-/mV- forms of the verb, further supporting the morphological binding of negation to the verb.

These points collectively indicate that negation in Asmat involves morphological processes that are bound to the verb, either through affixation or specific verb forms.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Kuot,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, it is evident that standard negation in Kuot is primarily marked by particles that are not phonologically bound to the verb. The primary negator ""tǝle"" and its variant ""tǝla"" are used before the negated constituent and do not attach to the verb. Additionally, the alternative negator ""mani"" also functions as a separate word. There is no indication of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb itself to mark standard negation.

Paragraph 1 (1.1.7 Negation) clearly states that the most general negator ""tǝle"" occurs before the negated constituent and is not bound to the verb. The example sentences provided show ""tǝle"" and ""mani"" as separate words preceding the verb or other constituents. There is no mention of any affixation or cliticization directly on the verb for negation purposes.

Paragraph 2 (1.1.8.3 Tense/irrealis) and other paragraphs further support this by not providing any evidence of bound morphemes for negation.

Given the information, it is clear that standard negation in Kuot is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 0",0,0
Imonda,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Imonda can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the negative suffix ""-m"" in verbal clauses, which is a clear indication of an affix used for negation. Additionally, Paragraph 22 describes the discontinuous negation marker ""sg...-me,"" where ""-me"" is a suffix attached to the verb. This confirms that negation in Imonda involves affixation directly on the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is evidence that standard negation in Nimboran can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, in Paragraph 21, the example ""bekdbaku kuo be, u6Mku - I did not kick above, I dibbled above"" shows a negation construction where ""kuo be"" is used to negate the verb ""bekdbaku"" (kick above). This indicates that the negation is marked in a way that is phonologically bound to the verb.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 21**: The example ""bekdbaku kuo be, u6Mku - I did not kick above, I dibbled above"" demonstrates that the negation ""kuo be"" is directly associated with the verb ""bekdbaku"". This suggests that the negation is marked in a way that is phonologically bound to the verb, either as a clitic or a modification of the verb itself.

### Conclusion:
1",0,1
Abun,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Abun is primarily marked by the use of two negative particles, ""yo"" and ""nde,"" which bracket the predicate. These particles are not affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb. Instead, they are separate words that function as particles and are used to mark the scope of negation in a sentence.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs that support this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Describes ""nde"" and ""yo"" as particles that are used for negation, with ""yo"" preceding the predicate and ""nde"" following it.
2. **Paragraph 3**: States that ""nde"" and ""yo"" are invariant particles that bracket the predicate to mark negation.
3. **Paragraph 5**: Explains that clause negation in Abun involves bracketing the verb phrase with ""yo"" and ""nde.""
4. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the scope of negation being determined by the placement of ""yo"" and ""nde"" around the predicate.
5. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions that ""yo"" and ""nde"" form a linked pair that bracket the predicate in negative sentences.
6. **Paragraph 16**: Clarifies that ""nde"" is a free form word and not bound to the verb, and it is used in conjunction with ""yo"" to form negative sentences.
7. **Paragraph 26**: States that the main NEG-marker ""nde"" is not attached to the verb and is frequently distant from the verb.

Given this information, it is evident that standard negation in Abun is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by separate particles that bracket the predicate.

**Conclusion**: 0",0,0
Meryam Mir,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Meryam Mir can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs indicate the use of the privative suffix ""-kak"" in negative imperatives, which attaches to the nominal form of the verb to indicate negation. This is evident in examples such as:

- (5.74) ""nole aro-kak"" (Neg eatN-Priv) meaning 'Don't eat it.'
- (2.114) ""nole aro-kak"" (Neg eatN-Priv) meaning 'Do not eat (it).'

These examples show that the privative suffix ""-kak"" is used to negate the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Hatam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we need to determine if standard negation in Hatam can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that Hatam has two negatives: ""big"" for declaratives and interrogatives, and ""au"" for imperatives. Both are described as negative adverbs that are always in clause-final position. This suggests that negation is not marked directly on the verb but rather by a separate word at the end of the clause.

2. **Paragraph 10** reiterates that the negative adverb ""big"" is always in clause-final position and provides an example where negation follows the complement clause, not the verb itself:
   ```
   (4. 1 40)*Dani di-ngat big nab yem dit-de siep.
   I SG-see not pig eat I SG-POS sw.potato
   I didn't see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
   ```

3. **Paragraph 11** provides another example of negation with ""big"" in a clause-final position:
   ```
   (4. 1 47)bi-mai big.
   Di-bui napia
   I SG-hit wild.pig PUR-die not
   I didn't strike the pig dead.
   ```

4. **Paragraph 14** discusses the combination of ""big"" with other aspectual adverbs but still maintains its clause-final position:
   ```
   (4.93)Yoni i-kwei ei Mar big-yo.
   they 3PL-come LOC Warmare not-yet
   They have not yet come to Warmare.
   ```

From these points, it is clear that the negation in Hatam is consistently marked by the negative adverb ""big"" placed at the end of the clause. There is no indication that negation is achieved through an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb itself. Instead, the negation is marked by a separate word that does not attach to the verb.

### Conclusion: 0

Standard negation in Hatam cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb based on the provided paragraphs. The negation is marked by a separate word ""big"" that is placed at the end of the clause.",0,0
Kwomtari,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Kwomtari can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in the use of the suffix -i for negation, which attaches to the verb.

2. Reasoning:
- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the adverb ""glei"" for negation and its conjunction with the clause-final negative suffix ""-i"" (§5.3.2). Example (34) shows the suffix -i attached to the verb ""feta-ne-a-ne"" to form ""feta-ne-a-ne-i"" for negation.
- Paragraph 7 further clarifies that if the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being preceded by ""glei"" (§7.2). Example (24) demonstrates this with ""feta-ne-a-ne-i"" for negation.
- Paragraph 13 also discusses the use of the suffix -i as a marker for negated clauses (§4.2.9). Example (105) shows ""glei fo-la-ne-i"" for negation.

These examples clearly indicate that negation in Kwomtari can be marked by a suffix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Inanwatan,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Inanwatan can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix ""-aigo"" is used to mark negation directly on the verb, as seen in the examples provided in Paragraphs 1, 3, and 14. This suffix attaches to the verb and forms a phonological unit with it, fulfilling the criteria for being considered an affix.

For instance:
- In Paragraph 1: ""(Nawo) n e-se-s-aigo."" (I am not going to walk.)
- In Paragraph 3: ""Generally, when the negative suffix -aigo follows a vowel, the transitional sound [j] (grapheme: y) or sometimes [d] is inserted at the morpheme break.""
- In Paragraph 14: ""...they did not carry it away."" (using the suffix -aigo to indicate negation).

These examples demonstrate that negation is marked directly on the verb through the suffix ""-aigo,"" which is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Iau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Iau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 5 states that negatives in Iau are marked by the particles 'ae' or 'ai', which immediately follow the verb or the verb and the clitic stative particle if present. This indicates that the negation particles are phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine the method of standard negation in Karkar-Yuri. The paragraphs do not contain clear information or examples related to the negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative sentences. The text is fragmented and lacks specific details about the grammatical construction of negation in the language.

1. The paragraphs provided are either too fragmented or do not contain relevant information about the method of standard negation in Karkar-Yuri. There is no clear mention of affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb that are used to mark negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates. Without explicit examples or descriptions of how negation is constructed, it is impossible to determine the method of standard negation in this language.

Conclusion: 0",1,0
Yelî Dnye,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yelî Dnye, the following points are relevant to determining whether standard negation can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb:

1. **Paragraph 4**: ""Ngem Kaawa NEG-D-FUT go.PCT IT.PLPRX . DU . S B. Ngem and Kaawa won 't be going."" This example shows the use of ""NEG-D-FUT"" as a prefix to the verb ""go.PCT,"" indicating that negation is marked directly on the verb.

2. **Paragraph 5**: ""The negative < daa> has different surface forms, depending on its environment, as displayed in Table 2. 1 .9. 1."" This suggests that the negative morpheme ""daa"" can attach to verbs, modifying them to express negation.

3. **Paragraph 15**: ""For some combinations of TMA with Subject Person, yi- merges with the verbal prenucleus, producing a new portmanteau morpheme."" This indicates that morphemes, including those for negation, can merge with the verb's prenucleus, forming a phonological unit.

4. **Paragraph 20**: ""Some forms of the morphemes that manifest these factors can be seen easily enough as affixes, but others are merged into the prenucleus, with confusing results."" This further supports the idea that negation can be marked by affixes or merged morphemes in the verb's structure.

5. **Paragraph 27**: ""NEG group one there CI.PRES . 3 . SB standing IT.CI.PRE S . 3 S G . S B There are many groups of people there. Example (75) also illustrates the preference Rossel people have for understatements. Literally it means 'Not one group of people is standing there.'"" This example shows the use of ""NEG"" in the context of a verb phrase, indicating that negation is integrated into the verb structure.

6. **Paragraph 33**: ""The continuous root of a verb is also used as a nominal item, to name the event. When used this way, the object affected by the event can be made explicit, but the Agent of the action cannot be specified."" This paragraph indirectly supports the idea that verb roots can be modified for various grammatical purposes, including negation.

From these points, it is clear that negation in Yelî Dnye can be marked by a modification of the verb or by an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

**Reasoning:**
The examples and descriptions provided in the paragraphs indicate that negation in Yelî Dnye involves morphemes that attach to the verb, either as prefixes or merged forms, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb. This satisfies the criteria for marking standard negation through affixation or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Sentani,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, standard negation in Sentani can indeed be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG attaches directly to the verb root, as mentioned in Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3. This circumfix negates the verb itself rather than having scope over the entire sentence, which fits the criteria for standard negation in dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1:** It explicitly states that the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG attaches directly to the verb root.
   - **Paragraph 3:** It reiterates that the negative circumfix ə- -j NEG is part of the PRE category and attaches to the verb root.
   - **Paragraph 53:** Provides an example of the negative circumfix in use, showing that it attaches to the verb root.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Mpur,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Mpur is marked by the adverb ""jan,"" which always occurs clause-finally. There is no indication in the provided text that negation is marked by an affix, clitic, or any modification of the verb itself. The examples given, such as ""De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap ku Bwatem"" and ""Iwma-n-kakokor jan,"" show that ""jan"" functions as a separate word (adverb) and not as a bound morpheme or modification of the verb.

Given the information, it is clear that standard negation in Mpur is not marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Instead, it is marked by a separate adverb that follows the clause.

2. **Conclusion:** 0",0,0
Mehek,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Mehek can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negative suffix -nak attaches directly to the verb stem, as seen in several examples:

- Paragraph 1 mentions that the primary negative morpheme is an invariant word iki, but it occasionally co-occurs with a suffix -nak on the verb.
- Paragraph 6 explicitly states that one way of expressing negation is by adding a suffix -nak to the verb.
- Paragraph 8 provides an example where the suffix -nak attaches directly to the verb stem.
- Paragraph 23 and Paragraph 30 further illustrate the use of the negative suffix -nak on the verb.

These examples confirm that the negative suffix -nak is phonologically bound to the verb, thereby marking standard negation.

Abui,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, it is evident that standard negation in Abui can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. 

Reasoning:
- Paragraph 3 explicitly states that ""Abui clause is negated with the verb naha ‘not be’."" This verb follows the negated VP and is glossed as NEG. Examples (210a) and (210b) show the negator naha following the verbs nee ‘eat’ and tukoi ‘be strong’, respectively, to negate the whole clause.
- Paragraph 4 further supports this by showing that the verb naha ‘not be’ can occur as a single predicate in a clause and combine with arguments, indicating its role in negation.
- Paragraph 6 mentions that negation, along with other elements like affirmative predicate markers and anaphoric demonstratives, is found in the right edge or right periphery of the clause, reinforcing the idea that negation is closely tied to the verb phrase structure.

These points collectively indicate that the negation in Abui is indeed marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

To determine if standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb, we need to look for specific evidence in the provided paragraphs. Here are the relevant findings:

1. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions two forms used by Abu' speakers to express negation: ""uwa'"" (not) and ""duwa'"" (nothing). However, it does not provide information on whether these are affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb.

2. **Paragraph 31**: This paragraph provides an example of negation:
   - ""25. k-u-k-a-ha-' 3SGFA-IR-NONPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU 'She did not hit her.' uwa' not""
   - ""26. alemam n-a-fan duwa' men 3PLMA-R-sit nothing 'The men sat doing nothing.'""

   In the first example, ""uwa'"" appears to be a separate word following the verb phrase, indicating it might be a particle rather than an affix or clitic. The second example uses ""duwa'"" similarly as a separate word.

3. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the prohibitive mood using the negative verbal lexeme ""ko'isi"" ('don't'), which can be used singly or following other verb forms. This suggests that ""ko'isi"" is a separate word rather than an affix or clitic.

4. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides a structure for sentences expressing negation: ""NEG(s) --> S ++ NEG."" This implies that negation is marked by a separate element (NEG) rather than an affix or clitic attached to the verb.

Based on the provided paragraphs, the evidence suggests that negation in Arapesh (Abu) is typically marked by separate words (particles) rather than affixes, clitics, or modifications of the verb. Therefore, it is not possible to determine that standard negation in Arapesh (Abu) can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 0",0,0
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine that standard negation in Korafe involves the use of affixes or modifications of the verb. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the negative focus marker ""jo"" and the negative deverbal ""ae"" which usually bracket the segment within which negation holds. This indicates that the verb is modified by the negative deverbal ""ae"".

2. **Paragraph 3** provides an example where the verb ""aira"" (he went) is negated by ""jo"" and ""ae"" as in ""jo ning-ae=ri"" (I didn't hear). This shows the use of the negative deverbal ""ae"" attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4** states that the negative deverbal is an essential constituent of all negative predications, and it usually combines with the copula ""ri"". This further confirms the use of the negative deverbal ""ae"" in negation.

4. **Paragraph 5** explains that negation of predications in Korafe is signaled by the combination of the negative focus marker ""jo"" and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative deverbal ""ae"" at its terminus.

5. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the negative deverbal ""ae"" terminates the negated segment, indicating that it is bound to the verb.

6. **Paragraph 7** provides an example where the verb ""mutoro"" (we will give) is negated by ""jo"" and ""ae"" as in ""jo mut-oro y-ae+areva"" (we will not give and you will not take).

7. **Paragraph 8** mentions that the negative deverbal ""ae"" can occur without the negative specifier ""jo"" and still function as a negation marker.

8. **Paragraph 9** states that the scope of negation obligatorily extends over both verbs within all standardized clause sequences, and the morphemes that bracket negation, ""jo ... ae"", must bracket both verbs together.

9. **Paragraph 10** mentions that the negative deverbal ""ae"" is used to negate verbal predications and functions like a negative participle.

10. **Paragraph 11** provides an example where the verb ""s-ae"" (not saying) is used as a negative deverbal.

11. **Paragraph 12** mentions that the negative deverbal ""ae"" can function similarly to a participle, indicating its bound nature to the verb.

### Conclusion: 1

Standard negation in the language Korafe can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.",1,1
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Alamblak can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides an example of a negative hortative verb form that exhibits a morphological negative form with the possible exception of the form of the declarative present verb with ""-kah"". This indicates that negation can be marked morphologically on the verb.

2. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph mentions that the hortative present tense form of the verb is the only verb form which exhibits a morphological negative form, suggesting that there is a specific morphological marker for negation on the verb.

3. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph provides an example where the negative marker ""nt"" is used in a sentence, indicating that negation can be marked directly on the verb.

Given these pieces of evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Alamblak can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in I'saka is marked by a clause-final particle ""mi"" and not by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that negation is expressed with the negative particle ""mi,"" which appears clause-finally. Examples provided show ""mi"" at the end of the clause, following the verb and any other elements:
   - (216) k-ei Pi mi. 'It won't rain.'
   - (217) Wasa dina taka mi. 'My basket isn't heavy.'

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that negation is marked once per clause and always at the end of the clause, following the predicate and any oblique nominals:
   - (270) Di wii-na mi. 'I'm not sick.'
   - (271) Bu dina mi. 'That's not mine.'

3. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 10** further support that the negative particle ""mi"" is clause-final and not verb-final, indicating that it is not phonologically bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** provide additional examples of ""mi"" used in various contexts, consistently appearing at the end of the clause, not attached to the verb:
   - (219) Dina mi. '(That's) not mine.'

Given this consistent pattern, it is evident that the negation in I'saka is marked by a separate particle ""mi"" that is not phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, standard negation in I'saka cannot be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 0",0,0
Urim,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Urim can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the verbal negator ""ake"" is used in verbal clauses and can occur immediately before or after the subject, or between the subject and the verb if the subject is fronted. This negator is phonologically bound to the verb, as seen in examples like ""Ake kil atning"" (NEG 3sg listen.R) meaning ""He did not listen."" Additionally, the negator ""ake"" is also used in verbless equative and descriptive clauses, further indicating its role in standard negation.

2. The evidence from the paragraphs shows that ""ake"" functions as a bound morpheme in negating verbs, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation involving a phonologically bound element.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Abau,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Abau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 5** (7.3.1 Negating verbal clauses) describes the use of the negation markers ""pey"" and ""pa"" which occur clause-finally. These markers are used to negate clauses with imperfective and perfective aspects respectively. The examples provided show that these markers are phonologically bound to the verb phrase, indicating that negation is marked by a modification of the verb phrase.

- **Paragraph 10** (7.4.2 Usage of imperfective speech marker o) mentions the use of the speech marker ""o"" for emphatic negation, which is a modification of the verb phrase through intonation contour. This further supports the idea that negation can be marked by modifying the verb.

- **Paragraph 15** (7.3.2 Negating verbless clauses) discusses the use of the negation marker ""lopa"" in verbless clauses, which is a separate word and not phonologically bound to the verb. However, this does not negate the evidence from other paragraphs that show phonologically bound negation markers.

- **Paragraph 16** (7.3.3 Additional functions of negator korey) describes ""korey"" as a negator that can be used in combination with clause-final negation markers ""pey"" or ""pa,"" indicating that negation can be marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb phrase.

- **Paragraph 17** (7.3.5 Negation markers in subordinate clauses) shows that the perfective negation marker ""pa"" and the nominalising negator ""lopa"" can be used in subordinate clauses, with ""pa"" being phonologically bound to the verb phrase.

Given this evidence, it is clear that standard negation in Abau can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Chamorro,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Chamorro can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that Chamorro has three ways of expressing sentence negation: with the sentential negative ""ti,"" with a negative verb, or with a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. This indicates that negation can be integrated into the verb itself, as seen with negative verbs.
- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences using ""ti"" for negation, but it also mentions negative verbs like ""tåya’"" (not exist) and ""tai"" (not have), which inherently carry the negation within the verb form.
- **Paragraph 7** lists negative verbs such as ""tai"" (not have), ""taigui"" (not be at a location), ""tåya’"" (not exist), ""cha’"" (better not, don’t), and ""mungnga"" (don’t, let it not be). These verbs inherently include negation, showing that negation can be part of the verb morphology.
- **Paragraph 24** reiterates that negative sentences in Chamorro can be formed with a sentential negative ""ti,"" a negative verb, or a syntactically focused negative indefinite. This confirms that negative verbs are a standard method of negation.

Given these points, it is clear that Chamorro uses negative verbs, which are modifications of the verb to express negation. This fits the criteria of being phonologically bound to the verb.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Awtuw,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, it is clear that standard negation in Awtuw can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions the use of the negative prefix ""ka-/ki-"" which fills the first slot in the verb complex to negate any verbal predicate. Paragraph 6 further elaborates on this by providing examples of morphological negation with the prefix ""ka-/kə-"" used to negate clauses with verbal predicates. This prefix is phonologically bound to the verb, as shown in the examples provided.

For instance:
- ""Awt i y kə-w-əy-re"" (Awtiy NG-NF-go-FU) translates to ""Awtiy isn’t going.""
- ""Awt i y-re wan ka-d-uwpo-ka"" (Awtiy-o 1SG NG-FA-see-PF) translates to ""I haven’t seen Awtiy.""

These examples demonstrate that the negative prefix attaches directly to the verb, forming a phonological unit with it.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Mian,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Mian can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of the suffix `-im` for negation in the perfective aspect, which is attached to the verb stem.
- **Paragraph 2** describes the negative clitic `=ba`, which attaches to the verb and follows the subject suffix or tense suffix.
- **Paragraph 5** discusses the negative pronoun suffix `-kob` that attaches to roots of the simple bound series and co-occurs with the negative clitic `=ba`.

These examples clearly show that negation in Mian involves affixes and clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Chácobo,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Chácobo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs provide evidence of this:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions the verb ""ak"" (do) in combination with the negative morpheme ""yáma"" (not), indicating that ""yáma"" is used as a negative marker.
- **Paragraph 2** describes a regretative auxiliary construction involving the auxiliary verb ""i"" and a bare verb root with the negative morpheme ""=ma"".
- **Paragraph 4** states that the free form ""yáma"" (negative) can interrupt elements in the verb complex, indicating its role in negation.
- **Paragraph 5** provides examples of negated verbs using the morpheme ""yáma"".
- **Paragraph 6** gives examples of verbs combining with the negative marker ""=yama"".
- **Paragraph 7** shows the negative clitic ""=ma"" used in declarative contexts.
- **Paragraph 10** provides examples of negative constructions with the morpheme ""=yáma"".
- **Paragraph 19** illustrates the layering of position 2 suffixes involving the negative morpheme ""yáma"".
- **Paragraph 29** explains that the marker of verbal and clausal negation is ""=yáma"" in all other construction types.

These paragraphs collectively demonstrate that the negative morpheme ""yáma"" can attach to verbs as an affix or clitic, thereby marking standard negation in Chácobo.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the paragraphs provided, it is evident that standard negation in Hup can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The examples (31) and (32) show the use of the suffix `-nˆ¤h` directly attached to the verb to indicate negation. This is clearly an affix.
   - Example (31): `ham-nˆ¤h-ay` (go-NEG-INCH) translates to ‘(I’m) not going.’
   - Example (32): `/ãh b’ˆ¤yˆ/ ham-nˆ¤h tán-áh` (1sg only go-NEG FUT.CNTR-DECL) translates to ‘I alone will not go!’

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes `-nˆ¤h` as a verbal consonant-initial Boundary Suffix that receives primary stress within the verb word. It is explicitly stated that `-nˆ¤h` is a suffix used for negation in declarative clauses.
   - The paragraph also mentions that the negative marker `-nˆ¤h` usually takes the place of the Boundary Suffix on the verb stem in affirmative clauses, indicating its role as an affix.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides further examples of the use of `-nˆ¤h` in negation within verb compounds and verb phrases.
   - Example (13a): `/ãh tˆ¤h-a‡n/ ih-/u‚h-té-h, way-nˆ¤h tég` (1sg ask-APPLIC-FUT-DECL go.out-NEG FUT) translates to ‘I’m going to ask him that he not go out.’

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the scope of negation with `-nˆ¤h` over the entire verbal predicate, reinforcing that `-nˆ¤h` is used as a suffix attached to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph explicitly states that the most common or basic form of negation in Hup involves a negative suffix `-nˆ¤h` that is used exclusively with verbal predicates.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph reiterates that Hup prefers a morphological strategy for the negation of clauses, involving the negative marker `-nˆ¤h` as a suffix on the verb stem.

### Conclusion: 1

The evidence from the provided paragraphs clearly indicates that standard negation in Hup can be marked by an affix (`-nˆ¤h`) that is phonologically bound to the verb. Therefore, the correct option is 1.",1,1
Kwaza,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Kwaza can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. The negative morpheme -he- is a bound verbal morpheme that precedes person and mood marking, as illustrated in multiple examples. For instance, in the sentence ""ja-'he-da-ki"" (eat-NEG-1S-DEC), the negation is marked by the suffix -he- attached to the verb root. Additionally, the negative habitual morpheme -hͿsi also replaces the verb’s mood marker, indicating that negation can be integrated into the verb morphology.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Huambisa,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Huambisa can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several paragraphs explicitly mention the use of negative suffixes -t͡ʃa and -t͡ʃau, which attach to verbs and other elements to indicate negation.

Paragraph 1 mentions the negative verbal morpheme -t͡ʃa attached to the copula verb a. Paragraph 5 further elaborates on the negative suffixes -t͡ʃa and -t͡su, which are used in different contexts to mark negation on verbs. Paragraph 6 also discusses the verbal negative suffix -t͡ʃa and its use in negation. These instances confirm that negation in Huambisa involves affixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Cocama,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Cocama can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The evidence is found in several paragraphs that describe the use of the negative particles tɨma and ni, and their interaction with other morphemes.

Paragraph 1 mentions that the morpheme =pura can attach to the negative particle tɨma, indicating that negation can be marked by a clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. This is further supported by examples where tɨma is used to negate the whole clause or verb phrase, and =pura attaches to it, as seen in examples (31a-c).

Paragraph 3 provides additional evidence by showing that tɨma can appear in various positions within the clause to negate different constituents, including verbs. The examples (93a-f) illustrate how tɨma negates verbs and verb phrases, confirming that negation can be marked by a particle that interacts closely with the verb.

Paragraph 7 reiterates the use of tɨma and ni as negative particles, with tɨma being used to negate the whole clause or verb phrase. This supports the conclusion that negation in Cocama involves particles that are phonologically bound to the verb or clause they negate.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Tiriyo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in the language Tiriyo can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions ""negative clauses built around the negative verbal form"" and refers to section 5.4.3.1.3, which implies that there is a specific negative form of the verb.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of the negative particle _ta(ike) and _wa(a) for non-verbal negation, but it also mentions that the supine form of the verb is negated with _ta(ike), indicating that negation can be directly associated with the verb.
3. **Paragraph 10** describes a verbal negative suffix -sewa, which is historically derived from the negative particle wa, indicating that negation can be marked by a suffix attached to the verb.
4. **Paragraph 23** explicitly lists ""Negative forms"" under section 5.4.3.1.3, which suggests that there are specific morphological forms for negation.
5. **Paragraph 30** provides examples of negative forms of verbs, such as ""in-akoronma-ewa_w-a-e"" (I am not helping him/her) and ""i-kéhtun-jewa émé"" (You are not screaming), where the negative marker -ewa is attached to the verb.

These examples and descriptions indicate that negation in Tiriyo can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being phonologically bound to the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Ticuna,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ticuna, it is evident that standard negation in Ticuna can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

2. The reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:

- Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the negative existential verb ""tåʼu"" and its variants, which are used to negate existential and topical-locational predicates. This verb appears in various forms, such as ""tåʼú-gù"" and ""tåʼú-ʼü̃́,"" indicating that it can be inflected and thus bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 2 discusses the use of ""tãů"" as a standard negator, which is described as a phonologically anomalous word that likely originated from a phonetic reduction of ""tåʼú-ʼü̃́."" This suggests that ""tãů"" is a bound form used for negation.
- Paragraph 3 further supports the use of ""tãů"" as a general marker for negative polarity, occurring with various types of predicative phrases, both verbal and non-verbal.
- Paragraph 4 provides examples of ""tãů"" being used in different contexts, including declarative utterances, interrogative utterances, and exclamative utterances, indicating its flexibility and bound nature in marking negation.
- Paragraph 5 discusses the use of ""tãů"" in privative negation, where it is combined with the verb ""ã̄"" to express the lack of possession, further indicating its role as a bound negator.
- Paragraph 6 mentions the use of ""tãů"" in pro-sentential negation, where it functions as a universal negation marker, similar to the English ""no.""
- Paragraph 7 and 8 provide additional examples of ""tãů"" being used in various negation contexts, including prohibitive constructions and rhetorical questions, reinforcing its role as a bound negator.

Conclusion: 1",0,1
Huitoto (Murui),"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), it is clear that standard negation in the language can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the standard negative marker ""-ñe"" is used to negate verbs, as shown in multiple examples. This marker is described as an affix that attaches to the verb, indicating that negation is achieved through morphological means.

For instance, in Paragraph 1, it is stated:
""Negation of predicates is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’).""

Examples provided in the same paragraph illustrate this:
(10.1) a. ɨɨ-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-LK-1sg
‘I swim’
b. ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I don’t swim’

Additionally, Paragraph 2 summarizes:
""Murui negation involves the morphological process of affixation, where negative markers are added to a corresponding positive in both main and subordinate clauses.""

These descriptions and examples confirm that the standard negation in Huitoto (Murui) is marked by an affix that attaches to the verb, fulfilling the criteria for a phonologically bound negation marker.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Iquito can be marked by an affix or a modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 5**: It explicitly mentions that the negative morpheme `-ji` is attached to the verb root in ji-caa negation. This morpheme is described as a portmanteau morpheme encoding both negation and clause-type information. The fact that it attaches to the verb root indicates that it is an affix.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph confirms that some negative clauses can be marked solely by the negative morpheme `-ji`, further supporting that `-ji` is a bound morpheme used for negation.

3. **Paragraph 7**: It describes the two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito, one of which involves the negative morpheme `-ji` in combination with the negative particle `caa`. The negative morpheme `-ji` is suffixed to the verbal root, indicating that it is an affix.

4. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph reiterates that in interrogative and subordinate clauses, the negative morpheme `-ji` is marked on the verb, and the negative marker `caa` follows the verb.

5. **Paragraph 38**: The schematic structure of ji-caa negation shows that `-ji` is marked after the verbal root, reinforcing that it is an affix.

6. **Paragraph 26**: It mentions that the negative morpheme `-ji` is attached to the verbal stem followed by tense/aspect information, followed by the negative particle `caa`.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, it is evident that standard negation in Movima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Affixation and Cliticization**:
   - Paragraph 2 (12.5.1) mentions that the negative particle ""kas"" forms a negative clause and that the predicate is morphologically modified. Specifically, it states that action nominalization through ""-wa"" occurs when the predicate is a verb.
   - Example (221) from Paragraph 2 illustrates this:
     ```
     kas ona-ye-na-wa=sne os juyeni n-as Tirinra
     NEG know-BE.person-DR-NMZ=f.a ART.n.p person obl-ART.n Trinidad
     ‘She didn’t know anyone in Trinidad.’
     ```
     Here, the verb ""ona-ye-na"" (know) is nominalized with ""-wa"" to form the negative construction.

2. **Modification of the Verb**:
   - Paragraph 2 also indicates that if the predicate already contains a negative affix, it is not additionally nominalized. This implies that verbs can inherently carry negative markers.
   - Examples (223) and (224) show verbs with the irrealis infix ""<a’>"" used in negative contexts:
     ```
     kas rey yok-a’-na=as n-is majniwa=a
     NEG again catch-IRR-DR=n.a obl-ART.pl child_of=n
     ‘It [the rat] did not catch any of its [the hen’s] children.’
     ```
     ```
     che nokowa kas juye<ka’>ni
     and right_now NEG person<IRR>
     ‘And now, no one will be there.’
     ```

3. **Reduplication and Suppletion**:
   - Paragraph 3 (7.15.1) describes that in a negative main clause, the predicate either contains a negative element or is converted into a relational noun by action nominalization.
   - Example (256) illustrates this:
     ```
     kas joro-wa=n
     NEG sleep-NMZ=2
     ‘Because you probably won’t sleep anymore.’
     ```
     Here, the verb ""joro"" (sleep) is nominalized with ""-wa"" to form the negative construction.

4. **Irrealis Marker**:
   - Paragraph 1 (10.3) discusses the irrealis marker ""<a’>"" which functions as a marker of existential negation in negative contexts.
   - Example (61) from Paragraph 1:
     ```
     kas tij-a’-ka:rim
     NEG work_at-IRR-BE.utensiles
     ‘Nobody is at work.’
     ```

These examples demonstrate that Movima employs affixation (e.g., ""-wa""), cliticization (e.g., internal clitics), and modification of the verb (e.g., irrealis marker ""<a’>"") to mark standard negation. Therefore, it is clear that standard negation in Movima can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:

Bora,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Bora can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Several examples illustrate this:

- Paragraph 1: ""teha? o akpakhmnm-thm-(nè)"" and ""teha? o a:hi§è-thé-thm-(nè)"" show the use of the suffix -thm for negation.
- Paragraph 2: ""max$ho-thm-(nè)"" and ""phé:-thm-nè"" further confirm the use of -thm as a negative suffix.
- Paragraph 6: ""teha? o max$ho-thm-(nè)"" and ""max$ho-thm-(nè)"" again demonstrate the use of -thm for negation.
- Paragraph 7: ""khé?'é-thmm-:Bè"" and ""tfépó-ra-thmm-:Be"" show the negative suffix -thmm.
- Paragraph 8: ""max$ho-thé-thm-(nè)"" and ""max$ho-thé-thm-(nè)"" illustrate the use of -thm in negation.
- Paragraph 13: ""phé-^ti-(pè)"" and ""mé:nm-ti-(pè)"" show the use of -ti for prohibitive negation.

These examples consistently show that negation in Bora involves the use of affixes or modifications directly on the verb.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Wari',"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Wari' can be marked by a modification of the verb or an affix/clitic that is phonologically bound to the verb. Several paragraphs indicate the presence of bound morphemes for negation:

- Paragraph 2 mentions the use of 'omca and 'omtocoi, where 'om is glossed as ""not:exist"" and appears to be bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 7 discusses the use of verbal modifiers such as 'a/'ara and mao for negation, which are described as postverbal modifiers, indicating they are bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 23 shows 'omcamaoca, where 'om is again used as a bound morpheme indicating negation.
- Paragraph 30 mentions the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara for negation in simple or COMP sentences, requiring the use of Tenseless VICS, further indicating that these modifiers are bound to the verb.
- Paragraph 48 provides an example of 'omxija'macom, where 'om is used as a bound morpheme for negation.

These examples collectively demonstrate that Wari' employs bound morphemes (affixes or clitics) for marking standard negation.

Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Aymara (Central). Here are the relevant excerpts:

1. **Paragraph 4**: ""the infinitive ending), indicates the action; in the negative, verforming possibility ~Vquitiis added (cf.""
2. **Paragraph 9**: ""Thenegative verbstem; marks the negative. ‘he is lazy.'""

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Aymara (Central) uses the suffix ""-ti"" to mark negation on verbs. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that standard negation can be marked by an affix.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraphs 4, 9, 10, 11, 16, 21, 22, 28, 30, and 42 all mention the use of the suffix ""-ti"" for negation, which is attached to the verb.
- The use of ""-ti"" as a suffix directly on the verb root or stem confirms that negation in Aymara (Central) can be marked by an affix.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Trumai can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Negation Particle ""tak""**:
   - Paragraph 3: ""The only difference between negative and affirmative Imperative for Transitive verbs is that in the negative modality the particle waki follows the verb rather than precedes it.""
   - Paragraph 12: ""To negate verbal predicates, the Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as auxiliaries.""
   - Paragraph 14: ""sa tak ka_in = hachi. dance Neg Foc/Tens 1 Cop ‘(No) I am not going to dance.’""
   - Paragraph 19: ""The negation of the DAT argument and other kinds of NPs usually employs the negator tak.""
   - Paragraph 36: ""Locative predicates are negated with the verbal negation particle tak.""

2. **Negation in Imperative Constructions**:
   - Paragraph 30: ""For the expression of the negative Imperative, there is the particle wanach. This particle follows the verb rather than preceding it, and it is found with (Extended) Intransitive verbs modified by tak.""

3. **Negation in Declarative Sentences**:
   - Paragraph 6: ""The negation particle tak is used for both inalienable and alienable possessive predicates, negating the verb.""
   - Paragraph 10: ""When in the negative modality, locative predicates employ the Negation particle tak to negate the predicate.""

4. **Examples of Negation**:
   - Paragraph 6: ""amitakka_inchi-n. speak Neg Foc/Tens Cop-3Abs ‘He is not speaking (now, for some reason not specified here).’""
   - Paragraph 14: ""sa tak ka_in = hachi. dance Neg Foc/Tens 1 Cop ‘(No) I am not going to dance.’""
   - Paragraph 19: ""hai-ts anuk hi adifle midoxos. 1-Erg Neg 2 sister call ‘(It was) not me (who) called your sister.’""

These examples and descriptions clearly indicate that the negation particle ""tak"" is phonologically bound to the verb, either following the verb directly or modifying the verb in combination with other elements. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion: 1",0,1
Apinayé,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that standard negation in Apinayé can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

- Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Negation of intransitive (77-78) and transitive (79) verbal predicates is invariably encoded by the clitic sequence ket=ne."" This indicates that the clitic sequence ket=ne is phonologically bound to the verb and is used to mark negation.
  
- Paragraph 5 provides examples of negation in verbal predicates, showing the use of the clitic sequence ket=ne. For instance, ""pa kt paj ic-pikud"" (I won’t get lost) and ""na pa a-t- ket=ne"" (I didn’t dream about you) clearly illustrate the use of ket=ne as a bound clitic for negation.

- Paragraph 7 further confirms that ""Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated. Nominal predicates are negated with the clause-final clitic ket, verbal predicates with the clitic sequence ket=ne."" This reinforces the idea that the clitic sequence ket=ne is used specifically for negating verbal predicates and is phonologically bound to the verb.

- Paragraph 13 discusses the morphological makeup of the negative clitics, suggesting a verbal diachronic origin and their current status as clitics that co-occur with verbs.

Given these points, it is clear that Apinayé uses a clitic sequence (ket=ne) that is phonologically bound to the verb to mark standard negation in declarative sentences involving dynamic verbal predicates.

2. **Conclusion:** 1",0,1
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the negation in Yagua:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""negative suffixes which may or may not be restricted to Vainilla-ta or -tya precede (V) and the main Cahocuma older strategies which Loretoyacu (SJL) dialect."" This indicates that there are negative suffixes in Yagua, which are bound morphemes attached to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 15** states, ""Negation is of constituents semantically correlates with constituents in preverbal position."" This suggests that negation in Yagua involves some morphological marking related to the verb, although it does not explicitly confirm if it is bound to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 31** provides an example: ""Néé The néé shows pattern common most following verb, as in: ryuvamyuuyjijita for of ambiguity similar is néé form to arimityoodadéérty. riy-jyuvay-muuy rimityu-jada-dee-ryy NEG 3PL-kill-COMPLT JIITA old:one-FEMININE-DIM-dear 'They didn't kill the old lady’."" This example shows the negative particle ""néé"" preceding the verb, indicating that negation can be marked by a particle that is not necessarily bound to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 16** lists ""negative"" among other clitics and affixes, suggesting that negation can be marked by a clitic or affix in Yagua.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Yagua employs negative suffixes and possibly clitics for marking negation, which are phonologically bound to the verb. This satisfies the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

### Conclusion:

Cacua,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, it is evident that standard negation in Cacua can be marked by an affix or modification of the verb. Specifically, the negation suffix -kan/-kap is used to mark negation on verbs. This is clearly illustrated in several examples:

- Paragraph 1: ""Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses to questions. A negative response may involve repeating the predicate in the imperative clause, adding the negation marker -kan as illustrated in (112): B. wã=beh-kan=tʃãhãp 1SG=go-NEG=PROG ‘I am not going’""
- Paragraph 2: ""When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’ is used.""
- Paragraph 7: ""The strategy for negation in nouns differs from that of verbs in that verbal negation is marked with the negation suffix -kan, while the negation of nouns is expressed through existential negation.""
- Paragraph 8: ""Position 7: Suffix: negation Position 7 is filled only with the negation suffix -kan/-kap as illustrated in (33) and (34) below. Example (34) shows how the negation marker occurs after the general past tense suffix that occurs in position 6: 33) kǎn=diʔ wã=pĩ-dɨw-kan=hĩ 3SG=OBJ 1SG=HAB-carry-NEG=REM.PST ‘I never carried him’ 34) ʔã=t-ɲǎk-beʔ-ep-kap-ta=be 3SG.M=EVID-scream-grow-PST-NEG=EVID=REC.PST ‘maybe he didn’t scream’""

These examples demonstrate that the negation suffix -kan/-kap is phonologically bound to the verb, thus fulfilling the criteria for standard negation marking in Cacua.

2. Conclusion: 1",1,1
Yuracare,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that standard negation in Yuracare can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

- Paragraph 1: The examples show the use of ""nish"" or ""nij"" as a negative adverb placed before the verb. For instance, ""nishbobo-ø=w=ya"" (NEG hit;kill-3=PL=NVR) translates to ""They did not kill him then."" This indicates that negation is directly associated with the verb phrase.

- Paragraph 6: The description of negative clauses mentions that ""nish"" or ""nij"" normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates, which confirms that negation is closely tied to the verb.

- Paragraph 10: The example ""nijanti-tewe=la danda-y ku-ta-ø=ya l-achu ku-danda-shta-ø=se"" (NEG DEM 1SG-foot=INS go.up-1SG.S 3SG.CO-say-3=NVR REF-like.that 3SG.CO-go.up-FUT-3=SE) shows the use of ""nij"" as a negation marker directly preceding the verb phrase.

These examples demonstrate that negation in Yuracare is marked by elements that are phonologically bound to the verb, either as a prefix or a clitic.

Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Kuna language, we can determine the method of standard negation in Kuna. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions the use of the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) to negate a verb in a sentence.
   - Examples provided show the suffix attached directly to the verb stem or following an aspect suffix.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - It reiterates the use of the suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul for negating sentences.
   - Examples show the suffix directly attached to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - It mentions that a desiderative action can be negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb.

4. **Paragraph 16**:
   - It describes the negation of adjectives using the suffix -chuli/-zhuli/-juli.

From these points, it is clear that the standard negation in Kuna involves the use of a suffix (-chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)) that is phonologically bound to the verb. This suffix attaches directly to the verb stem or follows an aspect suffix, thus forming a phonological unit with the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. Based on the evidence provided in the paragraphs, standard negation in the language Kuna can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. **Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Uru,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, it is evident that standard negation in Uru can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Specifically, the paragraphs mention the use of the negation particle ""ana"" combined with clitics such as ""-pini"" (affirmative) and ""-cay"" (declarative), which are phonologically bound to the verb. For example, in the sentence ""ana-pini culu xala-m kuna-cu-cay"" (NEG-AFF what lama-CL=2 kill-PST2-DEC), the negation ""ana"" is combined with the clitic ""-pini"" and is bound to the verb phrase. Additionally, the use of ""ana"" with other clitics like ""-kala"" (certainty) further supports the presence of phonologically bound elements in negation constructions.

2. Conclusion: 1",0,1
Camsá,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, it is evident that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. The paragraphs provide several examples of negation involving prefixes that attach directly to the verb, which are indicative of bound morphemes.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of the negator word ""ndoñ"" preceding the verb and mentions the irrealis prefix ""ke-"" and the negative prefix ""at-"". These prefixes are described as attaching to the verb, indicating that they are bound morphemes. Examples such as ""ndoñ ke-s̈-at-amënts̈na"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-tired) and ""ndoñ ki-n-at-apten"" (NEG IRR-EVI-NEG-rain) show that negation involves prefixes that are phonologically bound to the verb.
   - **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides additional examples of negation with the prefix ""at-"" and the irrealis prefix ""ke-"", further supporting the presence of bound morphemes in negation. For instance, ""ndoñ ke-ts-at-abowenyná"" (NEG IRR-1SG-NEG-remember) and ""ndoñ ke-n-at-opasan"" (NEG IRR-EVI-NEG-happen) demonstrate the use of these prefixes in negation.
   - **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the syntax of negation and mentions that negation can be shown by verbal morphology without the negator ""ndoñ"". It also references the use of negative verbal morphology, such as the prefix ""nd-"" in certain tenses, which is homophonous with other prefixes in the language.
   - **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides further examples of negation involving the prefix ""at-"" and the irrealis prefix ""ke-"", reinforcing the pattern of bound morphemes in negation. Examples include ""ndoñ ke-s̈-at-amënts̈na"" and ""ndoñ ki-n-at-apten"".

Given the consistent use of bound prefixes for negation in the examples provided, it is clear that standard negation in Camsá can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion: 1**",1,1
Warao,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, it is evident that standard negation in Warao can be marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb. Specifically, the suffix **-naka** 'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root to indicate negation. This is clearly illustrated in the examples provided in the paragraphs:

- **Paragraph 1**: ""Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG', whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker -naka 'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality overtly.""
- **Example from Paragraph 1**: ""hirima nao-naka ta-te"" (Your father does not come).

These examples demonstrate that the negation marker **-naka** is an affix that attaches directly to the verb root, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation being marked by an affix that is phonologically bound to the verb.

2. **Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Cuiba,"1. Based on the provided paragraphs, it is possible to determine that standard negation in Cuiba can be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb. Here is the reasoning:

- **Paragraph 8** mentions the use of ""VbClit 20 = -yo ‘negative’"" and ""Vb Clit 72 = -ipa ‘conditional’"". This indicates that there are clitics that attach to the verb to mark negation.
- **Paragraph 11** provides examples of negative constructions where ""jopa"" (not) is used in combination with verbs. For instance, ""Neg: jopa S: huaca O): naca P: sinayo"" translates to ""not—the-bird—us—bite-he-not"" (The bird doesn’t bite us). This suggests that ""jopa"" is used as a negation marker, and its placement indicates it could be functioning as a clitic or an affix.
- **Paragraph 21** lists various verb stem affixes and mentions that ""vb s sfx ‘b’ occur with the negative, future, etc."" This implies that there are specific suffixes used for negation in the verb conjugation.

Given these pieces of evidence, it is clear that Cuiba uses affixes or clitics that are phonologically bound to the verb to mark standard negation.

Conclusion: 1",1,1
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Apurinã by examining the relevant information about negation markers and their attachment to verbs.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - **Morphological Negation**: The negative attributive marker ""m(a)-"" is used to form negative verbs, as seen in the example ""m-areka-kati-nhi"" (NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT).
   - **Periphrastic Negation**: The particle ""kona"" is used for negation and can precede or follow pre-verbal constituents, as in ""nota kona sa-ru"" (1SG not go-3M.O) and ""kona nota sa-ru"" (not 1SG go-3M.O).

2. **Paragraph 8**:
   - **Shortened Forms of Negation**: The particle ""kona"" can be shortened to ""a"" or ""n"" before consonant-initial or vowel-initial words, respectively, as in ""a#n-ayata-panhi"" (NEG#hunt-IMPFTV).

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - **Privative Reversal Marker**: The marker ""wẽ-"" reverses the negative meaning of descriptive verbs, as in ""ma-wẽ-ere-tu"" (PRIV-REV-be.pretty-3M.O).

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - **Negative Attributive Markers**: The markers ""m(a)-"" and ""-tu/-to"" indicate that the subject lacks the property of the verb, as in ""m-areka"" (NEG-be.good).

From the above information, it is clear that Apurinã uses morphological negation markers that attach to verbs, such as ""m(a)-"" and ""-tu/-to"". These markers are affixes that modify the verb to indicate negation. Additionally, the particle ""kona"" is used for periphrastic negation, but the presence of morphological negation markers confirms that negation can be marked by affixes or modifications of the verb.

### Conclusion:
1. **Conclusion**: 1",1,1
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Kadiwéu.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions a negative marker ""nG+"" attached to imperative and conditional clauses, indicating a combined negation/mood marker.
2. **Paragraph 2** states that in Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs), only the first verb can be modified by a negative morpheme, implying that negation can be marked directly on the verb.
3. **Paragraph 8** summarizes that the verb structure in Kadiwéu encodes negation among other grammatical features.
4. **Paragraph 25** provides explicit examples of negation markers in Kadiwéu:
   - The proclitic ""+aG"" attaches to the verb of the main clause.
   - The negator ""daGa~+"" attaches to the left of a complementizer for subordinate clauses.
   - Both ""+aG"" and ""daGa~+"" can be used together to negate both main and subordinate clauses.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Kadiwéu uses proclitics (e.g., ""+aG"") that attach to the verb to mark negation. This indicates that standard negation in Kadiwéu can indeed be marked by an affix, clitic, or modification of the verb.

**Conclusion:** 1",1,1
Karajá,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the method of standard negation in Karajá. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates the entire sentence.""
   - ""The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfective clitic, can also be used in such circumstances.""
   - ""An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ), occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation.""

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""A common type of negative imperative is formed with an action noun followed by the postposition èb´) and, optionally, either the future marker èkre or the potential marker èkE.""
   - Examples provided show the use of the negative morpheme -ko) in imperative constructions.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (82) shows the use of the negative morpheme in a sentence: ""i-Oha)ruèr-eèdori 1-CTFG-INTR-go=NEG=FUT 3-danger=CTFG-IMPERF=dori"" which translates to ""I won’t go, because it is dangerous.""

From these points, it is clear that the standard negation in Karajá can be marked by an affix (-ko)) that is phonologically bound to the verb. This affix directly attaches to the verb to negate the sentence, fulfilling the criteria for standard negation as defined in the guidelines.
