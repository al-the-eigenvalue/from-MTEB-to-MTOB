Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Supyire by examining the structure of declarative sentences, particularly those involving both subject (S) and object (O) participants as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It states that the basic word order in simple clauses is subject—predicate.
   - Example: ""Mi) wl"" ('I it.is') translates to 'It's me.' This example, although not transitive, shows the subject preceding the predicate.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It mentions that the Senufo languages, including Supyire, have a word order similar to Mande languages, with the direct object placed before the verb.
   - This suggests an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Reiterates that the direct object precedes the verb in Supyire, aligning with the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Provides detailed examples of verbal clauses:
     - Example (4a): ""U akärd sig6 e."" ('She PERF go bush.DEF to') translates to 'She went to the bush.'
     - Example (5): ""Unmha suro shwo ho."" ('She HAB mush cook') translates to 'She cooks mush.'
   - These examples show the subject (U) preceding the auxiliary (akärd, nmha), followed by the object (sig6, suro), and then the verb (e, shwo).

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Confirms that subjects and direct objects are easily distinguishable by their fixed positions in the sentence, with the subject preceding the object and the object preceding the verb.

6. **Paragraph 21**:
   - Discusses the passive construction, indicating that intransitive clauses with a patient subject and a normally transitive verb must be passive, reinforcing the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Ma'di,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can deduce the dominant word order in Ma'di by examining the syntactic structures and explicit statements about word order in different dialects of Ma'di.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph explicitly states that the 'Burulo dialect' of Ma'di has an SVO word order, while the Lokai dialect is partly SVO and partly SOV.
   - This suggests that SVO is a dominant or at least a significant word order in Ma'di, especially in the 'Burulo dialect'.

2. **Paragraph 14**:
   - This paragraph mentions that in the 'Burulo dialect', the word order is verb-object when the verb is inflected (nonpast). This indicates that in certain contexts, the verb precedes the object, which aligns with an SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 20**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of sentences with inflected verbs where the object precedes the verb, which is indicative of an SVO structure. For example, ""ká gbándá pä"" translates to ""He is eating cassava,"" where the subject (he) precedes the object (cassava), and the verb (eating) follows the object.

4. **Paragraph 23**:
   - This paragraph shows an example where the subject precedes the object and the verb, which is consistent with an SVO structure: ""ma eßl para"" translates to ""I will certainly eat fish,"" where the subject (I) precedes the object (fish), and the verb (eat) follows the object.

5. **Paragraph 24**:
   - This paragraph discusses the positioning of objects and subjects in relation to the verb, indicating that the object can precede the verb in certain focused structures, but this does not contradict the general SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 39**:
   - This paragraph mentions that in the 'Burulo dialect', the object never precedes the inflected verb, which supports the SVO structure.

7. **Paragraph 49**:
   - This paragraph discusses the coding of tense rather than aspect and provides examples that align with an SVO structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ma'di, particularly in the 'Burulo dialect', is SVO.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Bangime,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, the dominant word order in the language can be determined by examining the default word orders for different tenses, aspects, and moods. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph states that the attested word orders in Bangime are SVO, SOV, and OSV for untopicalized sentences. Specifically:
   - Incompletive aspects are usually SVO.
   - Completive aspects are SOV.
   - Future tense can be expressed with OSV word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reiterates that incompletive categories are usually SOV, completed categories are SVO, and the future tense may be either SOV or OSV. It also mentions that some verbs may deviate from the default word order to indicate topicalization.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of word order in different tenses:
   - Incompletive aspect: SOV (e.g., ""n dáá kéndɛ̀ kéɛ̀ m póɣɔ̀"" - ""I am stepping on a snake"").
   - Completive aspect: SVO (e.g., ""kɔ́ó m póɣɔ̀ kɛ́ndɛ̀ kɛ́è"" - ""I stepped on a snake"").

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph confirms that the default word order for the completive aspect is SVO.

5. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph states that the incompletive aspects follow the word order SOV, except the future, which may have an OSV word order.

6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides an example of the incompletive aspect with an object, showing the default word order as SOV (e.g., ""n dá dóɔ̀ n ɲɔ̀ɡɔ̀ndó"" - ""He is writing a book"").

7. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph confirms that the completive aspect has SVO word order.

8. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph states that the incompletive aspect utilizes the incompletive particle, and the verb is phrase-final, indicating SOV word order.

9. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph discusses the future tense, indicating that if an object is included, the future tense is formed with the object first, followed by the incompletive particle and the verb, resulting in OSV word order.

10. **Paragraph 29**: This paragraph confirms that the future tense can be formed with OSV word order.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Bangime exhibits different word orders depending on the tense, aspect, and mood of the sentence. However, the most frequently mentioned and default word orders are SVO for completive aspects and SOV for incompletive aspects. Given the variability and the lack of a single dominant word order across all contexts, the appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Gumuz by examining the examples of transitive sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is finite. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (10.71): ""dua d-a-lígít tʃogwá-arabía"" (child AFF-3SG.TR-roll foot-Arab) translates to ""The child rolled the tire (‘Arab foot’)."" This shows an SVO order.
   - Example (10.72): ""dogwaaŋá b-a-sa-gá gazíá"" (donkey AFF-3SG.TR-eat-NFUT grass) translates to ""The donkey ate the grass."" This also shows an SVO order.
   - Example (10.73): ""áχó sáŋâ d-a-gam"" (3SG salt AFF-3SG.TR-find) translates to ""He found salt."" This shows an SOV order.
   - Example (10.74): ""ŋ́gafa duu-má b-a-fag-agá-kʼw"" (woman child-3SG.POSS AFF-3SG.TR-rise-NFUT-HEAD) translates to ""The woman raised her child."" This shows an SOV order.
   - Example (10.75): ""mátsʼá d-a-sá-kʼʷ á-manɟa"" (house AFF-3SG.TR-eat-CL1:HEAD NOM-fire) translates to ""The fire consumed the house."" This shows an OVS order.
   - Example (10.76): ""ɟá b-a-tsʼii-gá-kʼw á-ziba"" (tree AFF-3SG.TR-break-NFUT-HEAD NOM-wind) translates to ""The wind broke the tree."" This shows an OVS order.
   - Example (10.77): ""d-a-ŋar-ákʼw=gwê á-mááχó duú-ma"" (AFF-3SG.TR-CL1:HEAD=CONJ NOM-3PL child-1SG.POSS) translates to ""And he took my child."" This shows a VSO order.

2. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (12.50a): ""ɓaga d-a-ɓátʃ ŋ́gafa"" (person AFF-3SG.TR-hit woman) translates to ""The person hit the woman."" This shows an SVO order.
   - Example (12.50b): ""ɓaga l-á-ɓátʃ ŋ́gafa"" (person REL-3SG.TR-hit woman) translates to ""The person that hit the woman is here."" This shows an SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Example (12.51): ""kʼwatʼa l-á-ɓátʃ-a óó-báámítá=tso"" (chair AFF-3SG.TR:A.REL-hit-A:EXT.H M-Bamita=FOC) translates to ""The one who hit the chair is Bamita."" This shows an OVS order.

4. **Paragraph 46**:
   - Example (12.68): ""etá-l-á-n̩-ʃá-á-cá mambráátá=tso"" (REL.PRO-REL-3SG-PL-die-MV-CL1:eye light=FOC) translates to ""What went out (repeatedly) was the light."" This shows an SVO order.
   - Example (12.70): ""etá-l-á-ɗú-áá-tsa óó-báámítá"" (REL.PRO-REL-3SG-be.sick-MV-BODY M-Bamita) translates to ""The one who is sick is Bamita."" This shows an SVO order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the examples provided, the word order in Gumuz shows variability with instances of SVO, SOV, OVS, and VSO. However, the most frequently occurring order in the examples is SVO. Therefore, the dominant word order in Gumuz is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

To determine the dominant word order in Koyra Chiini, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any explicit or implicit information about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Koyra Chiini shows ""S-MAN-V-X constituent order (subject, mood-aspect-negation, verb, other elements including direct object)."" This suggests that the subject comes first, followed by mood-aspect-negation markers, then the verb, and finally other elements including the direct object. This implies an SVO structure.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states, ""The basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object),"" and provides examples that follow this pattern:
   - Example (6): ""[bar di} ο guna [woy di] doodi"" translates to ""The man sees the woman there,"" which follows the SVO order.
   - Example (7): ""a guna ni doodi"" translates to ""He (She) saw you(Sg) there,"" which also follows the SVO order.
   - Example (8): ""ay na guna [[huu di] kuna] [boro foo]"" translates to ""I didn't see anyone in the house,"" again following the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 4** states, ""The distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order. Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct objects and PPs."" This reinforces the SVO structure.

4. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of subject and object pronouns in sentences that follow the SVO order:
   - Example (59a): ""ay kar gi"" translates to ""I hit them.""
   - Example (59b): ""a kar ey"" translates to ""She hit me.""
   - Example (59c): ""i kar ga"" translates to ""They hit him.""

5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss the ordering of postverbal constituents and pronominal cliticization, which indirectly supports the SVO structure by showing that objects follow verbs.

6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss the ordering of postverbal constituents and verb-verb compounds, which are consistent with an SVO structure.

7. **Paragraph 13** mentions that the direct object is often omitted as in English, which implies that when it is present, it follows the verb, supporting the SVO structure.

8. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss the ordering of possessors and other elements within noun phrases, which is not directly relevant to the SVO structure but does not contradict it.

9. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss conjunctions and other syntactic structures that do not contradict the SVO order.

10. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss anaphora and reported speech, which are not directly relevant to determining the basic word order but do not contradict the SVO structure.

11. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 21** discuss the use of particles and logophoric pronouns, which do not contradict the SVO structure.

12. **Paragraph 22** and **Paragraph 23** discuss adjective sequences and result clauses, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order but do not contradict the SVO structure.

13. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** discuss focus constructions and infinitival VPs, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

14. **Paragraph 26** and **Paragraph 27** discuss serial verbs and infinitival VPs, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

15. **Paragraph 28** and **Paragraph 29** discuss conjunctions and pronominal forms, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

16. **Paragraph 30** and **Paragraph 31** discuss derived voice forms and zero derivation, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

17. **Paragraph 32** and **Paragraph 33** discuss equational sentences and typical sentence structures, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

18. **Paragraph 34** and **Paragraph 35** discuss the ordering of postverbal constituents and the use of moo, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

19. **Paragraph 36** and **Paragraph 37** discuss kinship terms and verb derivation, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order but do not contradict the SVO structure.

20. **Paragraph 38** and **Paragraph 39** discuss verb derivation and postverbal constituents, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

21. **Paragraph 40** and **Paragraph 41** discuss diphthongs and apheresis, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order but do not contradict the SVO structure.

22. **Paragraph 42** and **Paragraph 43** discuss the use of 'whatchamacallit?' and focus markers, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

23. **Paragraph 44** and **Paragraph 45** discuss transcription conventions and focus constructions, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

24. **Paragraph 46** and **Paragraph 47** discuss locative postpositions and discourse-functional morphemes, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

25. **Paragraph 48** and **Paragraph 49** discuss upriver dialects and spatiotemporal structures, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

26. **Paragraph 50** discusses reflexive pronouns, which are consistent with the SVO structure.

!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and statements about the typical sentence structures.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""While the basic word order is SVO, there is a second word order structure in all dialects, namely SOV, when specific matrix verbs taking either nominal or verbal complements are involved...""
   - This indicates that SVO is considered the basic word order, with SOV appearing in specific contexts.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""As table 7-1 shows, the basic word order is subject—verb—object (SVO), irrespective of whether pronominal or nominal participants are involved...""
   - This reinforces the idea that SVO is the basic word order.

3. **Paragraph 8**:
   - ""(c) The basic word order is head—dependent and subject-verb—object, although there is a minor ae exhibiting dependent—head and object-verb word order...""
   - Again, SVO is highlighted as the basic word order, with some variations.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""What is common to all dialects is that TAM (tense—aspect—modality) markers and negation are placed between subject and verb, that the object follows the verb...""
   - This supports the SVO structure, where the object follows the verb.

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""...the subject (a pronoun) precedes the verb while the object follows it...""
   - This is another confirmation of the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 22**:
   - ""In all dialects it is possible to exchange the order of post-verbal participants, of both arguments and adjuncts...""
   - While this indicates some flexibility, it does not contradict the basic SVO order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in !Xun (Ekoka) is **SVO**.

### Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Katcha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Katcha can be determined by examining the syntactic structure and the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Katcha basic word order is either SVO or VSO."" This indicates that the language predominantly uses either Subject-Verb-Object or Verb-Subject-Object order.

2. **Paragraph 6** provides an example sentence: ""ataꞌdara maogo kussudene[kaataɗara ma sɔkɔ k-ʊssʊ-t nkawisdom ofGod 3p-know-passloc people alltannoamma kata-nɔamːakakatʊnyeꞌdꞌde kungngoɲeɗɗetumma tanno tʊmːanon.core-3p.rel accept loc words nokaduta-nɔk-ʊŋːɔ3p-be.present a aogosɔkɔnon.core-3p.rel instr God]no 3p.rel ‘God’s wisdom is shown to be true by all who accept it.’"" Here, the verb ""kussudene"" (know) follows the subject ""ataꞌdara maogo"" (God's wisdom), suggesting an SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 19** provides examples of relative clauses, which show the verb following the subject: ""miːte [j-akʊ́ oxɔ́ːjɔ́já] amaːlarel.m-eat grass rel.m 3m.be.brown‘The ox which is eating grass is brown’."" This again suggests an SVO structure.

4. **Paragraph 27** gives examples of passive constructions: ""kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́ food 3m-cook-pass ‘the food is being cooked’."" Here, the verb ""ʊnɪ-t"" (cook) follows the subject ""kʊrɪ"" (food), indicating an SVO structure.

5. **Paragraph 35** provides another example: ""kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-tené food cook-pass ‘some food is being cooked’."" This also follows the SVO pattern.

6. **Paragraph 43** discusses applicative constructions: ""akkám-ʊnɪ-tákʊ́rɪ akʊ́kkʊwoman 3f-cook-appl food ben Kuku ‘the woman is cooking food for Kuku’."" Here, the verb ""ʊnɪ-tá"" (cook) follows the subject ""akkám"" (woman), again suggesting an SVO structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Katcha is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object).

**Conclusion:** SVO",no dominant order,svo
Ijo (Kolokuma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Ijo (Kolokuma) by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""In word-order, modifiers consistently precede heads and the object precedes the verb.""
   - This indicates an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure since the object precedes the verb.

2. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples of passive constructions:
     - ""igere, ere-ma kQri-mi"" (crocodile woman T catch Spa) translates to ""a crocodile caught the woman.""
     - ""er6-ma, iger6, kori-mi"" (woman T crocodile catch Spa) translates to ""the woman was caught by a crocodile.""
   - The active sentence structure ""crocodile woman catch"" (SOV) supports the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Examples of verb combinations:
     - ""eri, weni-da, ami syp-mi"" (he walk and town enter Spa) translates to ""he walked and then entered a town.""
   - This shows the verb-final nature of the language, consistent with SOV.

4. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Examples of interrogative sentences:
     - ""eri, am&so?-mi"" (he town enter Spa) translates to ""who went to town?""
     - ""eri, wo bina 6wei-mp, b6-mi"" (he his relative man with come Spa) translates to ""who did he come with?""
   - The structure ""he town enter"" (SOV) and ""he his relative man with come"" (SOV) further supports the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 28**:
   - Examples of nominalized sentences:
     - ""arj, in6 bo-yemi tu-bi nimi-w6nimi"" (I your come SPr reason T know StPr) translates to ""I know your reason for coming.""
   - The structure ""I your come reason know"" (SOV) aligns with the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Emai can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).""
   - Example: ""ólí ómòhè é ólí émàè."" (the man PRP.eat the food) translates to ""The man has eaten the food.""

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ngiti can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the Perfective Present in Ngiti has an SVO word order. It also mentions that in the Present Continuous, the word order changes to SAuxOV (NOM), indicating some flexibility depending on tense and aspect.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph supports the information in Paragraph 1 by stating that both SVO and S(Aux)OV word orders are attested in Ngiti, with the distribution dependent on the verb tense or aspect used.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in the Perfective Present, showing the SVO word order in action. For instance, ""the child has cried"" and ""he will plant a banana"" follow the SVO structure.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order with numerals and other quantifiers, indicating that while there is some flexibility, the unmarked order (least emphasis) is numeral-noun, which aligns with the SVO structure in declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph mentions nominalisation processes and how they can function in subject or object slots within a sentence, which indirectly supports the SVO structure by showing how different elements can fit into the subject and object positions.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the Present Continuous tense and provides examples of transitive verbs in this tense, showing the SAuxOV structure, which is a variation of the basic SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 45**: This paragraph explains that subject and object pronouns can be cliticised to the verb stem, which is common in SVO languages where pronouns often attach to verbs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ngiti is **SVO**. This is supported by explicit statements in the grammar and examples of sentences in the Perfective Present tense, which consistently follow the SVO structure.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the word order is predominantly SOV when the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words. This is a clear indication of the dominant word order in Sidaama.
2. **Paragraph 5** reinforces this by stating that the basic word order in Sidaama is SOV.
3. **Paragraph 15** mentions that the positions of adverbials modifying the same verb in a clause are basically free, though they cannot intervene between components of a constituent and none of them can occur clause-finally. This suggests that the verb typically appears at the end of the clause, consistent with SOV order.
4. **Paragraph 24** describes the intonation patterns in declarative sentences, which typically end in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phrase clitic. This further supports the verb-final structure.
5. **Paragraph 38** discusses the order of other types of constituents, indicating that the verb follows the main verbs, again supporting a verb-final structure.

Given these consistent indications across multiple paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Sidaama is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov

### Conclusion: SVO

The dominant word order in Mursi is **SVO**.",svo,svo
Majang,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a clear example of the basic constituent order in Majang, which is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). It mentions that this order is frequently observed when eliciting transitive clauses and gives examples to support this claim. However, it also notes that in natural texts, this order is not the most frequent.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the VSO order by mentioning that deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders did not produce variants, and that VSO has a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides another example of VSO order in a subordinate clause, further supporting the claim that VSO is a recognized structure in Majang.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph states that the basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VSO, and that the order is fairly fixed except for pragmatic reasons.

5. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph mentions that the default clause structure of Majang is VP or VS, depending on transitivity, which aligns with the VSO order.

6. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph establishes the order of constituents for the nuclear clause as verb – (S/A) – object (P) – complement, which supports the VSO order.

7. **Paragraph 28**: This paragraph mentions that the canonical order of constituents in Majang is VSO, further supporting the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Majang is **VSO**.

**Conclusion:** VSO",vso,vso
Birri,"### Reasoning:

To determine the dominant word order in Birri, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for patterns in the arrangement of subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key observations from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - Example: ""umd-db awii akpasha"" (this man runs much).
   - Example: ""umd-db akpa-dd"" (the man is good).
   - Example: ""umd-db akpa-dd, pl. umd-db mugu akpa-ne da"" (the man is good, the men are good).

   These examples show a pattern of Subject-Verb (SV) and Subject-Adjective (SA), but no clear indication of object placement.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example: ""I shall come mayi g-and.""
   - Example: ""He will come just now ayi g-dnd 6e6e-db.""
   - Example: ""They will come to-morrow ayine g-dnd amundri.""

   These examples show a pattern of Subject-Verb (SV) in future tense constructions, but again, no clear indication of object placement.

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""object + verb stem: viz. the 'reversed' construction, if compared to the Sudanic languages of this area (Bongo-Kresh and Ndogo-Feroge groups).""
   - Example: ""To steal ide g-dgi. To eat ide g-onyo. To dig (a) hole vu g-d-di.""

   This paragraph explicitly mentions the ""reversed"" construction, indicating that the object precedes the verb (OV). However, it does not provide a full sentence with a subject.

4. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example: ""Beat the child me yoo-ngu.""
   - Example: ""Count all the people u^rd ulu (a)fe.""

   These examples show a pattern of Verb-Object (VO) but do not include subjects.

5. **Paragraph 22**:
   - Example: ""verb stem + object or any specification. If there is none: —""
   - Example: ""verb stem -|- 'thing' (ede = de = idi = di), or no = no, or (seldom) both.""

   This paragraph discusses imperative constructions, which typically do not include subjects.

6. **Paragraph 29**:
   - Example: ""He said: He will (or would) not come ayi-ka: na-ye ga g-and cd; pl. ayini-ka: nd-ye-gd-ne g-and cd.""
   - Example: ""He is walking ir-amvd. What are you doing? mu re (pr. muru) wa (a)dhe?""

   These examples show Subject-Verb (SV) patterns but do not include objects.

7. **Paragraph 30**:
   - Example: ""The hut burnt dhara dyo-dd.""
   - Example: ""My mother died ydmd ayi-dd.""
   - Example: ""He married (a woman) adi iju-da.""

   These examples show Subject-Verb (SV) patterns but do not include objects.

8. **Paragraph 31**:
   - Example: ""He came to catch me, thee, him; us, you, them.""
   - Example: ""Catch him! onvu fe! Catch them! onvu tene!""

   These examples show Verb-Object (VO) patterns but do not include subjects.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, there is no consistent pattern that clearly indicates a dominant word order involving subjects, objects, and verbs in declarative sentences with both noun subjects and objects. The examples provided either lack one of the necessary components (subject, object, or verb) or do not show a consistent pattern across different contexts.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Tamashek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can infer the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""The tent [topic], water surrounds (=is abundant around) it.""
     - Structure: Subject (water) - Verb (surrounds) - Object (it)
   - Example: ""The small dune [topic], fodder (=grass) surrounds it.""
     - Structure: Subject (fodder) - Verb (surrounds) - Object (it)

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example: ""The midget returned his greeting.""
     - Structure: Subject (The midget) - Verb (returned) - Object (his greeting)
   - Example: ""The lying man asked him about his (=midget's) father.""
     - Structure: Subject (The lying man) - Verb (asked) - Object (him)

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""The time will come when lying down (=sleeping in the daytime) will no longer be possible for you-FeSg.""
     - Structure: Subject (The time) - Verb (will come) - Object (when lying down will no longer be possible for you-FeSg)

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example: ""He prevented him from going to Bamako.""
     - Structure: Subject (He) - Verb (prevented) - Object (him)
   - Example: ""He got (and brought) money, in order that I build.""
     - Structure: Subject (He) - Verb (got) - Object (money)

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - No clear SVO structure examples provided.

From the examples provided, it is evident that the dominant word order in Tamashek is **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**. This is consistently observed in sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

### Conclusion:
SVO",vso,svo
Coptic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Coptic, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""S-V-O order can be established as the basic word order on syntactic grounds."" It further explains that Coptic is a head-initial language where the verb precedes the direct and indirect objects, and the subject precedes the direct object. This is supported by examples such as ""a oycon xne ama Capamion"" ('a brother asked Apa Sarapion').

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that Sahidic Coptic permits several arrangements of the main constituents (S, V, O) due to its relatively flexible word order. However, it also states that ""S~V-O order can be identified as the basic word order"" in pragmatically neutral contexts. The paragraph also discusses the presence of verb-initial sentences (V-S and V-S-O) but notes these are restricted to specific verb classes and are not the general rule.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reiterates that ""S-V-O order can be established as the basic word order on syntactic grounds"" and provides examples to support this claim. It emphasizes that S-V-O reflects the basic structural relations between the verb and its arguments.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph supports the claim that ""S-V-O is the basic word order of Sahidic Coptic from which other word order patterns are derived.""

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses subject inversion and mentions that the basic word order is S-V-O, with examples provided to illustrate this structure.

6. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides further examples of S-V-O order in pragmatically neutral contexts, reinforcing the claim that this is the basic word order.

7. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph discusses subject inversion as an information-packaging construction, indicating that the basic order is S-V-O, with the inverted order being a marked option.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in Coptic is SVO, as consistently indicated by multiple paragraphs in the descriptive grammar.",svo,svo
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Igbo can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the structure of the verb phrase (VP) in Igbo, emphasizing that the verb is the head of the VP and governs its constituents, including the direct object and indirect object. This suggests that the verb plays a central role in sentence structure.

2. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of transitive verbs and their objects, such as ""-gbu ‘kill’"" and ""ewu ‘goat’"". The structure of these sentences implies that the verb precedes the object, indicating a potential SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: Contains an example sentence ""O dèrè akwukwo ya etu kwesiri ekwesi"" (He wrote his book as expected), which follows the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses verbs that change meaning when used with objects and provides examples like ""Nryòn (AT Nrònó) ínû"" (I am wise (intelligent)). The structure of these sentences also follows the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions that Igbo exhibits some features of ergativity but does not provide specific examples that contradict the SVO order observed in other paragraphs.

6. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses semantic roles and sentence meaning, noting that nouns or noun phrases found before a verb may have grammatical functions as subject, object, or indirect object. This aligns with the SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 23**: Discusses argument structure and provides examples of intransitive and transitive verbs, reinforcing the SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 36**: Provides a schematic structure of the sentence in Igbo, showing the order as NP (subject) - VP (verb phrase) - NP (object), which aligns with the SVO order.

9. **Paragraph 38**: Discusses the arguments for transitivity in Igbo and provides examples that follow the SVO order.

10. **Paragraph 44**: Provides examples of complex verbs and their complements, which also follow the SVO order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Mambai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, the dominant word order in Mambai can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** provides the most direct evidence regarding the constituent order in Mambai. It explicitly states that the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly SVO (subject–verb–object). This is illustrated with examples such as:
   - ""tí4gérêm %á%4zí túrà"" (The women sowed millet), where ""tí4gérêm"" (the women) is the subject (S), ""%á%4zí"" (sowed) is the verb (V), and ""túrà"" (millet) is the object (O).
   - Another example: ""mìí yáh pìzá"" (I will take the horse), where ""mìí"" (I) is the subject (S), ""yáh"" (take) is the verb (V), and ""pìzá"" (horse) is the object (O).

2. **Paragraph 2** does not provide specific examples of constituent order but discusses the structure of the grammar and transitions between chapters.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses subjunctive constructions and optative verb forms but does not provide direct information about the basic word order.

4. **Paragraph 4** outlines the aspects of clause structure, including constituent order, but does not provide specific examples or details beyond what is given in Paragraph 1.

5. **Paragraph 5** and subsequent paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, including ideophones, pronouns, and other grammatical features, but do not provide additional direct evidence regarding the basic word order.

Given the explicit statement and examples in Paragraph 1, it is clear that the dominant word order in Mambai is SVO.

### Conclusion:

Gorowa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gorowa, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the examples and explanations given.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph explicitly states: ""Basic constituent order in pragmatically neutral clauses is Subj. Obj. Sel V,"" where Subj. = Subject, Obj. = Object, Sel = Selector, and V = Verb.
   - Example: ""garmaSUBJ baahaaOBJ nginaSEL taáhhV"" translates to ""The boy hit the hyaena.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in Gorowa but mentions that ""SOV word order is common enough to be considered canonical.""
   - Example: ""aní slee ana taáhh"" translates to ""I beat the cow.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Reiterates the canonical SOV word order with an example: ""aní slee ana taáhh"" translating to ""I beat the cow.""

4. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Provides an example of OSV word order: ""desirqá' kuúng an sla'"" translating to ""You love that girl.""

5. **Paragraph 22**:

Shatt,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Shatt language, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The example sentence ""Nya abisoloni nuxung sadogäng täging"" shows the object ""abisoloni"" (sorghum) before the verb ""sadogäng"" (they give), indicating an SOV structure.

2. **Paragraph 14**: The example sentence ""Kig kasiy ya"" translates to ""Person ate meat,"" where ""kig"" (person) is the subject, ""ya"" (meat) is the object, and ""kasiy"" (ate) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 8**: The sentence ""Na kala apoco kox Nyaxolow poko päxä deny"" translates to ""Then Hare saw Hyena carrying the calf,"" where ""Nyaxolow"" (Hyena) is the subject, ""päxä deny"" (the calf) is the object, and ""poko"" (carrying) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 37**: The sentence ""Na kala todi kig äxse säpoko säꞌdocco sädogada täzä telegu"" translates to ""Then a person died and they carried (him) and went and put (him) over shelter,"" where ""kig"" (person) is the subject, ""äxse"" (died) is the verb, and ""sädogada"" (put) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 33**: The sentence ""Kig kasax op"" translates to ""Person refused the young man,"" where ""kig"" (person) is the subject, ""op"" (young man) is the object, and ""kasax"" (refused) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 22**: The sentence ""Kig kasax op"" translates to ""Person refused young man,"" where ""kig"" (person) is the subject, ""op"" (young man) is the object, and ""kasax"" (refused) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

7. **Paragraph 30**: The sentence ""Kig kasax op"" translates to ""Person refused young man,"" where ""kig"" (person) is the subject, ""op"" (young man) is the object, and ""kasax"" (refused) is the verb, indicating an SOV structure.

From these examples, it is clear that the dominant word order in Shatt is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can deduce the dominant word order as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions that the direct object NP is positioned after the verb.
2. **Paragraph 2**: States that in a simple non-emphasized sentence, the subject NP precedes the verb and the object NPs follow the verb.
3. **Paragraph 6**: Provides an example where the verb precedes both the direct and indirect objects.
4. **Paragraph 7**: States that the subject NP is positioned before the verb for both intransitive and transitive verbs.
5. **Paragraph 8**: Shows that the order of the constituents 'woman' and 'millet' is free, but the verb still precedes the objects.
6. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions that the indirect object NP is positioned after the verb.
7. **Paragraph 16**: Describes the order of constituents as NP-COPULA-ADVERBIAL, indicating that the subject precedes the verb.
8. **Paragraph 33**: Indicates that the indirect object comes first if both object NPs are non-pronominal, but still follows the verb.

From these observations, it is clear that the typical structure in Koromfe is for the subject to precede the verb and for the verb to precede the object. This aligns with the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order.

### Conclusion:

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 10** provides several examples of declarative sentences with both subjects and objects as nouns:
   - ""gil ... doso ka tam"" (the dog is eating food)
   - ""kwedile ka f'idsij"" (the salt is finished)
   - ""E J:a -/ldi, .the people are dancing""
   - ""a gilo a wen"" (I see a dog)
   - ""a lli>u twil"" (I am drinking water)
   - ""kwonn ls\""1S"" (cook the meat)
   - ""en a eloo twen"" (he is bringing milk)
   - ""sn a miro ka tushe"" (she has lit the fire)
   - ""wadaI,J timi:l:.o. tows"" (the man is making a wattle door)

   These examples consistently show the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions the placement of particles in relation to the verb and subject, which indirectly supports the SVO structure:
   - ""When a direct object is present, the particle is placed in front of the verb; in other cases, after the subject.""
   - ""When a compound verb (formed with a noun + 'to do') is present, it often appears twice - after the subject, and before the auxiliary.""

   This suggests that the subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb, aligning with an SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 23** provides further examples of sentences:
   - ""bar nyala ne"" (there is one cow)
   - ""bar arba nen"" (there are two cows)
   - ""bar asa nedi"" (there are three cows)
   - ""a bar a wen"" (I see a cow)
   - ""a bar a wenden"" (I see two cows)
   - ""a bar a wendi"" (I see cows)

   These examples also support the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 46** discusses the inflection of verbs and provides examples:
   - ""nyi a tamin"" (I am eating)
   - ""aIJi a tamid~"" (You (two) are eating)
   - ""nyi a tamidi"" (You (many) are eating)
   - ""ani a tamidi"" (They (many) are eating)

   While these examples focus on intransitive verbs, the structure still aligns with the subject preceding the verb.

Given the consistent evidence across multiple paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nyimang appears to be Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

**Conclusion:** SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Lamé,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is finite.

1. **Subject Position**:
   - The subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and verb (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""dʒwə fáŋ ʔya ɮé"" (the chief left again) - S V
     - ""ndʒɪn màn ɮɛ́ si"" (My story starts right now) - S V
     - ""ndór ndóʔ si"" (the rainy season has ended) - S V

2. **Object Position**:
   - The nominal direct object is indicated by the position immediately after the verb regardless of the tense, aspect, or mood of the clause (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""namba záʔ ʒyè ɓáyrúm"" (We found a lot of peanuts) - S V O
     - ""na də̀ tʃe sum myenʔ/gur ye"" (I will drink beer slowly/at long last) - S V O
     - ""tá wə́ gi tsoɓ súm fə̀tà lúmò"" (she sells beer on the day of the market) - S V O

3. **Intervening Elements**:
   - Various elements such as tense/aspect markers, negation markers, and adverbials can intervene between the subject and the verb or between the verb and the object, but the basic order remains SVO.
   - Examples:
     - ""ta də̀ də̀ lúmò"" (she will go to the market) - S T/A V O
     - ""ta wə́ də̀ lúmò"" (she is going to the market) - S T/A V O
     - ""Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə bə̀kà mì"" (Tau didn’t go to the market this morning) - S NEG V O

4. **Summary of Coding Grammatical Roles**:
   - In a perfective or non-perfective clause with only a subject and a nominal direct object, the object noun immediately follows the verb (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""na tsóɓ vú kúm-ú"" (I bought salt yesterday) - S V O
     - ""ta də̀ ti siw-i"" (she will eat it tomorrow) - S T/A V O

### Conclusion: SVO

The dominant word order in Lamé is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object). This conclusion is based on the consistent placement of the subject before the verb and the object immediately following the verb in declarative sentences.",svo,svo
Bininj Gun-Wok,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, the word order in Bininj Gun-Wok appears to be quite flexible, with multiple possible orders being grammatically correct. However, there are some tendencies and common patterns that can be identified.

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that all orderings are grammatically possible and that there is no evidence that particular orders are used to disambiguate. It also states that the commonest orders in transitive clauses with one external nominal group are OV (24 instances), SV (8 instances), and VO (7 instances).
- **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences with different word orders, including SV, OV, and VO.
- **Paragraph 3** discusses the importance of word order in the organization of discourse but does not provide a definitive dominant order.
- **Paragraph 4** mentions that the verb is morphologically complex and that much of what is accomplished by syntax in other languages is carried out within the verb in Bininj Gun-Wok.
- **Paragraph 5** provides examples of different word orders in transitive clauses, including SOV, SVO, OVS, OSV, VSO, and VOS.
- **Paragraph 6** discusses the structure of the verbal word and the complexity of verbal morphology.
- **Paragraph 7** discusses pronominal prefixes and their use in the language.
- **Paragraph 8** discusses the use of the verb ""karrme"" and its unique properties.
- **Paragraph 9** discusses the structure of idioms and the incorporation of nouns.
- **Paragraph 10** discusses the use of commonly used words and their combinations.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Bininj Gun-Wok does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, with multiple orders being used depending on the context and discourse needs.

2. **Conclusion:**
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wambaya,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 3 (Chapter 7 Syntax of Simple Sentences)**:
   - It mentions that Wambaya has two basic clause types: verbal and nominal (or verbless).
   - For verbal clauses, the presence of the auxiliary is required.
   - Word order in verbless clauses is relatively free, with the subject able to precede or follow the predicate, or be discontinuous.

2. **Paragraph 4 (Chapter 1 The Language and Its Speakers)**:
   - It states that Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and the word order is relatively free, which is common for Australian languages.

3. **Paragraph 10 (Chapter 3 Parts of Speech and Other Preliminaries)**:
   - It discusses the properties of subjects, objects, and indirect objects in Wambaya.
   - Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).
   - The subject is represented by a bound pronoun in the auxiliary in main verbal clauses.
   - Objects take the accusative case and are represented by bound pronouns in the auxiliary for first and second person objects, but not for third person objects.

4. **Paragraph 14 (Chapter 5 The Auxiliary)**:
   - The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar and is obligatory in every main verbal clause.
   - The auxiliary contains bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause and most of the tense, aspect, and mood information.
   - The auxiliary almost always occurs in second position in the clause.

5. **Paragraph 17 (Chapter 7 Syntax of Simple Sentences)**:
   - It discusses basic verbal clauses in terms of their main verb and the core arguments they subcategorize for: subject, object, indirect object, and subject complements.
   - Direct objects are registered on the auxiliary with an object bound pronoun.
   - Indirect objects are not registered with an object bound pronoun in the auxiliary and are marked with the dative case.

6. **Paragraph 19 (Chapter 5 The Auxiliary)**:
   - The auxiliary in Wambaya contains bound pronouns that represent the subject and object (if present) of the clause.
   - The structure of the auxiliary is: Subject + (Object) + Tense/aspect/mood/directional.

7. **Paragraph 21 (Chapter 5 The Auxiliary)**:
   - Every auxiliary must contain a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of the clause.
   - Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary.

### Conclusion
Based on the information provided, Wambaya exhibits a relatively free word order, which is a common feature of Australian languages. The presence of the auxiliary, which contains bound pronouns for the subject and object, allows for flexibility in the positioning of these elements within the clause. This flexibility suggests that there is no single dominant word order for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nakkara is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object).

**Conclusion: SVO**",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Garrwa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, the following points are relevant to determining the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Garrwa, like many Australian languages, has free word order, but there are clear patterns of ordering. The canonical word order in simple sentences can be represented by a template where the core (comprising initial and second positions) is followed by core argument nominal groups and adjuncts.

2. **Paragraph 4**: It states that Garrwa verbs occur either clause initially or immediately after the second position, leading to the analysis that Garrwa has a verb-initial basic word order. This suggests a preference for V-initial structures.

3. **Paragraph 11**: It mentions that in declarative sentences of positive polarity, where there is no marked pragmatic constituent, the verb is the initial element of the core. This reinforces the verb-initial tendency.

4. **Paragraph 12**: It describes non-canonical word orders where elements other than the verb can occur initially due to pragmatic reasons, but this is marked and not the default structure.

5. **Paragraph 15**: It discusses the ordering of arguments, indicating that nominal arguments (A, S, O) are most frequently found directly following the second-position clitic cluster, which often follows the verb.

6. **Paragraph 16**: It mentions pragmatically determined non-canonical orders where nouns or other elements can occur initially for emphasis or contrast, but these are exceptions to the canonical order.

7. **Paragraph 29**: It provides an example where the verb is in the initial position followed by pronouns and other elements, supporting the V-initial structure.

8. **Paragraph 32**: It discusses the second-position clitic cluster and mentions that nominal arguments typically follow this cluster, which often follows the verb.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Garrwa appears to be **VSO**. The verb tends to occur initially, followed by the subject and then the object, with variations occurring due to pragmatic reasons.

**Conclusion: VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Ngankikurungkurr,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Ngankikurungkurr by examining the structure of sentences where both subject (S) and object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is clearly identifiable.

1. **Paragraph 4:**
   - Example: ""wa-wunu wupun-@-ta, e wa-wunu-ninggi dam-© -pawal""
   - Translation: ""He hit that man, then that man speared him.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""wa-wunu"" (that man) followed by the verb ""wupun-@-ta"" (hit) and then the object ""dam-© -pawal"" (him). This suggests an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Example: ""wananggal-ninggi yityi-meny-bi""
   - Translation: ""What did the doctor tell you/do to you.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""wananggal-ninggi"" (doctor) followed by the verb ""yityi-meny"" (tell/do) and then the object ""bi"" (you). This suggests an SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 11:**
   - Example: ""ngaenyi-tyerr-pu-pe""
   - Translation: ""I'm going to ask you.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""ngaenyi"" (I) followed by the verb ""tyerr-pu"" (ask) and then the object ""pe"" (you). This suggests an SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 19:**
   - Example: ""ngerrben-@-lulu""
   - Translation: ""We swore at him.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""ngerrben"" (we) followed by the verb ""lulu"" (swore) and then the object ""@"" (him). This suggests an SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 25:**
   - Example: ""warriny-© /gu -pawal""
   - Translation: ""They (dl) speared him.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""warriny"" (they) followed by the verb ""pawal"" (speared) and then the object ""©"" (him). This suggests an SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 30:**
   - Example: ""ngandim-wurrki-fi-me-nimegagu""
   - Translation: ""We (dlinc) gave them (trial) some beef.""
   - Analysis: The structure here shows the subject ""ngandim"" (we) followed by the verb ""wurrki-fi-me"" (gave) and then the object ""nimegagu"" (them). This suggests an SVO order.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The analysis of the provided paragraphs consistently shows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.",no dominant order,svo
Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, the following points can be summarized:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in Wagiman and mentions that there is no strong tendency for a particular order of constituents. It highlights that only a few sentences contained both subject (A) and object (O), and no strong order tendencies were found in sentences with two nominal participants.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph further supports the idea of flexible word order in Wagiman. It mentions that the object (O) tends to precede the verb (V) and/or agent (A) in many clauses, but this is not consistent enough to establish a dominant order. It concludes that Wagiman lacks a basic word order due to the lack of clauses containing two core NPs and the influence of pragmatic constraints.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the flexibility of constituent order in Wagiman and states that it is not easily amenable to a description involving the order of S, V, and O. It also mentions that the language is morphologically ergative, which complicates the determination of a basic word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the order of NP constituents and mentions that there is some flexibility in the order of modifiers relative to the noun. However, it does not provide specific information about the order of S, V, and O.

Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), we can determine the dominant word order of the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses various syntactic constructions, including the placement of the copula and the subject in different types of clauses. It mentions that the subject can be placed before or after the predicate, but it does not provide specific examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object participants.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes the syntax of verbs and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. Examples include:
   - ""A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla."" (‘A: “Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’”)
   - ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše."" (‘The Christians were not slipping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’)
   These examples show a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides a table of contents and does not contain specific examples of word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses various types of subordinate clauses and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. Examples include:
   - ""b8y6n ""álaha t-yaw•lli m•ndi zàwda."" (‘I want God to give me something more.’)
   - ""la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a."" (‘I do not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed has died.’)
   These examples show a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses extraposed nominals and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. Examples include:
   - ""tàwra} primále ðá ""íðe dìye."" (‘The ox—he cut off one of its feet.’)
   - ""Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye."" (‘Blind David—his father and mother urged him.’)
   These examples show a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the copula clause and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. Examples include:
   - ""xòðiw6n."" (‘I am by myself.’)
   - ""xàwr6n-ile."" (‘He is our friend.’)
   These examples do not provide clear evidence of word order in declarative sentences with both subject and object participants.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the verb ""to be"" and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. Examples include:
   - ""mèra yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu,} ‘ìdetu} ta-mšax•lpi š•mm6t ’ùxo} mattúle xá-š6mma xèna."" (‘He said “Come, come, you are invited” in order for them to change the name ’uxo and give him another name. They came. They ate and drank.’)

Conclusion: SVO",sov,svo
English,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar, we can deduce the dominant word order in English by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""You heard their arguments"" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject (You) precedes the verb (heard), which precedes the object (their arguments). This is identified as the basic order S–P–O (Subject–Predicator–Object).

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example: ""You heard their arguments"" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject (You) is before the predicator (heard), and the object (their arguments) follows the predicator. This confirms the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example: ""The others were taken by her"" (passive) and ""The others she took"" (preposing)
   - Explanation: Even in non-canonical constructions like passives and preposing, the basic SVO order is evident when reverting to the canonical form: ""She took the others"" (SVO).

4. **Paragraph 24**:
   - Example: ""She took the others"" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject (She) precedes the verb (took), which precedes the object (the others). This reinforces the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 25**:
   - Example: ""Who bought it?"" (interrogative with subject–auxiliary inversion)
   - Explanation: The basic order in declarative sentences is maintained as SVO, as seen in the transformation from ""Someone bought it"" to ""Who bought it?""

6. **Paragraph 30**:
   - Example: ""I sent Sue a copy"" (SVO with ditransitive verb)
   - Explanation: The subject (I) precedes the verb (sent), which precedes the objects (Sue and a copy). This shows a more complex SVO structure but still adheres to the SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 36**:
   - Example: ""She finished the work"" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject (She) precedes the verb (finished), which precedes the object (the work). This is another clear instance of SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 38**:
   - Example: ""He gave Sue a copy"" (SVO with ditransitive verb)
   - Explanation: The subject (He) precedes the verb (gave), which precedes the objects (Sue and a copy). This confirms the SVO order even in ditransitive constructions.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in English, based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar, is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object). This is consistently demonstrated across various examples and syntactic structures.",svo,svo
Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the typical sentence structure and provides examples such as ""Ayki (ka) emeni (lul) ponta"" ('The baby looks at the mother') and ""Emeni (ka) ayki",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Basque,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in Basque and mentions that different permutations of constituents are grammatical. However, it also states that most Basque grammarians identify SOV as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that SOV is considered the 'neutral' or 'basic' word order in Basque. It explains that while other orders are possible, they often carry a focalized interpretation, suggesting that SOV is the unmarked, neutral order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of dative nominals and mentions that the basic verb-final character of Basque is evident in various syntactic structures. It also states that absolutive sequences are interpreted as subject-object sequences, further supporting the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that heavy elements, especially clauses, tend to occur to the right in Basque, which can result in SVO order when the object is a clause. However, this is an exception rather than the rule, and the basic order remains SOV.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the constraints on word order when the neutral or canonical order is altered. It emphasizes that only the preverbal phrase can be interpreted as new or focalized information, reinforcing the idea that the verb typically comes last in the neutral order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the interpretation of SOV sentences and mentions that in some dialects, SOV sentences need not have a focalized constituent, suggesting that SOV can be neutral and unmarked.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the word order within relative clauses and states that the inflected verb must appear at the end of the relative clause, which aligns with the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the order of constituents in finite embedded clauses and mentions that the standard word order in a Basque finite clause has the auxiliary following the verb, which is consistent with the SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the dual subcategorization of certain verbs and mentions that the preferred interpretation often aligns with the SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses gapping structures and mentions that for SOV languages, the expected pattern is SO + SOV, further supporting the SOV order.

Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the most relevant information for determining the dominant word order in Malayalam is found in Paragraph 3:

> ""Though the verb usually occupies the final position in the sentence as in the examples of 1.1.1 it may be noted that word order is not rigid as seen below.""

This statement indicates that the verb typically appears at the end of the sentence, which is characteristic of SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order. Although it mentions that the word order is not rigid, the use of ""usually"" suggests a dominant pattern.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Iu Mien,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mien, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the evidence and arguments presented:

1. **Paragraph 1**: States that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language and mentions that it does not have a strictly grammaticalized SVO pattern.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**: Indicates that Iu Mien shows an SVO order in pragmatically neutral clauses but also mentions object-fronting for discourse-pragmatic purposes.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Emphasizes that Iu Mien is not primarily an SVO language and that pragmatics play a significant role in word-order choice.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Argues that SVO order in Iu Mien is rare and that the language follows a Topic-Focus word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the verb-medial word order and mentions that the post-verbal NP is not necessarily the subject or object, reinforcing the idea that SVO is not strictly grammaticalized.

6. **Paragraph 6**: States that an isolated SVO order is rare in Iu Mien and that the language does not use case marking but relies on word order to indicate grammatical relations.

7. **Paragraph 8**: Describes Iu Mien as a topic-prominent language rather than an SVO language.

8. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the variability in word order and suggests that Iu Mien should be described in its own terms, not strictly as an SVO language.

9. **Paragraph 12**: Reinforces that the so-called SVO order is not grammaticalized in Iu Mien.

10. **Paragraph 14**: Summarizes that Iu Mien is a pragmatically configured verb-medial language and not strictly an SVO language.

11. **Paragraph 17**: States that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language with pragmatically assigned positions for Topic and Focus, which may appear as SVO but are not necessarily grammaticalized.

12. **Paragraph 30**: Emphasizes the dominance of the topic-focus order in actual speech events and discourse.

13. **Paragraph 31**: Mentions that word order is determined by pragmatic motivation of information structure.

14. **Paragraph 49**: Provides a basic constituent order at the sentence level, highlighting the importance of Topic and Focus.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence from the paragraphs, it is clear that while SVO order does occur in Iu Mien, it is not the dominant or strictly grammaticalized order. Instead, the language relies heavily on pragmatic principles, particularly a Topic-Focus structure. Therefore, the dominant word order in Iu Mien cannot be classified strictly as SVO or any other specific order due to its reliance on pragmatics.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Semelai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Semelai, we can analyze the dominant word order in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the most frequently employed constituent order is verb-initial, with either A (subject) and O (object), or S (subject) placed after the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** states that constituent order in Semelai is fluid and allows a range of variations. It mentions that in transitive clauses, there is a tendency for verb-initial structures, although this is not always reflected in spontaneous discourse.

3. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that many clauses consist only of a verb or a verb and pronominal proclitic, complicating the characterization of a basic constituent order.

4. **Paragraph 7** indicates that the S in the COMP (complementizer) is post-verbal, reflecting permissible main clause word order VS (Verb-Subject).

5. **Paragraph 17** describes the universal clause in transitive structures as having the constituent order AVO (Agent-Verb-Object).

6. **Paragraph 28** confirms that in transitive clauses, the ordering is usually verb-initial, although any argument may be pre-verbal.

7. **Paragraph 31** mentions that the ordering of constituents in the transitive COMP is V(O)(PP), identical to the constituent order of the universal clause.

8. **Paragraph 36** discusses the syntactic typology of Semelai, highlighting head and dependent marking, and the proclitic system for marking core grammatical relations.

From these points, it is clear that while Semelai exhibits fluid word order influenced by pragmatic factors, there is a strong tendency for verb-initial structures, especially in transitive clauses. This suggests a preference for VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) or VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) orders.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The evidence suggests that while there is a tendency for verb-initial structures, the fluidity and variability in word order, influenced by pragmatic and discourse factors, prevent us from conclusively determining a single dominant word order. Therefore, the most accurate classification for Semelai is ""No dominant order.""",no dominant order,no dominant order
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), the dominant word order can be determined by examining the frequency and flexibility of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) arrangement in declarative sentences. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that the most frequent word order in terms of core constituents is subject-object-verb (SOV). However, it also mentions that the word order is flexible, particularly in finite clauses, and follows a ""discourse-oriented"" scheme.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reiterates that the most frequent word order is verb-final, which aligns with the SOV structure. It also notes that the relative order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles.

3. **Paragraph 5**: It mentions deviations from the SOV order, such as right dislocation and clause-initial objects, but these are described as infrequent and occurring under specific discourse conditions.

4. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph reinforces that the dominant word order in noun phrases and non-finite clauses is head-final, which supports the SOV structure. It also mentions that SOV is preferred in main clauses, although other orders are possible.

5. **Paragraph 11**: It provides examples of sentences where the subject precedes the object and the verb, consistent with the SOV order. It also notes that a non-Focus object can precede the subject, indicating some flexibility.

6. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the marking properties and syntactic functions, suggesting that the primary participant role (A/S) serves as a major syntactic function, which is consistent with a subject-initial structure.

7. **Paragraph 24**: It describes the noun phrase structure as head-final, which is consistent with the SOV order in clauses.

8. **Paragraph 36**: It mentions that the primary relativization strategy is applied for the subject, direct object, and other constituents, which aligns with the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Yukaghir (Kolyma) is **SOV**.

Alutor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alutor, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Alutor has free word order and that it is often difficult to claim which order is basic. However, it also states that the most frequent word order structures in verbal clauses are SVO and VSO.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of word order in clauses with nominal predicates, showing variability between SV and VS orders.

3. **Paragraph 11** indicates that the order of main and subordinate clauses is not fixed, and embedding of parts of the subordinate clause into the main clause is possible.

4. **Paragraph 12** discusses the use of existential clauses, which are not strictly nominal and involve a verb governing the nominative S-argument.

5. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 17** discuss incorporation and how it affects the syntactic structure, but do not provide direct evidence for a dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss phonological processes and syllable structure, which are not directly relevant to determining word order.

7. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** provide examples of potential and optative forms, but these are not directly relevant to determining the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

8. **Paragraph 30** and **Paragraph 31** discuss the syntax of incorporation and the use of participles, but again, do not provide direct evidence for a dominant word order.

From the above points, the most relevant information comes from **Paragraph 1**, which explicitly mentions that the most frequent word order structures in verbal clauses are SVO and VSO. This suggests that while Alutor has a degree of flexibility in word order, SVO and VSO are the most commonly observed patterns.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The grammar indicates that Alutor exhibits free word order with SVO and VSO being the most frequent structures. However, it does not establish a single dominant word order, instead highlighting the variability and flexibility in the language's syntax.",no dominant order,no dominant order

Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), the dominant word order can be determined by examining the syntactic structures and examples given. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the usual word order in Nivkh:
   - ""The usual word order in Nivkh is, as was shown in chapter 1.3.7, (125) topic - embedded clause _ adverbials ~ subject_ causee _ secondary object_ primary object-predicate.""
   - This suggests a structure where the subject (S) precedes the primary object (O) and the verb (V) comes at the end, indicating an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 8** explicitly states:
   - ""Nivkh is a head-marking SOV language (in the sense of Nichols 1986) with a fairly consistent final predicate position.""
   - This directly confirms that the dominant word order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 9** provides examples of ditransitive verbs and their word order:
   - ""Suffice it here to note the word order with Nivkh ditransitive verbs: (63) Subject ^ Secondary Object ^ Primary Object-Predicate.""
   - This again supports the SOV structure, with the subject coming first, followed by objects, and the verb at the end.

4. **Paragraph 12** discusses demotion and word order in ditransitive verbs:
   - ""The constructional alternatives for ditransitive verbs follow: (i) unmarked version ... secondary object (= patient) _ primary object (= recipient/goal)-verb.""
   - This reinforces the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 13** mentions the structure of verb forms:
   - ""In organization type (ii), the components of a verb form are not fixed in their position, but rather in their scope, which allows them to be ordered according to the intended meaning.""
   - While this suggests some flexibility, it does not contradict the dominant SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 18** discusses the role of morphology and syntax:
   - ""Nivkh is a head-marking language, in line with Fortescue's postulation about polysynthetic languages (1994:2601, point (i)), but not a non-configurational one.""
   - This supports the idea of a consistent syntactic structure, which aligns with the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) is **SOV**.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Jarawa (in Andamans),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, the dominant word order in the language can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** (5.4.1 Word order in clauses): This paragraph explicitly states that ""Jarawa is an SOV language: the subject precedes the object and the object precedes the verb."" This is a clear and direct statement about the dominant word order in Jarawa.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph supports the SOV order by describing that in ditransitive sentences, the direct object and indirect object exhibit free word order between them but follow the overall SOV pattern where the subject precedes the direct object, and the direct object precedes the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph further reinforces the SOV structure by stating that in ditransitive clauses, the subject precedes the objects (both direct and indirect), and the objects precede the verb.

4. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph describes the general schema of a clause in Jarawa, which aligns with the SOV order: ""[Subject]NP {[IO]NP [DO]NP} Verb]]VP"".

5. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph provides an example of a transitive clause where the subject precedes the object, and the object precedes the verb, consistent with the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 35**: This paragraph discusses the placement of peripheral arguments in SOV languages, noting that Jarawa places peripheral arguments before the verb, which is typical of SOV languages.

7. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph describes the structure of transitive clauses in Jarawa, where the subject precedes the object, and the object precedes the verb, further confirming the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph concludes that Jarawa is an SOV language but notes some deviations from typical SOV patterns in other respects.

### Conclusion:

Kusunda,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kusunda, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the syntactic structure of sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is finite.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (258b): ""pyana tsi agai-da pumba-d-i"" translates to ""Yesterday I beat the dog.""
     - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject, ""agai-da"" (dog-ACC) is the object, and ""pumba-d-i"" (beat-1-PAST) is the verb.
     - The order is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (113d): ""gina-Ø t˙n-da t˙mb˙-g-˙n"" translates to ""He sent me.""
     - Here, ""gina-Ø"" (he-NOM) is the subject, ""t˙n-da"" (I-ACC) is the object, and ""t˙mb˙-g-˙n"" (send-3-REAL) is the verb.
     - The order is SOV.
   - Example (258b) is repeated here for emphasis: ""pyana tsi agai-da pumba-d-i"" translates to ""Yesterday I beat the dog.""
     - The order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (319a): ""tsi k˙la-d-ßn d˙idzi kila-˙-g-˙n"" translates to ""He stole the firewood I chopped.""
     - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject, ""k˙la-d-ßn d˙idzi"" (firewood) is the object, and ""kila-˙-g-˙n"" (steal-3-REAL) is the verb.
     - The order is SOV.
   - Example (319b): ""nu pumb˙-n-i ip˙n"" translates to ""corn that you beat (thrashed).""
     - Here, ""nu"" (you) is the subject, ""ip˙n"" (corn) is the object, and ""pumb˙-n-i"" (beat-2-PAST) is the verb.
     - The order is SOV.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (255a): ""tsi hul˙-d-ßn-tsi"" translates to ""I cooked it.""
     - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject, ""hul˙-d-ßn"" (cook-1-REAL) is the verb, and the object is implied.
     - The order is SOV.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (318a): ""d˙-g-˙n nu hampe"" translates to ""Where is the person who went?""
     - Here, ""d˙-g-˙n"" (go-3-REAL) is the verb, ""nu"" (person) is the subject, and ""hampe"" (where) is the object.
     - The order is SOV.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (243c): ""tsi du≥dzi a-d-i"" translates to ""I beat the drum.""

      - Here, ""tok"" (we) is the subject, ""hyoq-ßn"" (hide-NEUT) is the verb, and the object is implied.
      - The order is SOV.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Kusunda is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on multiple examples from the provided paragraphs where the subject, object, and verb are clearly identifiable and consistently follow the SOV order.",sov,sov
Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Udihe exhibits typological features of a head-final SOV language and that the SOV order is the most common statistically. It also provides examples illustrating the typical SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that Udihe is a head-final SOV language, although head-finality is not rigid. It mentions that in the matrix clause, word order is largely motivated by information structure, but the SOV order is still the most common.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in Udihe, all of which follow the SOV order. It also states that the SOV order in Udihe seems to be a result of three independent requirements: the preverbal position of the focus, subject/topic initiality, and verb finality.

4. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph emphasizes the importance of the preverbal position of the focus element in Udihe word order. It states that in a clause that does not involve any constituents other than SOV, the object typically corresponds to the focus function, resulting in the preverbal position of the object, which aligns with the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph mentions that yes-no questions in Udihe do not involve changes in word order compared to declarative sentences, and the finite verb normally occupies the clause-final position, which is consistent with the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph discusses the topicalized left-dislocated accusative noun phrase, which is separated by a pause from the rest of the sentence. This indicates that while there are variations in word order due to information structure, the underlying SOV order is still prevalent.

7. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in Udihe where the subject and object are nouns, and the verb is in the final position, consistent with the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 28**: This paragraph discusses the possessive noun phrase, which has a fixed word order ""modifier - head"" and does not undergo inversion due to information structure. This indicates that while there are variations in noun phrase structure, the overall clause structure remains SOV.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Ingush is a head-final language with verb-second order in main clauses, similar to Germanic languages. This suggests that the verb often appears in the second position in main clauses, but it does not specify the exact order of subject and object around the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** states that the grammatically most basic order of arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV. This indicates that the subject typically precedes the verb (SV) and the object follows the verb (AOV). However, it also mentions that this order is not rigid and can vary.

3. **Paragraph 4** reinforces that verb-final order (AOV and SV) can be found in pragmatically neutral main clauses and non-main clauses. This suggests that in neutral contexts, the verb tends to appear at the end of the clause, with the subject preceding the object.

4. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end of the clause, supporting the idea of a verb-final structure in neutral contexts.

5. **Paragraph 11** describes existential, locative, and possessive sentences, noting that the basic or neutral order is A patterner + O patterner + V, which aligns with the AOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 30** mentions that verb-final order is found in episode-initial clauses and non-main clauses, further supporting the AOV structure in neutral contexts.

7. **Paragraph 32** discusses core chaining and narrative chaining, where the verb often appears in the second position, but this is within the context of chaining and not necessarily indicative of the basic word order in simple declarative sentences.

8. **Paragraph 33** mentions that in conservative usage, the shared argument in core chaining is usually in the nominative case, and the main clause often follows verb-second order, but this is specific to chaining constructions.

9. **Paragraph 34** provides examples of verb-final order in non-main clauses and pragmatically neutral main clauses, reinforcing the AOV structure.

10. **Paragraph 35** discusses the structure of noun phrases and the ordering of elements within them, but this is not directly relevant to the basic word order of clauses.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ingush appears to be **AOV (Subject-Object-Verb)** in pragmatically neutral contexts, particularly in non-main clauses and episode-initial clauses. This is supported by multiple references to verb-final order (AOV and SV) in neutral contexts and the basic order of arguments being AOV.

**Conclusion: AOV**",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e., verb-final. It mentions that verb-final order is the preferred word order in independent sentences, although alternative orders are possible, especially in colloquial language. This suggests a tendency towards SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides examples where the finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This further supports the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that the order of the arguments with respect to each other seems to be determined by information structure rather than by grammatical relations. Given information tends to precede new information, and the subject simply is most often given information. This implies that while there is flexibility, the subject often precedes the object and verb, aligning with SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: It states that while word order in Lezgian is generally rather free, there is a very strong tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adjacent. This supports the idea that while flexibility exists, there is still a strong tendency towards a specific order, likely SOV.

5. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples where the subject precedes the object and verb, such as ""Alfija wrote an article"" and ""Mu'minat saw Ibrahim,"" which align with SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 12**: It mentions that non-verb-final word order is not uncommon in direct speech in narrative prose, especially in questions and in emphatic or emotional speech. This indicates that while SOV is dominant, other orders can appear in specific contexts.

7. **Paragraph 11**: It provides examples of coordination where the verb follows the object, further supporting the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 10**: It describes the syntax of complement clauses, where the verb often appears at the end, consistent with SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Lezgian is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Galo,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph discusses the flexibility of constituent order in Galo and mentions that any constituent order is possible. However, it also notes that the initial noun phrase is almost always understood as more agentive, which could be weak evidence for a preferred Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. The example provided shows both SOV and OSV orders but emphasizes the interpretation of the initial noun phrase as agentive.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph provides evidence from constituent order and states that the statistically most frequent Galo constituent order is A O V (SOV). It also mentions that constituents may be arranged in the most pragmatically useful order, indicating some flexibility. However, the preference for A O V is clear.

Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and explanations given.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (73): ""assik-ai mikelngu-u-tP Elitnauriste-mA"" translates to ""The teacher likes the children."" Here, the order is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
   - Example (75): 
     - (a) ""Elitnauriste-tA mikelngu-u-tP assik-ait"" translates to ""The teachers like the children."" This is SOV.
     - (b) ""Mikelngu-u-tA elitnauriste-tP assik-ait"" translates to ""The children like the teachers."" This is OSV.
   - Example (76): ""Apt-ait mikelgu-u-tA angute-tP"" translates to ""The children asked the men."" This is VOS.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Discusses the flexibility of word order and mentions that nominal phrases can be split by another syntactically remote word. This indicates a high degree of flexibility in word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (70): ""Tai-ciq-ni-a unuaqu"" translates to ""He says she/he (another) will come tomorrow."" This is VSO.
   - Example (71): ""Tai-ciq-ni-luni unuaqu pi-uq ~ qaner-tuq"" translates to ""He says he (himself) will come tomorrow."" This is VSO.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (79): 
     - (a) ""TaqukaqP tuqut-aa"" translates to ""He killed the bear."" This is VOS.
     - (b) ""[Ik’-u-m angute-m]A taqukaqP tuqut-aa"" translates to ""That man across there killed the bear."" This is SOV.
   - Example (80): 
     - (a) ""Na-ni nataqe-ciq-sia?"" translates to ""Where shall I find him/her?"" This is VSO.
     - (b) ""Na-ni nataqe-ciq-sia [angun im-na / tau-na sugtu-lria]P?"" translates to ""Where shall I find that man who is tall?"" This is VSO.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (62): ""Akerte-mi=lli puqlanir-paa! ~ Puqlanir-paa=lli akerte-mi!"" translates to ""How warm the sun is!"" This shows that word order can be flexible in exclamative constructions.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (154): ""nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-aqa Nuk’a-mun(A"") arna-mun(A') mikelnguqP=S(A) nayir-mek(P)"" translates to ""I think Nukaq asked the woman to let the child eat a seal."" This is SOV.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (235): ""Yu-u-ngnaqe-llr-atgun tang-lar-aput [qanr-uy-ut-e-mG atu-uci-a]P"" translates to ""We used to see their adhering to/obeying the advice/command in the way they make a living."" This is SOV.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (41): ""muluk’uu-mek (ABM.sg.)"" translates to ""milk."" This does not provide information on word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (57): 
     - (a) ""pissur-ciqe-nqigg-ni-a"" translates to ""she says that he will go hunting again."" This is VSO.
     - (b) ""pissur-ciq-ni-nqigt-aa"" translates to ""she again says that he will go hunting."" This is VSO.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Example (80): ""|kiu[+ћaћլ+ƾa| (answer-IND.3sg.3sg.)"" translates to ""he answers (question) him/her."" This is VSO.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Yup'ik (Norton Sound) exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order. However, there is a measurable preference for SOV order in unmarked sentences, as indicated by several examples. Therefore, the dominant word order for Yup'ik (Norton Sound) can be concluded as:

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Verb-Final Tendency**: The first paragraph explicitly states that ""Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final,"" and provides multiple examples where the verb is consistently placed at the end of the clause. This is a strong indicator of an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure.

2. **Examples of SOV Order**:
   - Example (1): ""you fellows laughed yesterday"" (verb-final)
   - Example (2): ""I like to gig (hunt) fish"" (verb-final)
   - Example (3): ""he gave me his (someone else’s) baby"" (verb-final)
   - Example (4): ""And all who were in the ceremonial house came out, and looked"" (verb-final in connected speech)

3. **Complement Clauses and Quotative Inversion**: The text mentions that non-verb-final word order occurs when a sentence contains a complement clause, often following quotations. However, this is noted as a variation rather than the norm.

4. **Additional Examples**: The examples provided in the paragraphs consistently show the verb at the end of the clause, reinforcing the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Pipil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences, particularly focusing on sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS).
   - Examples of VOS order:
     - ""ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin."" (""The little man put down his jacket."")
     - ""mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe."" (""The youngest son has given you (pl.) the advice."")
     - ""kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk pih-pi:pil-met."" (""The prince gave the other boys (a) position."")
     - ""ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín."" (""The boys made the fire."")
     - ""ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t."" (""The man killed the cow."")
   - Other orders like SVO and VSO occur but are less frequent and often marked for emphasis or heaviness of the object.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Intransitive sentences rarely deviate from the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order.
   - Examples of VS order:
     - ""ya:h-ki ne tengerecheh."" (""The lizard went."")
     - ""mu-kwep-ki ne tengerechul."" (""The lizard returned."")
   - Verb-Object (VO) order is found often in transitive sentences where the subject is pronominal and signaled by a verb prefix.
   - Examples of VO order:
     - ""ki-chiw-ki ne komidah."" (""She made the food."")

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - The orders OV and SV also occur but only to emphasize the object or the subject, respectively.
   - Examples of OV and SV:
     - ""mas bién i-kwit turuh ni-k-kwah."" (""Rather it was cow's excrement that I ate."")
     - ""ne nu-sapatus n-yu ni-k-tamu:ta."" (""I'm going to throw away my shoes."")
     - ""nu-tatanóy nech-chiw-ki kontár."" (""My grandfather told me."")
     - ""nu-lama mltsin-chiwa nemi hodêr."" (""My grandmother is screwing you (pl.)."")

4. **Paragraph 3**:
   - In copular sentences, the order is Subject-Complement.
   - Examples:
     - ""mu-manuh mas bibo."" (""Your brother (is) smarter."")
     - ""yaha albolário."" (""He (is a) wizard."")
     - ""ini nu-kuhkul."" (""This (is) my bogeyman."")

5. **Paragraph 7**:
   - The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is VOS.
   - Examples of VOS order:
     - ""ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin."" (""The little man put down his jacket."")
     - ""mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe."" (""The youngest son has given you (pl.) the advice."")
     - ""kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk pih-pi:pil-met."" (""The prince gave the other boys (a) position."")
     - ""ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín."" (""The boys made the fire."")
     - ""ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t."" (""The man killed the cow."")

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Pipil for declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is **VOS**.

**Conclusion: VOS**",no dominant order,vos
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Micmac, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that in transitive verbs, copies of both the object and subject must appear after the verb stem in some order, suggesting a post-verbal position for both subject and object.
2. **Paragraph 3** reinforces this by stating that the object marker precedes the subject marker, both following the verb stem.
3. **Paragraph 5** indicates that the simplest set of transformations operates on the underlying order Object-Subject, supporting the contention that this order is correct.
4. **Paragraph 14** mentions that certain forms appear in subj-obj order, while others appear in obj-subj order, hinting at variability but with a tendency towards post-verbal positioning.
5. **Paragraph 15** provides an underlying structure for Micmac as Subject-Verb-Object, which might suggest an SVO order in some contexts.
6. **Paragraph 17** shows a structure where the verb appears before the subject and object, indicating a V-initial order.
7. **Paragraph 19** states that in languages that inflect verbs for objects as well as subjects, the ""Object copy"" is always closest to the verb, implying a VOS or VSO structure.

The evidence points towards a verb-initial structure, with the object often preceding the subject in the post-verbal position. This suggests that the dominant word order in Micmac is likely **VOS** or **VSO**. Given the stronger emphasis on the object preceding the subject after the verb, **VOS** seems more probable.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huehuetla Tepehua, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the statistical data and examples given.

1. **Statistical Data**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Table 32 shows that out of 569 transitive clauses, the most frequent orders with two overt arguments are SVO (2.6%), VSO (2.3%), and OVS (0.9%). SOV does not occur at all.
   - **Paragraph 2**: Table 34 reiterates that SVO (39.5%) and VSO (34.2%) are the most frequent orders in transitive clauses with two arguments.
   - **Paragraph 3**: Table 31 indicates that in intransitive clauses, the subject follows the verb in 79.6% of the cases (VS order).
   - **Paragraph 4**: Example (733) shows that all six possible word orders are acceptable, but the pragmatics of the clause often determine the syntactic roles.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Table 37 shows that when the pronoun is the object, it follows the verb in 56.3% of the clauses.
   - **Paragraph 6**: Table 38 indicates that in nonverbal pronominal predications, the pronoun precedes the predicate in 83% of the examples.
   - **Paragraph 7**: Example (734) shows that when the verb is clause-initial, the clause-final nominal is interpreted as the object.
   - **Paragraph 8**: The grammar states that in pragmatically neutral clauses collected during elicitation, VSO is the word order, but SVO is also readily accepted by speakers. Statistical analysis indicates a slight preference for SVO, followed closely by VSO.
   - **Paragraph 9**: Example (809) shows post-nominal relative clauses and headless relative clauses, indicating that the language allows for flexible word order depending on the context.
   - **Paragraph 10**: Example (811) shows post-nominal relativized subjects, indicating that the subject can follow the verb in relative clauses.
   - **Paragraph 11**: Example (733) shows variable word order, but the context often clarifies the syntactic roles.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Example (736)**: SVO order in a narrative context.
   - **Example (737)**: VSO order in a narrative context.
   - **Example (738)**: OVS order in a narrative context.
   - **Example (739)**: VOS order in a narrative context.
   - **Example (740)**: OSV order, noted as awkward by a native speaker.

### Conclusion:
Based on the statistical data and examples provided, Huehuetla Tepehua exhibits a preference for SVO and VSO word orders in transitive clauses. The statistical analysis indicates a slight preference for SVO, followed closely by VSO. Therefore, the dominant word order in Huehuetla Tepehua is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no direct evidence or clear examples that explicitly state or demonstrate the dominant word order (SOV, SVO, VOS, VSO, OVS, OSV) in Musqueam. The paragraphs contain various linguistic details about pronouns, verb inflections, and other grammatical aspects, but none of them provide a clear indication of the typical order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 31, 34, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, and 50**: These paragraphs discuss various grammatical features such as pronouns, verb inflections, and particles but do not provide explicit information about the word order in declarative sentences.
2. **Paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 47, and 48**: These paragraphs either discuss phonological aspects, morphophonemics, or provide references and examples that are not directly related to the syntactic structure of declarative sentences.

Given the lack of explicit information on the dominant word order in the provided text, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order for Musqueam from these paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Not mentioned in the grammar.",vso,not mentioned in the grammar
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Omaha can be determined as follows:

**Paragraph 3** is particularly relevant:
> ""Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after their nouns, whether these are subject or object. This is entirely different than in English, where object nouns normally come after their verb. Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught (transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse (object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].""

This paragraph clearly indicates that in Omaha, the verb follows both the subject and the object. This structure corresponds to the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order.

**Paragraph 38** also supports this:
> ""A noun can be modified by a verb. When this happens in English, we put the verb in front of the noun. In Omaha, the verb follows the noun.""

This further reinforces that verbs follow nouns in Omaha, aligning with the SOV order.

**Paragraph 10** provides additional context:
> ""In Omaha a verb can stand alone as a complete sentence, without needing a subject in front of it as in English. The subject is implied. This is the Omaha way of saying that he, she or it is doing something.""

While this paragraph discusses the possibility of verbs standing alone, it does not contradict the SOV order when both subject and object are present.

**Paragraph 12**:
> ""Omaha object pronouns are affixed to the front of the verb, just as the subject pronouns are. For Omaha, we call the direct object pronouns the patient pronouns.""

This indicates that pronouns are affixed to verbs, but does not provide contradictory information to the SOV order for full noun phrases.

**Paragraph 24**:
> ""In Omaha a simple transitive verb implies a discrete object, whether or not the object is mentioned. If no object is mentioned, the object is assumed to be 'him,' 'her,' 'it,' or 'them.'""

This paragraph discusses the implication of objects but does not contradict the SOV order when both subject and object are explicitly mentioned.

**Conclusion**: SOV",sov,sov
Washo,"To determine the dominant word order in Washo, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any explicit or implicit information about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here are the relevant observations from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph is not clear due to the garbled text, making it difficult to extract any meaningful information about word order.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions examples of sentences with subjects and objects, but the text is too corrupted to extract clear examples of word order.

3. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the expansion of pronouns and the structure of double-transitive verbs, but it does not provide clear examples of the order of subject, object, and verb.

4. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph provides examples of expanded forms for subjects and objects in double-transitive verbs, but the text is too corrupted to determine the word order.

5. **Paragraph 32**: This paragraph mentions the structure of double-transitive verbs and the expansion of pronouns, but it does not provide clear examples of word order.

6. **Paragraph 42**: This paragraph discusses the expansion of pronouns and the structure of double-transitive verbs, but it does not provide clear examples of word order.

7. **Paragraph 48**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects, but the text is too corrupted to determine the word order.

From the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to extract clear and unambiguous examples of the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences due to the corrupted and fragmented nature of the text. Therefore, based on the available information:

1. **Reasoning**: The provided paragraphs do not contain clear and unambiguous examples of the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences due to the corrupted and fragmented nature of the text.

2. **Conclusion**: Not mentioned in the grammar.",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object, verb (SOV). This paragraph also provides additional details about variations when indirect objects or locative phrases are involved, but it consistently places the verb at the end of the sentence.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** mentions that although Koasati employs nominal cases, which can lead to some word order variation, the most unmarked word order remains SOV. This indicates that while there might be some flexibility due to case marking, the preferred or basic order is still SOV.

3. **Paragraph 5** notes that the order with the object following the verb (SVO) is quite unusual and occurs only in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the verbal element. This reinforces that SOV is the dominant order, with SVO being a marked or less common alternative.

4. **Paragraph 7** states that the order VSO never seems to occur, which further supports the dominance of SOV by eliminating another possible word order.

5. **Paragraph 14** provides examples where the subject precedes the verb in intransitive sentences and the object precedes the verb in transitive sentences, aligning with the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 16** mentions that noun modifiers follow the modified noun, which aligns with the SOV structure where the verb typically comes last, and modifiers follow the nouns they modify.

7. **Paragraph 23** discusses the use of the accusative case suffix -n, which is used in contexts where word order alone is sufficient to indicate that the noun is the object of the verb. This implies that the object typically precedes the verb, consistent with SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 37** mentions that numerals, which are verbs in Koasati, must be related to the main verb of the sentence, and the noun governed by a numeral is the subject of the verbal phrase, again suggesting a structure where the verb comes last.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Chumash (Barbareño),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph explicitly states that ""a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure."" It further elaborates that the verb-initial word order occurs in both independent and dependent clauses. This is a clear indication that VOS is the dominant word order in Barbareño Chumash.

2. **Paragraph 18**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of sentences with the VOS structure. For instance, it shows sentences where the verb comes first, followed by the object and then the subject. This reinforces the information given in Paragraph 1 about the VOS structure being prevalent.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - This paragraph discusses the structure of relative clauses and mentions that all relative clauses are postnominal. While it does not directly address the basic word order of declarative sentences, it supports the verb-initial tendency by showing how relative clauses are structured in relation to their head nouns.

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph provides an example of a sentence with a VOS structure: ""They have the wick long enough so that the lard in the can will not catch on fire."" Here, the verb ""have"" precedes the object ""the wick"" and the subject ""they.""

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - This paragraph gives additional examples of VOS sentences, such as ""One also drank salt water to wash the whole inside of the body."" Again, the verb ""drank"" comes first, followed by the object ""salt water"" and the subject ""one.""

6. **Paragraph 27**:
   - This paragraph discusses the use of the applicative suffix -us and provides examples where the verb precedes the object and subject, consistent with the VOS order.

### Conclusion:
**VOS**

The dominant word order in Barbareño Chumash is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS), as explicitly stated and exemplified in the provided paragraphs.",vos,vos
Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi (Euchee), the dominant word order can be determined by analyzing the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order in a two-place verb (transitive sentence) is Actor (A) then Patient (P), then Verb (V). This directly translates to Subject (S), Object (O), Verb (V), indicating an SOV order.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 by stating that Euchee is an APV (SOV) word order language. It also mentions that noun phrases can move for emphasis, but the basic order remains APV (SOV).

3. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions the order for first and second person actors as P-A-V (Patient-Actor-Verb), which aligns with the SOV structure when considering third-person actors.

4. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph summarizes the grammatical structure of Euchee, stating that it has a basic SOV word order.

5. **Paragraph 27**: This paragraph provides examples of the A-P-V (SOV) order for third-person actors and patients, further confirming the dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 1**: The examples provided in this paragraph (e.g., ""Sissy Sonny siothzshane"" for ""Sissy loves Sonny"") follow the SOV structure.

Given the consistent references to the SOV structure across multiple paragraphs and the explicit statements about the basic word order, it is clear that the dominant word order in Yuchi is SOV.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 7** mentions that each part of the sentence (excepting the pronominal subjects and objects) is represented by a phonetically independent unit, whose position may be easily shifted without impairing the sense of a complex of words. This suggests a flexible word order.

2. **Paragraph 13** states that the subject of a sentence may appear in initial, medial, or terminal position, indicating that the subject's position is not fixed.

3. **Paragraph 18** provides examples where the nominal object must appear after the verb but may precede or follow the subject of the sentence. This suggests that the object typically follows the verb, but the subject's position is more variable.

4. **Paragraph 39** mentions that the verb appears in terminal position in all such cases, which aligns with the SOV order but also indicates flexibility.

5. **Paragraph 19** discusses the position of elements in a complex of words, emphasizing that they form no unit with either a preceding or following word, being phonetically independent. This further supports the idea of flexible word order.

From these observations, it is clear that Alsea does not have a rigid word order and allows for significant flexibility in the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs. Therefore, the dominant word order cannot be conclusively determined as one of the standard fixed orders.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, there is limited direct information about the dominant word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. However, some clues can be inferred from the text.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""The order of the word parts remain the same in the negative as it is in the declarative sentence,"" but it does not specify what that order is.
2. **Paragraph 10** states that ""They do not require changes in word order in the sentence as in English,"" suggesting that word order is relatively fixed, but again, it does not specify the order.
3. **Paragraph 11** discusses the placement of prefixes and the identification of the subject and object but does not provide clear examples of full sentences with both subject and object nouns.
4. **Paragraph 19** mentions that ""the active verb describes an action that is performed by the subject,"" which aligns with typical SVO or SOV structures but does not confirm the specific order.
5. **Paragraph 27** and **Paragraph 28** provide some information about verb forms and sentence structures but do not clarify the dominant word order.

Given the lack of explicit examples or statements about the dominant word order in the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to definitively determine the dominant word order for Arikara from this information alone.

**Reasoning:**
- The paragraphs do not provide clear examples or explicit statements about the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences with both noun participants.
- The information given is more focused on verb forms, prefixes, and general sentence structure without specifying the order of S, O, and V.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of the dominant word order (SOV, SVO, etc.) in Takelma. The paragraphs primarily discuss various aspects of the language's morphology, phonology, and syntax, but none of them provide clear examples or descriptions of the typical order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Paragraphs discuss verb morphology, suffixes, and inflectional characteristics.
   - Examples of verb forms and their uses are given, but they do not clearly indicate the dominant word order.
   - The information provided is more focused on the structure and formation of words rather than sentence structure.
   - There is no clear pattern or explicit statement about the order of subject, object, and verb in the sentences provided.

2. **Conclusion**: Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Jemez,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""Mary gya John be16 Q-0-h6"" (Mary rep John bread tben[3sg:3sg]-basbake/pf)
   - Analysis: This example shows the structure ""Mary John bread bake,"" which follows the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 25**:
   - Example: ""d6- S6- tat&&"" (I punched that man.)
   - Analysis: This example translates to ""I that man punched,"" which also follows the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 40**:
   - Example: ""v&la dPli f&"" (A man killed a chicken.)
   - Analysis: This example translates to ""A man chicken killed,"" which follows the SOV order.

These examples consistently show the subject (S) preceding the object (O), followed by the verb (V), indicating that the dominant word order in Jemez is SOV.

### Reasoning:
The examples provided from the grammar consistently show sentences where the subject comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb. This pattern is observed in multiple instances, suggesting that SOV is the dominant word order in Jemez.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Zuni,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions that focus movement restores SOV order and that OSV word order occurs in other clauses. This indicates that SOV might be a basic order, but OSV can also occur.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: States that the word order of Zuni clauses containing at least a pronominal object argument is OSV, contrasting with the SOV order found with only lexical NP arguments. This suggests that SOV is the basic order when both subject and object are nouns.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Reinforces that OSV is the unmarked order when pronouns are involved, implying that SOV is the basic order otherwise.

4. **Paragraph 10**: Clearly states that Zuni word order is strict SOV, with the verb appearing finally in its clause and arguments not undergoing scrambling movement.

5. **Paragraph 24**: Reiterates that the verb occurs finally and strictly so, which aligns with an SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 46**: Provides an example of SOV order: ""ho'cana‘awa-kya"" (I found the child), where the subject precedes the object and the verb appears at the end.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Zuni is SOV.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Rama,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that Rama is an SOV language and that the word order is relatively rigid. This is a strong indicator of the dominant word order in Rama.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph also mentions the SOV word order of the language, reinforcing the information provided in Paragraph 1.

3. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph states that Rama is a verb-final language, which is consistent with an SOV word order.

4. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph mentions that Rama is a verb-final language, which aligns with the SOV word order.

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides examples of SOV word order in Rama, further confirming the dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 48**: This paragraph explicitly states that Rama is an SOV language, although it is not strictly verb-final as some elements can appear post-verbally.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tonkawa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tonkawa, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - ""The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject, object and verb.""
   - This explicitly states that the typical word order is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - ""This sentence illustrates the usual word order in Tonkawa: subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal verb.""
   - This reinforces the SOV order, with additional modifiers and subordinated verbs fitting into the structure.

3. **Paragraph 7:**
   - Example sentence: ""'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o' The bad dog severely bit a big man.""
   - Here, 'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la' (the bad dog) is the subject, 'ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak' (a big man) is the object, and 'nadj-o' (bit) is the verb, following the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 10:**
   - Example sentence: ""da'ane-da ha'na-la he took it and, going off, ...""
   - This example shows a compound sentence but maintains the SOV structure within its clauses.

5. **Paragraph 11:**
   - Example sentence: ""da'ane-da ha'na-la he took it and, going off, ...""
   - This example shows a compound sentence but maintains the SOV structure within its clauses.

6. **Paragraph 18:**
   - Example sentence: ""da'ane-da ha'na-la he took it and, going off, ...""
   - This example shows a compound sentence but maintains the SOV structure within its clauses.

From these examples and explanations, it is clear that the dominant word order in Tonkawa is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract several key points about the word order in Tunica:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the independent object normally follows the independent subject if both are expressed in the same clause. This suggests an SOV structure.
   
2. **Paragraph 6** indicates a tendency to place the predicative word (verb) at the end of the sentence or clause, which aligns with an SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 31** provides an example where the main clause takes the sentence-final position, and the predicative word (verb) is at the end, supporting an SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 23** shows examples where the subject precedes the object and the verb, reinforcing the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 28** suggests that non-locative predicate modifiers have considerable freedom in placement, but this does not contradict the SOV order for the main constituents (subject, object, verb).

6. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 11** discuss the linking of verb stems and the order of events, but these do not directly contradict the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Tunica is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).",sov,sov
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Wappo by focusing on the position of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the position of personal pronouns, indicating that pronominal subjects precede objects and typically appear before the verb. This suggests a tendency towards SOV order when pronouns are involved.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Provides several examples of sentences. For instance:
   - ""he'ku mai'hotco'halanuma?"" (Is this where one walks along?)
   - ""tu'pulu e'yEma tet'u'tvknoma, tse i'si mul tc*aki'lta"" (then her beaded belt that she had wrapped around herself, that we took off)
   - ""tse'te an t'o'enama"" (by means of that he kills people)
   - ""pa't*a tse k'e'tci te-ole'oknoma tc'ak'e'tcittsta"" (and he cut them where they were tied)

   These examples show a pattern where the verb appears at the end of the sentence, suggesting an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the order of suffixes and the structure of verbs, indicating a complex verb morphology but does not directly address the order of subject and object relative to the verb.

   - ""tse'pi k-a'naci po'le ne'eke"" (he the Indian had a boy)
   - ""o'na eole'kuma make'kdta me'yu"" (again he threw the fish-line in the water)

   These examples consistently show the verb at the end of the sentence, reinforcing the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 43**: Discusses case formation and mentions that the objective is the stem itself, but does not provide direct evidence of word order.

7. **Paragraph 44**: Discusses the expression of plurality in verbs but does not provide direct evidence of word order.

Nuuchahnulth,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""The predicate usually comes first in the clause followed by the core (i.e. subject and object) RPs in either order.""
   - Example (180)c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees the baby.""
   - Example (180)d: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees him/her/it.""

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (167): ""c@brF`QrHbtW"" translates to ""I [SUBJ] see you (sg.) [OBJ].""
   - Example (168): ""cTvhpr@jrHbtW"" translates to ""You [OBLIQUE] (sg.) are my [SUBJ] father.""

3. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (229)b: ""vhF`jRhQhsFh G@ji@Q"" translates to ""the girl who had gotten angry.""
   - Example (229)g: ""rtrDFh pi`x`BHj"" translates to ""a swimming wolf.""

   - Example (197)b: ""ghmHrhQ@ ghC`l` G`VhK"" translates to ""Again I gave torches to the chiefs.""
   - Example (197)c: ""g`K@ChQ [O`sp@v`LhmGhsFh G`xt G@VHG`Q] ji@s@"" translates to ""He paid a quarter each to the ten men who had packed the goods.""

5. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example (220)b: ""O`sY`GrF`Q`G E`o`brhr"" translates to ""I have freight in my canoe.""

6. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example (185)e: ""BhprhO`Q E`F`j IhlRr`bFh"" translates to ""Kwatyat poured water into the boiling box.""

### Analysis:

From the examples provided, we observe the following patterns:

- **Verb-Initial Sentences**: The verb often appears at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the subject and object in various orders.
  - Example (180)c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" (Verb-Subject-Object)
  - Example (197)b: ""ghmHrhQ@ ghC`l` G`VhK"" (Verb-Object-Subject)

- **Flexibility in Subject and Object Order**: The subject and object can appear in either order after the verb.
  - Example (180)c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" (Verb-Subject-Object)
  - Example (197)c: ""g`K@ChQ [O`sp@v`LhmGhsFh G`xt G@VHG`Q] ji@s@"" (Verb-Object-Subject)

- **Predicate-Initial Clauses**: The predicate (verb) usually comes first, followed by the core arguments (subject and object) in either order.
  - Example (185)e: ""BhprhO`Q E`F`j IhlRr`bFh"" (Verb-Object-Subject)

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nuuchahnulth appears to be **Verb-Initial** (V-initial), with flexibility in the order of the subject and object. This suggests that the language does not have a rigid SVO or SOV structure but rather a preference for starting sentences with the verb, followed by the subject and object in either order.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Columbia-Wenatchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin) can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the direct object ""ttw’it"" (boy) appears immediately following the predicate, and the subject ""kiy’dna?"" (girl) is in the final position, representing the unmarked word order VOS.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: It explicitly states that when overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the examples.

3. **Paragraph 4**: It reiterates that simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive sentences and the unmarked VOS for transitive clauses, noting that VSO constructions are also possible.

4. **Paragraph 5**: It confirms that VOS appears to be the unmarked order in the language, even though there is some freedom of word order.

5. **Paragraph 6**: It mentions that VSO ordering is not as frequent as VOS but is possible nonetheless.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while there is some flexibility in word order, the unmarked or dominant word order for transitive clauses in Columbia-Wenatchi is VOS.

### Conclusion:
VOS",vos,vos
Hidatsa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Hidatsa by examining the structure of transitive clauses where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. The most relevant information is found in Paragraph 1, which explicitly discusses the unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph states: ""The unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons.""
   - Here, ""A"" stands for Agent, which is equivalent to the subject (S) in the context of word order typology.
   - ""O"" stands for Object, and ""V"" stands for Verb.
   - Therefore, the unmarked (or basic) word order in Hidatsa is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Additional Supporting Information**:
   - Other paragraphs provide context about the flexibility and strategies for disambiguation in Hidatsa, but they do not contradict the primary information given in Paragraph 1. For example, Paragraph 2 mentions the use of word order to disambiguate direct objects from indirect objects, reinforcing the importance of word order in the language.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the explicit statements and examples given in the text.

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states: ""the default order is SOV."" This is a clear indication of the dominant word order in Aghu.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** supports this by stating: ""Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb."" This reinforces the SOV order as the norm for the language.

3. **Paragraph 1** mentions that there are exceptions where the object precedes the subject, but these are noted as deviations from the norm and are influenced by factors such as topicality. This suggests that while there are variations, they are not the dominant pattern.

4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** do not provide direct information about the dominant word order but focus on other aspects of clause structure and word lists.

5. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss the use of overt subjects and objects, but again, they do not contradict the SOV order mentioned earlier.

6. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** discuss experiential constructions and modifiers, which do not directly affect the basic word order determination.

Manambu,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Manambu, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the examples and explanations given regarding the structure of sentences, the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs, and the syntactic and pragmatic motivations behind constituent order.

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the structure of major constituents and mentions that the order of constituents is fixed with the predicate always coming last. This suggests a verb-final tendency.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: Explicitly states that constituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb-final in main clauses and almost exclusively so in dependent clauses. Examples provided (e.g., ""AOV"" and ""OAV"" orders) reinforce the verb-final structure.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, such as ""I will not hit you"" (AOV) and ""I will not hit you"" (OAV), indicating that the verb-final order is a strong tendency.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the frequent order of modifiers in a noun phrase but does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses grammatical relations and cross-referencing on verbs, indicating that the subject and object can be cross-referenced, but does not provide explicit examples of word order.

6. **Paragraph 7**: Summarizes the properties of clause types and mentions that constituent order is not necessarily fixed in main clauses but is almost always fixed in dependent clauses, again suggesting a verb-final tendency.

7. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of sentences with verb-final order, such as ""You are not going to fall down"" (negative same-subject purposive) and ""I do not want to eat with them"" (negative desiderative).

8. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the structure of noun phrases and the placement of modifiers but does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb.

9. **Paragraph 10**: Summarizes the properties of copula clauses, verbless clauses, and clauses with non-verbal predicates, indicating that the order is subject-predicate, which aligns with a verb-final structure in verbal clauses.

10. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses complex predicates and their fixed order, reinforcing the verb-final tendency.

11. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions that the order of components in complex predicates is fixed and that they are verb-final.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can deduce the dominant word order in Motuna by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""Word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors."" It also states that ""SV, OAV, and AOV are commonly found constituent orders in my corpus."" This suggests that the verb typically appears at the end of the clause, indicating a preference for verb-final structures.

2. **Paragraph 3** provides a table of basic word order in transitive verbal clauses, showing examples such as:
   - O(ABS) A(ERG) V
   - A(ERG) O(ABS) V
   - A(ABS) O(ABS) V
   - O(ABS) V
   - A(ERG) V
   - V (with unexpressed A or O)
   
   These examples reinforce the observation that the verb tends to appear at the end of the clause, supporting a verb-final order.

3. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that the basic word order and case markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses are such that the verb typically comes last.

4. **Paragraph 8** states that when A is in ergative case, word order is free, but when A is in absolutive case, A must precede O. This flexibility does not contradict the verb-final tendency.

5. **Paragraph 17** discusses the structure of verb stems and their suffixes, which further supports the verb-final structure by showing how verbs are morphologically complex and typically appear at the end of clauses.

Dla (Menggwa),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Menggwa Dla (Dla) can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph states that ""Most clauses are verb-final, and the order amongst the free constituents (noun phrases and other words) before the verb is free."" This suggests a tendency towards SOV order since the verb typically comes at the end of the clause.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the verb follows the (pro)nominals. For instance, ""yo=pa ilohe"" (Only I work here) and ""hwifiha-hya-aØ-numb-a-mbo"" (I fetch water, and...). These examples support the verb-final tendency.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph reiterates that ""Clauses are most usually verb-final,"" reinforcing the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides examples where the object precedes the subject, but it also mentions that the order of the object and subject nominals can be interchanged freely. However, the verb remains at the end, supporting the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph states that ""Clauses are predominantly verb-final,"" further confirming the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph mentions that the head noun in relative clauses cannot take the object case clitic, indicating that the verb typically follows the noun phrases, aligning with the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph discusses the use of the object case clitic =mbo and provides examples where the object precedes the verb, such as ""hofowali(=mbo) sama-Ø-ya-a-mbo"" (S/he cooked the bandicoot, and...). This supports the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph provides examples of noun phrases and their modifiers, indicating that the verb typically follows these constituents, aligning with the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Duna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the typical ordering of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph provides a clear overview of the typical word order in Duna. It states that subject argument NPs are clause-initial, object NPs typically follow subject NPs, and the verb comes after the objects. This is represented in Figure 4.1:
     ```
     (NPsubject) (NPobject) Verb
     ```
   - This indicates an SOV word order.

2. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph discusses marked word order constructions and mentions that subjects typically precede other constituents in unmarked order. This further supports the idea that the subject comes first in the typical word order.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of sentences with the typical word order. For instance:
     ```
     khunu ho-ra-ka ita-nasa-ya...
     3PL here-SHRD-PLC pig-SPEC strike-DEP
     ```
   - This example shows the subject (3PL) preceding the object (pig-SPEC) and the verb (strike-DEP), which aligns with the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph discusses the position of oblique NPs and mentions that they typically follow the subject argument NP if one is present. This reinforces the idea that the subject comes first, followed by other elements.

5. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of object-verb predications, showing that the object typically precedes the verb, which is consistent with an SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 16**:
   - This paragraph summarizes the typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause, represented in Figure 4.2:
     ```
     (NPsubject) (ObliqueCircum.) (NPobject) (ObliquePartic.) Predicate
     ```
   - This again supports the SOV word order.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can analyze the word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Word order is highly variable and quite free, although some other languages in the family have a weak preference for Subject/Object/Verb.""
   - ""Word order in Yimas is remarkably free, even in comparison to the relative freedom exhibited by other Papuan languages.""
   - ""Within the clause, there is no set word order pattern at all.""
   - ""The verb has a slight tendency to occur last in a pragmatically unmarked context, with the preceding nominals in any order.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Examples show different orders of subject, object, and verb:
     - ""panmal narma!J na-n-tay"" can mean either 'The man saw the woman' or 'The woman saw the man.'
     - ""kray!J narma!J k-n-tay"" unambiguously means 'The woman saw the frog.'

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""The word order of the nouns in Yimas is free, so order does not signal their syntactic functions as it does in English.""
   - Examples:
     - ""narmau namat pu-n-tu-t"" ('The woman killed the men.')
     - ""narmau namat na-mpu-tu-t"" ('The men killed the woman.')

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""Although the verb tends to occur finally, word order is quite free in most of them (Murik may be an exception, but information is insufficient to decide).""

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The only obligatory constituent of a clause in Yimas is a verb.""
   - Examples show various orders:
     - ""marmp-n kay i-ka-ak-mpi-wul"" ('I pushed the canoe into the water.')
     - ""kay marmp-n i-ka-ak-mpi-wul"" ('I pushed the canoe into the water.')
     - ""kay i-ka-ak-mpi-wul marmp-n"" ('I pushed the canoe into the water.')
     - ""marmp-n i-ka-ak-mpi-wul kay"" ('I pushed the canoe into the water.')

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""A clause with both nominals following the verb (i.e., a verb-initial structure) is perfectly grammatical, but is a bit more marked pragmatically than the above examples.""
   - Examples:
     - ""panmal kay i-n-yamal"" ('The man made a canoe.')
     - ""kay panmal i-n-yamal"" ('The man made a canoe.')
     - ""kay i-n-yamal panmal"" ('The man made a canoe.')
     - ""i-n-yamal panmal kay"" ('The man made a canoe.')

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""Yimas clauses are normally just a string of words.""
   - Example:
     - ""a!Jkayapan patn ama-na-kn mama-k-n kalakn na-n-kpuc-t nam-n"" ('In the afternoon, the boy chewed my rotten betelnut in the house.')

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - ""Although the verb tends to occur finally, word order is quite free in most of them.""

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""The syntactic cohesion of sentences in all Lower Sepik languages is remarkably loose.""

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - ""Word order is quite free in most of them.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, Yimas exhibits a highly flexible word order with no dominant order of subject, object, and verb. The verb tends to occur at the end of the clause, but this is not a strict rule, and other orders are also grammatically acceptable.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kanum (Ngkâlmpw), we can analyze the word order in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Ngkolmpu is largely a verb-final language,"" and in pragmatically neutral circumstances, there is a strong tendency to order the constituents AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). This directly points to an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure when considering the subject as the agent.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions that word order is flexible and influenced by pragmatic constraints such as topicality, animacy, and argument saliency. However, it also notes that word order is too flexible to be a reliable diagnostic. This suggests variability but does not contradict the dominant SOV order indicated in Paragraph 2.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with an SOV structure:
   - ""Markus pr pi storui"" translates to ""Markus cut the log,"" where ""Markus"" is the subject, ""pr pi"" (the log) is the object, and ""storui"" (cut) is the verb.

4. **Paragraph 14** discusses cognate-object constructions, which involve two absolutive arguments and the middle form of the verb. The examples provided show the verb at the end, consistent with an SOV structure:
   - ""ngko aeibentai teibentai"" translates to ""I told the story,"" where ""ngko"" (I) is the subject, ""aeibentai"" (the story) is the object, and ""teibentai"" (told) is the verb.

5. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of interrogative sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with an SOV structure:
   - ""mne krar Markus srampui?"" translates to ""Which dog bit Markus?"" where ""mne krar"" (which dog) is the subject, ""Markus"" is the object, and ""srampui"" (bit) is the verb.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) is **SOV**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Maybrat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph mentions that ""Some characteristics shared by all the WPP languages of the Bird’s Head are their SVO word order."" It explicitly states that Maybrat has an SVO word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Asmat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Asmat can be inferred from the following observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the order of suffixes indicating the category, object, and subject in verbs. This indicates that verbs can carry information about both the subject and the object through suffixes, which might suggest a flexible word order in sentences.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Lists various forms of verbs with different subject and object suffixes, showing that verbs are highly inflected for both subject and object. This again suggests that the language might not rely heavily on word order to convey grammatical relationships, as these are marked on the verb itself.

3. **Paragraph 7**: Provides examples of imperative forms and their object categories, showing that verbs can take different suffixes depending on the object. This further supports the idea that Asmat uses verb morphology to indicate grammatical roles.

4. **Paragraph 20**: Describes the structure of verbal forms, indicating that verbs can be heavily inflected with prefixes and suffixes to convey different grammatical categories, including subject and object. This suggests that word order might be less rigid.

5. **Paragraph 41**: Mentions that verbs can be linked with substantives, proper names, personal pronouns, and demonstrative pronouns, but does not specify a fixed order for these elements in a sentence.

6. **Paragraph 42**: Discusses the independence of the core and peripheral parts of verbs, indicating that verbs can carry a lot of grammatical information independently of word order.

7. **Paragraph 43**: Provides examples of verbs with different suffixes indicating subject and object, showing that verbs can encode a lot of grammatical information.

8. **Paragraph 44**: Mentions that verbs can be prefixed and suffixed in various ways, further indicating that word order might be flexible.

9. **Paragraph 45**: Lists various forms of verbs with different subject and object suffixes, showing that verbs can carry a lot of grammatical information.

10. **Paragraph 46**: Describes the division of verbs into different categories based on subject and object suffixes, indicating that verbs can encode a lot of grammatical information.

11. **Paragraph 47**: Lists various forms of verbs with different subject and object suffixes, showing that verbs can carry a lot of grammatical information.

12. **Paragraph 48**: Describes the structure of verbs and their ability to take various prefixes and suffixes, indicating that verbs can encode a lot of grammatical information.

13. **Paragraph 49**: Lists various forms of verbs with different subject and object suffixes, showing that verbs can carry a lot of grammatical information.

14. **Paragraph 50**: Describes the structure of verbs and their ability to take various prefixes and suffixes, indicating that verbs can encode a lot of grammatical information.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The extensive use of verb morphology to indicate subject and object roles suggests that Asmat does not rely heavily on a fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships. Instead, the language appears to have a flexible word order, with verbs carrying much of the grammatical information through their inflections. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Asmat has no dominant word order.",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Kuot,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a detailed grammatical overview of Kuot, including the structure of verb phrases and the ordering of cross-referencing affixes and clitics on verbs.

Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Imonda by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""As far as clause constituent order is concerned, there is only one constraint, namely the requirement for the verb to occur in final position.""
   - This indicates that the verb (V) must be at the end of the clause, suggesting a verb-final structure.

2. **Examples from Paragraph 2**:
   - (54) SU-OB: ""ka pafeia suefe-i1"" (I am going to make a fire)
   - (55) OB-SU: ""ne-m ka lapi fe-f"" (I will shoot you)
   - (57) OB-BEN-SU: ""6h-nki ne-m ka f - i a -na - t a -me"" (shall I get this one for you?)
   - (58) ADV-SU-OB: ""hai f 6 ehe-fed-nki pinisim f e"" (she finished that again)
   - (59) SU-OB-ADV: ""ka ne-m h a i f 6 ah-t6g6 eg - l a -m-6"" (why should I follow you again)

   These examples show flexibility in the order of subject (S) and object (O), but consistently place the verb (V) at the end.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""The order of elements within the NP and the clause is fairly flexible.""
   - Despite the flexibility, the verb-final constraint is reiterated.

4. **Additional Examples**:
   - (60) ""mag-na -nam-fa,aia-1ag6-1-ie -uagl-ual-n"" (some other time, his father and his wife went away)
   - (61) ""mgna-iaheual-18h-fna, sebuhe-faroad-LOC hear -stand-PRO ghost -TO"" (he stood listening on the road, that ghost)
   - (62) ""mu-ial8h-n- fna , na-fav i c i n i t y -LOC S ~ ~ ~ ~ - B E N / N Ssago-TO -PRO"" (it was close by, the sago tree)

   These examples further support the verb-final structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Imonda is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). The verb consistently appears in the final position, while the subject and object can vary in their order, indicating flexibility but maintaining a verb-final constraint.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no direct information regarding the dominant word order (order of subject, object, and verb) in Nimboran. The paragraphs primarily discuss various morphological aspects of the language, such as verb forms, inflections, and categories, but they do not provide explicit examples or descriptions of declarative sentence structures involving both subject and object nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraphs on Morphology and Verb Forms**: The paragraphs extensively describe the morphological system of verbs, including categories like the Final Infinitive, Future, Present, and Past tenses, and various actor categories. However, these descriptions focus on the internal structure of verbs and their inflections rather than the syntactic arrangement of subjects, objects, and verbs in sentences.
2. **Absence of Sentence Structure Information**: None of the paragraphs explicitly mention or exemplify the arrangement of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences. The focus is more on the morphological and phonological characteristics of words and verb forms.
3. **No Examples of Full Sentences**: The provided text does not include full sentences that could be analyzed to infer the dominant word order. The examples given are mostly isolated verb forms or phrases without clear indication of their syntactic roles in a sentence.

### Conclusion:
**Not mentioned in the grammar**",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Abun can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the basic word order of an Abun clause is ""SUBJECT VERB OBJECT."" This is reinforced by the explanation that subjects are marked by their preverbal position and objects by their postverbal position. This paragraph alone provides a clear indication of the SVO word order.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that the direct object in an Abun transitive clause is encoded by word order alone and follows the verb, further supporting the SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the grammatical relations hierarchy in Abun, stating that the subject is marked by word order as preverbal and the object as postverbal, again confirming the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 4** mentions that the structure of phrases in Abun is consistent with its syntax, which uses fixed word order to signify meaning. This supports the idea of a rigid SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 7** provides an example sentence ""Isak gwa men"" (Isak hit us), which follows the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 12** contrasts Abun's rigid SVO word order with the Papuan SOV word order, indicating that Abun distinctly uses SVO.

7. **Paragraph 46** and **Paragraph 47** provide examples of transitive clauses with the structure ""SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT,"" such as ""Men gil boge-ku"" (We ate fish) and ""An nai hrek gri, an syo Isak"" (He took three plates (of food), he gave (them) to Isak), further confirming the SVO order.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Meryam Mir,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3:**
   - ""Its word order is basically A-O-V or S-V with the verb always in word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on pragmatic features.""
   - This indicates that the verb (V) is consistently in the final position, with the subject (S) and object (O) preceding it. The order can be either A-O-V (for transitive sentences) or S-V (for intransitive sentences).

2. **Paragraph 4:**
   - ""It has an A-O-V or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology.""
   - This reiterates the information from Paragraph 3, confirming that the verb is final, and the typical order for transitive sentences is A-O-V.

3. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Examples provided:
     - (5.7) ""koskiride u ikris- Ii"" (married) female-A coconutO scrape-Prlmpf
       - Translation: ""The woman is scraping a coconut.""
     - (5.10) ""ka uteb [lumi dikris- i]"" lSgA placeO weed scrape-Pf
       - Translation: ""I cleared the place.""
   - These examples show the A-O-V structure in action, with the subject (A) preceding the object (O), and both preceding the verb (V).

4. **Paragraph 8:**
   - Examples provided:
     - (5.39) ""koskiride lumi dikris-li uteb- ge"" (married) female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
       - Translation: ""The woman is clearing her place.""
     - (5.40) ""koskiride (uteb) lumi dikris-li"" (married) female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
       - Translation: ""The woman is clearing (her place).""
   - These examples further support the A-O-V structure.

Hatam,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The text mentions that ""Hatam is a rather strict (S)OV language,"" and it is possible to have an OV order. This suggests that the dominant word order is SOV, but OV is also permissible in certain contexts.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the general clause formula and mentions that Hatam allows (oblique) objects to be preposed, but it does not provide a clear indication of the dominant word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides background information on the Hatam language and its dialects. It mentions that Hatam, Sougb, and Meyah have SVO word order, but this seems to be a typological comparison rather than a specific statement about Hatam's dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph describes an example where the object is pre-posed, yielding an OV order. It supports the idea that Hatam can have OV order, but it does not contradict the earlier statement that Hatam is a strict SOV language.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the order of Genitive-Noun as a diagnostic feature but does not mention the order of subject, object, and verb.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides information on data collection and presentation but does not mention the word order.

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Kwomtari grammar shows many features typical of Papuan languages or of the Sepik region. Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and constituent order is SOV.""
   - ""Subject and object are cross-referenced by verbal suffixes...""
   - This paragraph explicitly states that the constituent order is SOV.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Iau,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Verb Final**: Paragraph 1 explicitly states that ""the verb with its associated particles always occurs clause final."" This indicates that the verb (V) is consistently placed at the end of the clause, which is a strong indicator of a verb-final language.

2. **Nouns Ordered by Topicality**: Paragraph 1 also mentions that nouns are ordered by topicality rather than grammatical function. This means that the subject (S) and object (O) can appear in either order before the verb, depending on which noun is more topical. However, the verb remains at the end of the clause.

3. **Examples**:
   - ""A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ se⁵"" (I am going to look at books) shows the verb ""see"" (doe⁷) at the end.
   - ""A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴"" and ""Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴"" both show the verb ""see"" (doe⁷) at the end, with the subject and object preceding it in varying orders based on topicality.

4. **Topicality and Definiteness**: The order of nouns (S and O) is influenced by topicality and definiteness, but the verb remains final. This is consistent across multiple examples provided in the paragraphs.

5. **Medial and Subordinate Clauses**: Paragraph 6.3.5.2 discusses the use of medial and subordinate clauses, which also end with the verb, reinforcing the verb-final structure.

6. **Pro-drop Language**: Paragraph 5 mentions that Iau is a pro-drop language, meaning that subjects and objects can be omitted when they are understood from context. However, this does not affect the position of the verb, which remains clause-final.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Iau is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on the consistent placement of the verb at the end of the clause, with the subject and object ordered by topicality before the verb.",no dominant order,sov
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karkar-Yuri, the dominant word order can be inferred from the following observations:

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Although the most unmarked word order is SOV, word order in Sentani is quite free...""
   - This indicates that while Sentani has a flexible word order, the unmarked (or most common) word order is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Thus, the most standard word order is SOV.""
   - This reinforces the information from Paragraph 1, confirming that SOV is the standard or most common word order in Sentani.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""
   - Again, this confirms that SOV is the unmarked or default word order, even though other orders are possible based on information structure.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""
   - This is consistent with the previous paragraphs, indicating that SOV is the default order.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""
   - This further confirms the dominant word order as SOV.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""

   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""
   - This further confirms the dominant word order as SOV.

10. **Paragraph 11**:
    - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""
    - This is consistent with the previous information, reinforcing that SOV is the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Mpur,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Mpur can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.""
2. **Paragraph 11** mentions: ""morphology and syntax show Austronesian features (Reesink 1998:603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order and the absence of heavy verb morphology.""

These two paragraphs directly indicate that the dominant word order in Mpur is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can analyze the dominant word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (14): ""nanda=r gana=r re eloko-m-r"" translates to ""The big brother told the little brother.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (older.brother=M younger.brother=M 3SG.M.OBJ tell-PAST2-3SG.M).
   - Example (15): ""walingi num-go=t=u ka nemen ra ka tama di=r towi-wa-r"" translates to ""Some man took our crab and stacked [them] up for us.""
     - Here, the order is OSV (crab 1PL-POSS=DIM=DISC REAL 1PL.OBJ take REAL person DET=M stack-PAST1-3SG.M).
   - Example (10) and (11) show that object noun phrases can follow the verb, but this order is very uncommon.
   - It is noted that both subject and object normally precede the verb, and only rarely does the object precede the subject.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (2): ""afa=r ka mini=r te nuwa-m-r"" translates to ""[Her] father gave her betelnut.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (father=M REAL betelnut=M 3SG.F.OBJ give-PAST2-3SG.M).

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (5): ""yen=t ka rete=ka sukna-m-s"" translates to ""She put the child to sleep, the spirit did.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (child=DIM REAL put=REAL sleep-PAST2-3SG.F).
   - Example (6): ""ru aku-m-r afa=r"" translates to ""He went back, father did.""
     - Here, the order is VSO (3SG.M go.back-PAST2-3SG.M father=M).
   - Example (9): ""ka afa=r ni-ya-r ru"" translates to ""He sees [his] father.""
     - Here, the order is VOS (REAL father=M see-PRES-3SG.M 3SG.M).

4. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example (153): ""fu wi=ka nate kiri talma nate o-kwra wi=ka tiri=ka war nu=m wuya aku-m-f"" translates to ""We two went up there to clear the garden, came down to cut grass, started a fire, then went back down to go home.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (3DU go.up=REAL cut fire start cut DIST-ADV go.up=REAL leave=REAL go.down garden=PL come.down go.back-PAST2-3DU).

5. **Paragraph 24**:
   - Example (26): ""on ka me eloko-wa-yun"" translates to ""I told them.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (1SG REAL 3PL.OBJ tell-PAST1-1SG).
   - Example (28): ""mu ka tama nemen"" translates to ""They poisoned us men.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (3PL REAL person 1PL.OBJ poison).

From the examples and the analysis, it is clear that the dominant word order in Mehek is **SOV**. Although there are instances of other orders (like OSV and VSO), these are noted to be rare or marked, and the typical structure involves the subject and object preceding the verb.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Abui,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that Stokhof (1984) claims the basic constituent order to be SOV. This is a direct statement about the dominant word order in Abui.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the verb occurs in the final position, with the arguments preceding the verb. Specifically, it shows sentences where the subject (S) and object (O) precede the verb (V), which aligns with the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph includes examples of sentences where the verb occurs at the end, such as ""ama sieng nee"" (person rice eat) and ""fala fak-i"" (house break-PFV). These examples further support the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that Abui has a basic Actor-Undergoer-Verb (AUV) constituent order, which is another way of describing the SOV order, with the actor (subject) and undergoer (object) preceding the verb.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly mentions that the word order in Abu is subject-verb-object (SVO):
   - ""This morphological ordering occurs subject-verb-object (S-V-O). This ordering is obligatory, and it makes Abu' different from most Papuan languages, whose word ordering is typically manifested by an A-U-V or S-O-V ordering.""

2. **Paragraph 5** reinforces this by stating:
   - ""This syntactic ordering is also found with free object noun phrases. A pervasive feature of many of the Papuan languages of Papua New Guinea is overt case marking, a feature that is not found in Abu'. The absence of any overt case marking morphemes are compensated for by the strict S-V-O grammatical word order.""

3. **Paragraph 24** provides an example of a sentence structure:
   - ""emi Consider the following examples: n-a-ha 3SGN -R -hit -3SGF(Obj) 'Who hit her'.""
   - This example shows a subject-verb-object structure, even though it is in an interrogative form, it follows the SVO pattern.

4. **Paragraph 50** provides a clear example of a simple declarative sentence:
   - ""11. aleman ubahi-n-e-r-i n-a-ha bul kani walub. man big -NCE(man)-EC-AP 3SGM(A)-R-kill pig PP(LOC) river 'The big man killed a pig at the river'.""
   - Here, the sentence structure is SVO: ""The big man (subject) killed (verb) a pig (object) at the river.""

5. **Paragraph 43** discusses transitive clauses and provides an example:
   - ""27. kw-a-ha nubat 3SGFA -R-hit/kill dog 'She hit/killed a dog.'""
   - This example also follows the SVO structure.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) is subject-verb-object (SVO).

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Korafe,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Korafe can be determined by examining the syntactic structure and the order of constituents in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""SOY represents the unmarked order of core constituents in transitive verbal clauses,"" although it also mentions that other configurations like OSV, SVO, and OVS can occur due to pragmatic constraints. However, the unmarked or default order is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that ""Korafe standard NPs are not found with more than four modifying constituents and do not usually occur with more than two."" It also mentions that the structure of the standard noun phrase aligns with the universals suggested for SOV languages.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph mentions that ""the unmarked order of core constituents in the clause is subject-object-verb (SOV),"" but also notes that word order is fairly free with the stipulation that the verb be last.

4. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the topicalization of the object and the assignment of focus to the subject in OSV-ordered clauses. However, it also confirms that SOV is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause.

5. **Paragraph 25**: This paragraph identifies the subject by cross-referencing for person and number on the final verb in the clause, following a nominative-accusative pattern, which is typical for SOV languages.

6. **Paragraph 33**: This paragraph mentions that the initial argument in a clause usually has TOPIC function and sometimes coincides with the subject because the unmarked order of constituents in Korafe verbal clauses is SOV.

7. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph discusses the negative focus marker and the combination of negative deverbal forms, which provides a strategy for circumventing the iconic order restriction that SRCs adhere to. It mentions that the default assumption is that the speaker is depicting the events involved in iconic order, which aligns with SOV structure.

8. **Paragraph 35**: This paragraph states that Korafe verbs function as the only obligatory constituent in clauses or simple sentences, usually occurring clause-finally, which is consistent with SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Alamblak can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraph 12 explicitly states: ""The basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in ordering.""
   - Paragraph 32 supports this by stating: ""The basic word order of a Two-place Clause is SOV; however, it is flexible. The object may follow the predicate with or without the presence of the subject. The object may precede the subject for pragmatic reasons.""
   - Paragraph 42 also mentions: ""Included there is a resumé of the general features of Alamblak, most of which are implied by its basic SOV word order.""
   - Paragraph 8 mentions: ""There are certain departures in Alamblak from some of the generalizations made by Greenberg for SOV languages,"" which implies that Alamblak generally follows SOV order but has some exceptions.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that the dominant word order in Alamblak is SOV, even though there is some flexibility and exceptions based on pragmatic factors.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 7** explicitly states: ""The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOV, with Oblique participants (including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the verb.""
   - **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 5** provide examples of word order in interrogative clauses and focus positions, but these are not directly relevant to determining the dominant word order in declarative sentences.
   - **Paragraph 9** mentions deviations from the word order for pragmatic reasons but confirms the existence of a dominant order.
   - **Paragraph 10** discusses non-verbal predicates, indicating that the subject precedes the predicate, aligning with an SOV structure.
   - **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 27** provide examples of subject and object placement in sentences, reinforcing the SOV structure.
   - **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 31** discuss verb morphology and clause chaining, which indirectly support the SOV structure by showing how verbs and objects interact in sentences.

Given these points, the dominant word order in I'saka is clearly SOV.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language."" It further elaborates that the position of the subject is very fixed and cannot be moved after the verb in most clause types. This rigidity in word order is crucial for distinguishing grammatical functions due to the lack of morphological case markings.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the rigidity of word order in Urim, stating that ""Word order in Urim is basically very rigid"" and that ""Subjects almost always occur before the verb in Urim clause."" It also mentions that objects can be fronted but this is rare, further supporting the SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph describes the structure of experience clauses, which follow the pattern NP + NP + V, aligning with the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses semitransitive clauses, which also follow the SVO structure, with two obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb.

5. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph describes locative clauses, which maintain a rigid word order with the subject always occurring before the verb and the locative object after it, consistent with SVO.

6. **Paragraph 27**: This paragraph discusses monotransitive clauses, which have an obligatory direct object and follow the SVO structure, with the subject as the agent and the object as the patient.

7. **Paragraph 37**: This paragraph mentions that moving the subject after the verb is rare and typically occurs only in specific clause types or topic constructions, reinforcing the dominance of the SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 40**: This paragraph describes existence clauses, which can have the subject after the verb, but this is an exception rather than the norm, indicating that the basic word order remains SVO.

9. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph discusses left-dislocated subjects, which are common in Urim and usually represented by a coreferring pronoun within the sentence, maintaining the SVO structure.

10. **Paragraph 44**: This paragraph describes the introduction of new participants and referents in discourse, often using full noun phrases with the demonstrative pa, which aligns with the SVO order.

11. **Paragraph 45**: This paragraph discusses tracking participants and maintaining topics using pronouns and zero-anaphora, which supports the SVO structure by maintaining the subject before the verb.

12. **Paragraph 46**: This paragraph describes left dislocation and topic constructions, which are common in Urim and typically involve the subject occurring before the verb, consistent with SVO.

13. **Paragraph 47**: This paragraph describes verb plus demonstrative adverb constructions, which maintain the subject before the verb, supporting the SVO order.

14. **Paragraph 48**: This paragraph discusses the use of pa with pronouns to mark changing topics, which aligns with the SVO structure by maintaining the subject before the verb.

15. **Paragraph 49**: This paragraph describes the use of pa with pronouns to mark changing topics, which supports the SVO order by maintaining the subject before the verb.

16. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph discusses complex sentences, which include subordinate clauses functioning as arguments, modifiers of nouns, and modifiers of verb phrases, all of which align with the SVO structure.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Abau grammar, the dominant word order in Abau can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that the normal order in Abau is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). It mentions that the neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can be altered for pragmatic reasons. The examples provided also follow the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that the verbal clause in Abau follows SOV order by default and displays the syntactic marking of subject and object.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that the most common order within Abau is SOV, although it can be changed to OSV for pragmatic reasons. However, the default or neutral order is SOV.

4. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides a typological overview of Abau, stating that the default ordering of arguments is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

5. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of subject and object, stating that the neutral or frequently observed order within the clause places the subject before the object, with the verb phrase occurring clause-finally, which aligns with the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph discusses relative clauses and mentions that the relative clause follows SOV order, reinforcing the default SOV order in Abau.

7. **Paragraph 31**: This paragraph discusses relative clauses following the head noun and mentions that the relative clause follows SOV order, further supporting the SOV order in Abau.

8. **Paragraph 36**: This paragraph discusses the structure of the verb phrase and mentions that the verb phrase occurs clause-finally, which is consistent with the SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph discusses verbal clauses and mentions that the verbal clause follows SOV order by default.

10. **Paragraph 39**: This paragraph discusses object NP markers and mentions that the object NP follows the subject NP, with the verb phrase occurring clause-finally, which aligns with the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Chamorro by analyzing the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - Chamorro is described as a predicate-first language. The dominant word order in neutral clauses is Predicate Subject Object Obliques.
   - Example: ""Ha po’lu ta’lu tåtti si nanå-hu i låta gi papa’ i hagun gålak."" (My mother put the can back again under the galak leaf.)

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The word order of arguments is flexible when the predicate is a verb or adjective.
   - Example: ""Ha latchai i na’-ña i taotåo."" (The man had consumed his food.)

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The dominant word order for clauses with a verb or adjective as the predicate is Predicate Subject Object Obliques.
   - Example: ""Ha apåpasi i lalåhi singku pesus si Carmen."" (Carmen is paying the men five dollars.)

4. **Paragraph 8**:
   - The word order Predicate Subject Object is strongly preferred or required in cases of potential ambiguity.
   - Example: ""Ha apåpasi i lalåhi singku pesus si Carmen."" (Carmen is paying the men five dollars.)

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - The subject can follow the direct object but precede obliques, giving the word order: Predicate Object Subject Obliques.
   - Example: ""Ha dåggåo i bola guatu gi taotåo i patgun."" (The child threw the ball to the man.)

6. **Paragraph 16**:
   - The subject can occur at the right edge of the clause, so that the word order is: Predicate Object Obliques Subject.
   - Example: ""Ha dåggåo i patgun i bola guatu gi taotåo."" (The child threw the ball to the man.)

7. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Antipassive clauses have the same word order options as other intransitive clauses. Usually, the subject occurs immediately after the verb.
   - Example: ""Mamumulan famagu’un si Antonio på’gu gi egga’an."" (Antonio is watching the children this morning.)

8. **Paragraph 48**:
   - Causative clauses are ordinary transitive clauses in many respects. The dominant word order is: Verb Subject Object Other.
   - Example: ""Ha na’bula siboyas gi cha’lak i katni."" (I put lots of onions in the small cut of the meat.)

From these points, it is clear that while Chamorro allows for some flexibility in word order, the dominant and most frequently occurring word order in neutral declarative sentences is Predicate Subject Object (PSO). This is consistently mentioned across multiple paragraphs and examples.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Awtuw's basic word order is readily identifiable as verb final, indeed as SOV."" This is a clear indication that the dominant word order in Awtuw is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 7** discusses reflexive constructions and mentions that ""The word order in reflexive clauses is rigidly S REFL (O) V,"" which aligns with an SOV structure, reinforcing the verb-final nature of the language.

3. **Paragraph 9** mentions that ""constituent order within a clause carries no information about the case roles of the nominal constituents,"" suggesting some flexibility in word order but does not contradict the basic SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 11** states that ""constituents in a yes-no question have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence,"" indicating flexibility but not providing a different dominant order.

5. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with an SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 17** defines grammatical relations and mentions that the subject never takes object marking, which is typical in SOV languages where the subject is often unmarked.

Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can determine the dominant word order in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: 
   - It states that when both subject and object are full noun phrases, the unmarked constituent order is AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). 
   - This order is consistently observed in elicited examples.
   - Even though natural discourse might show some flexibility, the verb-final position is mandated.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It confirms that the unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses.
   - The verb is almost always final in any clause.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - It reiterates that unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent sentences are SV and AOV.
   - The verb must be clause-final.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - For ditransitive clauses, the unmarked constituent order is A R O V (Agent-Recipient-Object-Verb).

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - It mentions that head-internal relative clauses display regular clausal syntax, i.e., SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive ones.

6. **Paragraph 8**:
   - It states that the most common way of describing a reflexive situation is to replace the object of a transitive verb with a reflexive pronoun, maintaining the AOV order.

7. **Paragraph 16**:
   - It provides an example of a ditransitive verb where the order is AOV.

8. **Paragraph 23**:
   - It mentions that Mian is an SOV language, with the verb almost always being the last word in a clause.

### Conclusion:
Based on the consistent mention of the AOV order in transitive clauses and the verb-final position being mandated, it is clear that the dominant word order in Mian is **SOV**.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Chácobo can be inferred from several key points:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that objects can occur in positions 2 and 7, and that the argument which is most topical is closer to the verb. This suggests some flexibility in the order of constituents.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** states that Chácobo does not allow VPA constituent order at all and that objects can appear postverbally but are typically separated by an intonational pause, indicating that postverbal objects are not the norm.

3. **Paragraph 4** provides examples where the subject follows the verb in C-rigid constructions, indicating a VS order in some contexts.

4. **Paragraph 7** shows examples of APV and PAV orders, suggesting variability in the placement of arguments relative to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 17** provide examples of sentences where the subject follows the verb, reinforcing the presence of VS order in certain contexts.

6. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 31** discuss fronted-VP constructions and the positioning of arguments, indicating that the subject can occur in various positions relative to the verb and object.

7. **Paragraph 34** and **Paragraph 35** discuss the alignment and ordering of arguments, suggesting that there is a dedicated position for the subject after the clause-type/rank morpheme, but also indicating variability in the order of constituents.

8. **Paragraph 47** mentions that NP arguments display a neutral alignment when they occur before a lexical verb or a V̄-constituent, indicating that both A and P can variably order.

From these points, it is evident that Chácobo exhibits a significant degree of flexibility in its word order, with multiple possible orders being attested in different contexts. This flexibility suggests that there is no single dominant word order that can be identified as the primary or default order for declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Hup can be determined by examining the relative order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that the basic order of nominal arguments in transitive clauses is difficult to ascertain definitively but suggests that Hup speakers prefer AOV (Agent-Object-Verb) order.
   - Example (9a) shows ""snake jaguar kill"" (SOV).
   - Example (9b) shows ""jaguar snake kill"" (OSV), indicating flexibility but a preference for AOV.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Constituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is verb-final.
   - The basic constituent order is identified as AOV.
   - The actual order of constituents is determined primarily by pragmatics, with new information often fronted.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The order of constituents in ditransitive clauses follows similar guidelines to transitive clauses.
   - The order is governed mainly by pragmatics, but examples show flexibility in the order of objects and recipients.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Verb-final constituent order is the norm when clauses encode events that are not currently in progress.
   - Intransitive and transitive clauses are frequently initiated by an adverbial word or clause, followed by the subject, and finally the verb.

5. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Hup is described as having a basically verb-final constituent order, best characterized as AOV, although the relative order of A and O is highly flexible.

6. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Pronominal subjects almost always immediately precede the verb, resulting in a default OAV order.

7. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Constituent order in declarative clauses is generally verb-final, with the order of subject and object depending on their topicality.

8. **Paragraph 21**:
   - The order of combination of stems in compounds follows specific conventions, with the final element in a compound being the 'main' verb, supporting the verb-final nature of Hup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Hup is **AOV (Agent-Object-Verb)**. This order is supported by the preference for verb-final clauses and the flexibility in the order of subject and object, which is influenced by pragmatics and topicality.

**Conclusion: AOV**",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Kwaza,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwaza, the dominant word order in the language appears to be ""No dominant order."" Here is the reasoning:

1. **Free Word Order**: The grammar explicitly states that Kwaza has a relatively free word order, influenced mainly by pragmatic factors rather than strict syntactic rules. This is evident from the numerous examples showing different possible orders for the same sentence without a change in meaning.

2. **Examples of Variability**:
   - **Intransitive Sentences**: Both SV and VS orders are allowed.
     - Example: `'xyi-dy-hͿ 'kopu ko-'ro-tse` (""your cup is empty"") vs. `ko-'ro-tse 'xyi-dy-hͿ 'kopu` (""your cup is empty"").
   - **Transitive Sentences**: Both OV and VO orders are encountered, with both being usually allowed.
     - Example: `kreBa-'na ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki` (""I’m going to take the horse to Gleba"") vs. `kreBa-'na waja-'nã-da-ki ã'rǊi` (""I’m going to take the horse to Gleba"").
   - **Overt Subject and Object**: SVO and SOV orders are both common.
     - Example: `kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki zjwãu` (""the car killed João"") vs. `kanwã=ekai-'e zjwãu o'tsi-ki` (""the car killed João"").

3. **Consultant Remarks**: The grammar notes that alternative orders are often permitted and that the first constituent of a sentence may receive focus. This flexibility indicates that no single word order is strictly dominant.

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - **Ditransitive Sentences**: The relative position of direct and indirect objects is variable.
     - Example: `mƭu marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki` (""I gave Mario chicha to drink"") vs. `mƭu 'hai-da-ki marju-'wã` (""I gave Mario chicha to drink"").

5. **Conclusion**: Given the evidence of significant variability and the lack of a strict syntactic order, it is clear that Kwaza does not adhere to a single dominant word order.

Huambisa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa (Wampis), the dominant word order can be determined by analyzing the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The basic constituent order in Wampis is described as A P V (Agent-Patient-Verb), which translates to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) in terms of subject and object.
   - Example: ""Pujupat killed a paca"" (Pujupat kaʃai=na mãaḿ iaji) follows the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The most frequent word order in transitive constructions is Subject-Object-Verb (APV), although other orders are permitted in certain pragmatic environments.
   - Example: ""Pujupat killed a paca"" (Pujupat kaʃai=na mãaḿ iaji) follows the SOV order.

### Conclusion: SVO",no dominant order,svo
Tiriyo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order in Tiriyo:

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions that Tiriyo could be described as a ""split-word-order"" language, indicating that the preferred word order is not the same in all clause types. This suggests variability in word order depending on the clause type.

2. **Paragraph 8** discusses the syntax of Cariban languages, noting that Tiriyo is a fairly typical Cariban language. It mentions that the basic main clause types include equative and conjugated or Set I (copular, intransitive, and transitive) clauses. This indicates that there might be variability in word order across different types of clauses.

3. **Paragraph 10** provides an example of a sentence with the structure AOV, indicating that the object can precede the verb and the subject can follow the verb. This suggests that OVS order is possible in Tiriyo.

4. **Paragraph 20** states that word order appears to be pragmatically oriented and that the unmarked position is different for different clause types. It specifically mentions that habitual past clauses and remote past clauses have a clear tendency toward OVA, while conjugated sentences do not. This indicates that OVA (Object-Verb-Agent) is a common order in certain types of clauses.

5. **Paragraph 25** describes the ordering of constituents as pragmatically determined, with topical elements tending to occur in initial position. It also mentions that Tiriyo has an OV verb phrase, which suggests that the object often precedes the verb.

6. **Paragraph 32** discusses remote past clauses, noting that the A participant occurs in a postpositional phrase while the O and S participants occur as independent, non-case-marked noun phrases. This indicates an ergative-absolutive pattern, which can influence word order.

7. **Paragraph 36** provides examples of sentences with the structure AOV, further supporting the presence of OV order in Tiriyo.

8. **Paragraph 44** discusses non-verbal negation and provides examples of sentences with the structure OAV, indicating that the object can precede both the verb and the subject.

9. **Paragraph 45** provides examples of verb forms with different grades, showing that the object can precede the verb in various forms.

10. **Paragraph 50** discusses the relationship between events and participants, noting that Tiriyo is sensitive to both semantic and pragmatic dimensions. This suggests that word order can be influenced by these factors.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it appears that Tiriyo exhibits variability in word order depending on the clause type and pragmatic factors. However, there is a clear tendency toward OV (Object-Verb) order in many examples, with the subject often following the verb or object. Therefore, the dominant word order in Tiriyo can be classified as **OVS**.

**Conclusion: OVS**",ovs,ovs

42",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), the dominant word order can be determined by examining the examples and explanations given regarding the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (6.4): ""nokaeO fɨno-dɨ-o?"" (Did you make a canoe?)
   - Example (6.5): ""nokae-naO fɨno-dɨ-o?"" (Did you make the canoe?)
   - The text mentions ""the typical SV/AOV constituent order"" and the importance of constituent order when no overt morphological marking is present.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The summary reiterates that Murui has a nominative-accusative case marking system and that the constituent order is ""S, A followed by O, occur before the V."" It also mentions that the constituent order allows certain flexibility.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples (6.168) and (6.169) show the AOV order: ""ɨmeO roko-d-ePRED FlorA"" (FLOR cooks a paca) and ""nokaeO fɨno-d-ePRED [kue uzu-ma]A"" (My grandfather made A CANOE).
   - The text also mentions that the constituent order in dependent clauses is rigidly verb-final.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (12.12) shows an extended transitive clause with AOV order: ""kueA [bai-e gui-ye]O:GIFT i-t-ePRED gato-moO:RECIPIENT"" (She gave that food to the cat).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Iquito can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO. It mentions that although Iquito allows more than one possible word order, the most common and least marked word order is SVO.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reiterates that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO, especially in simple transitive clauses with full nominal phrases.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph confirms that SVO is the basic word order in realis mood, which is the default mood for declarative sentences.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph emphasizes that SVO word order appears very frequently in texts and is usually the word order that starts a discourse, further supporting it as the basic word order.

5. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph states that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO, which appears in all finite clauses with realis mood.

6. **Paragraph 32**: This paragraph provides an example of an affirmative declarative sentence in realis mood with SVO word order.

7. **Paragraph 46**: This paragraph contrasts realis and irrealis moods, noting that realis mood uses SVX (which aligns with SVO for transitive clauses).

The evidence from these paragraphs consistently points to SVO as the dominant word order in Iquito, particularly in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

### Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Movima,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph describes the hierarchical alignment system in Movima, where the word order is fixed but semantically determined. The participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded as the first core argument (ARG1), and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or inverse voice marking on the verb. This suggests that the word order is not strictly SVO, SOV, etc., but rather depends on the animacy hierarchy and voice marking.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), which suggests a tendency towards V-initial word orders like VSO or VOS. However, it does not provide specific examples or a dominant word order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in Movima. The examples (206) and (207) show verb-initial structures:
   - (206) ""n-os am~’am-wa"" (when X put me into it)
   - (207) ""yo’-na=is is kara’a bo isko an n-os, eney, am-e -wa=is n-is rim-a- e=is di’ dro:ga"" (They caught the red macaws because those, apparently, (were) for them to put in what they sold, which was drugs.)

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), which aligns with the verb-initial examples seen in Paragraph 5.

5. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph provides an example where the verb comes first:
   - ""oso’ os kawayo=y’ i di’ n-iy’ i"" (We had a horse of our own.)

6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides more examples of verb-initial structures:
   - ""jayna kas tochi'- e"" (I am not small.)
   - ""n-os tochi’- e, asko bijaw-ni:-na"" (When I was small, that (was where) I grew up.)

7. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph provides an example of a verb-initial structure:
   - ""in a kwey sal-na kweyka"" (I just looked for it.)

8. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of verb-initial structures:
   - ""jayna nis-na=is is bari=is di’ jayna pay’-but-e n-is bereya:-bun"" (Then they wiped clean their feet [of the macaws], which were smeared with tar.)

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Movima predominantly exhibits a verb-initial word order. This is supported by multiple examples where the verb appears at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the subject and object. Therefore, the dominant word order in Movima is **VSO**.

**Conclusion: VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Bora,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can deduce the dominant word order in Bora by examining the structure of sentences and the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs.

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - It mentions that Bora is an OV language and provides evidence that both Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) are common word orders.
   - This indicates that the verb typically follows the object, supporting an OV structure.

2. **Paragraph 4:**
   - Example (209): ""The dog runs."" - Subject (dog) precedes the verb (runs).
   - Example (210): ""This one (SgM) is sick."" - Subject (this one) precedes the verb (is sick).
   - These examples show that the subject precedes the verb, which aligns with SOV or OSV structures.

3. **Paragraph 5:**
   - Example (627): ""A/The chief went to hunt."" - Subject (chief) precedes the verb (went).
   - Example (628): ""Many people come."" - Subject (people) precedes the verb (come).
   - These examples reinforce that the subject precedes the verb.

4. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Example (630): ""He went to hunt."" - Subject (He) follows the verb (went).
   - This shows flexibility in subject positioning but does not contradict the OV structure.

5. **Paragraph 10:**
   - Example (846): ""He has not eaten (bread)."" - Verb (eaten) precedes the subject (He).
   - Example (847): ""He did not visit."" - Verb (visit) precedes the subject (He).
   - These examples indicate that the verb can precede the subject, suggesting flexibility but still fitting within an OV framework.

6. **Paragraph 11:**
   - Example (541): ""John knows that his dog died."" - Subject (John) precedes the verb (knows).
   - Example (542): ""John's dog bit him."" - Subject (dog) precedes the verb (bit).
   - These examples show the subject preceding the verb, consistent with SOV or OSV.

7. **Paragraph 12:**
   - Example (257): ""I caused myself to be cut."" - Subject (I) precedes the verb (caused).
   - Example (258): ""I am going to have myself treated."" - Subject (I) precedes the verb (going).
   - These examples further support the subject preceding the verb.

8. **Paragraph 13:**
   - Example (392): ""Five men come."" - Subject (men) precedes the verb (come).
   - Example (393): ""said his son"" - Verb (said) precedes the subject (his son).
   - These examples show both SOV and OSV structures.

9. **Paragraph 14:**
   - Example (627): ""A/The chief went to hunt."" - Subject (chief) precedes the verb (went).
   - Example (628): ""Many people come."" - Subject (people) precedes the verb (come).
   - These examples reinforce that the subject precedes the verb.

10. **Paragraph 15:**
    - Example (525): ""I saw him."" - Subject (I) precedes the verb (saw).
    - Example (526): ""I saw you two."" - Subject (I) precedes the verb (saw).
    - These examples show the subject preceding the verb.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Bora exhibits a dominant word order of SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by multiple examples where the subject precedes the verb, and the object precedes the verb, fitting the SOV structure.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that the most frequent constituent word order is VOS. It also mentions that although the preferred constituent order is object followed by subject, the subject occasionally precedes the object in sentences where both constituents are overtly expressed.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the VOS order by stating that the basic order of constituents in a transitive/intransitive clause is verb, object, subject. It also mentions that in a ditransitive clause, the order is verb, direct object, indirect object, subject.

3. **Paragraph 4**: It mentions that the basic order seems to be VOS and that an indirect object occurs between the direct object and the subject.

4. **Paragraph 5**: It notes that when third person NP objects are overtly expressed in sentences with certain verbs, a deviation from the normal VOS pattern occurs, and the overtly expressed subject usually precedes the object. However, this deviation is noted as an exception rather than the norm.

5. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph explicitly states that the pragmatically unmarked constituent order in Wari' is VOS. It also describes the configurations in which VOS can appear, further supporting the dominance of this word order.

### Conclusion:
**VOS**",vos,vos

Trumai,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can deduce the dominant word order in Trumai by examining the structure of declarative sentences, especially those with verbal predicates. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic or unmarked word orders for clauses with verbal predicates are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. This suggests that the dominant word order in Trumai is SOV for transitive sentences (A O V).

2. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph provides examples of word order in declarative sentences, showing that the object (O) comes before the verb (V), and the subject (A) comes before the object (O). This reinforces the SOV pattern.

3. **Paragraph 36**: This paragraph mentions that both S and O must come right before the verb when they are lexically realized, further supporting the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph discusses the basic word order for different clause types, indicating that the order for transitive clauses is [A [O V]].

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses various grammatical relations and mentions that ""The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful criterion of the identification of A and O."" This is a clear indication that SOV is a significant word order in Apinayé.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph states, ""A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in subordinate clauses) existing among them."" This further supports the presence of SOV word order in Apinayé.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph from the dissertation abstract mentions, ""Word order is predominantly SOV."" This is a direct statement confirming the dominant word order.

Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions that the order of predicates and their arguments in Yurakaré is fairly flexible, making it difficult to come up with a basic word order.
   - However, it notes a clear preference for overtly expressed subjects (both S and A) to be in the postverbal position, with preverbal subjects often having special pragmatic status.
   - This suggests a tendency towards a verb-initial order (VS or VA).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The text states that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order, and preposing a subject gives it emphasis.
   - Objects do not show a clear preference for pre- or postverbal positions.
   - The examples provided show various word orders, including VSO, VOS, SVO, and OVS.
   - The analysis of the first 85 clauses of a text shows that the verb is in either initial or second position in almost all sentences, indicating a verb-initial tendency.

**Conclusion:** VSO",no dominant order,vso
Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Kuna by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""In Kuna, the normal word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object, predicate.""
   - Example: ""An ogob kumpi."" (I coconut eat-want-to) translates to ""I want to eat coconut.""
   - This indicates an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.""
   - Example: ""Omedin we mol pakcha."" (The woman bought that blouse.)
   - This confirms the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""The subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order.""
   - Example: ""Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo."" (Pedro, you a little I want to help me.)
   - This follows the SOV pattern.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""Word order of a polite command follows normal pattern; that is to say, the additional information always precedes the verb.""
   - This implies that the verb comes last, supporting the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""If a time expression is used as an adverb to limit the scope of the action by stating when it took place (or will take place), the time expression occurs after the subject of the sentence.""
   - Example: ""Antin pan ne."" (I am going tomorrow.)
   - This does not directly indicate the order of subject, object, and verb but does not contradict the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example sentences: ""Machi ua kucha."" (The boy ate the fish.), ""Tad ua chwas."" (The elder caught fish.), ""Pun mol enukcha."" (The girl washed the clothes.)
   - These examples follow the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""In Kuna, the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate.""
   - Example: ""An abarmane."" (I run-going-to.)
   - This supports the SOV order for transitive sentences.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example: ""(Pe) neg chobgal machi imako."" (You make the boy build the house.)
   - This follows the SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Discusses adjectives in noun phrases, not directly relevant to SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Discusses the order of story introductions, not directly relevant to SOV order.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Uru,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the examples and statements about the typical sentence structure in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (38): ""kunua pek-u-cay"" translates to ""I want a woman (= wife)."" Here, ""kunua"" (woman) is the object, and ""I"" is the subject, with the verb ""want"" at the end. This indicates an SOV order.
   - Statement: ""the principal word order is SOV.""

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Statement: ""word order does not differ from the most common types found in declarative clauses, i.e. SOV, SV, or OV."" This suggests that SOV is one of the common orders.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Statement: ""Both the matrix as well as the adverbial clause show an unmarked declarative word order in principle, i.e. SOV (although rather exceptionally), SV, or OV."" This again suggests SOV as a common order.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (41): ""awariskiya pikitka lul-ay"" translates to ""Eat the bread, the two of you!"" Here, ""bread"" is the object, and ""the two of you"" is the subject, with the verb ""eat"" at the end. This indicates an SOV order.
   - Statement: ""the word orders of SOV and OSV are the most common ones.""

5. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (66): ""wir-l-ipek-s-n-u-cay"" translates to ""I demanded it."" Here, ""I"" is the subject, ""it"" is the object, and ""demanded"" is the verb, indicating an SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Example (36): ""ana-cul[u] mitki-ca-aca-cay6 wir-ki"" translates to ""Into nothing I could interfere."" Here, ""I"" is the subject, ""nothing"" is the object, and ""interfere"" is the verb, indicating an SOV order.
   - Statement: ""Uchumataqu has a very strong tendency to place the verb at the end of a clause.""

7. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example (30): ""ni-ki cins(i) pa-cay"" translates to ""(S)he makes a mat."" Here, ""(S)he"" is the subject, ""mat"" is the object, and ""makes"" is the verb, indicating an SOV order.
   - Statement: ""its basic word order is SOV.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Uru is **SOV**. The examples and explicit statements consistently indicate that the subject-object-verb order is the most common and unmarked structure in declarative sentences. 

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kamsá, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""This holds true for Kamsá: it has very free word order. The language seems to be SOV but because the word order is so free, and perhaps because of the influence of Spanish, it is not clear yet what should be considered its basic word order, if anything.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremely flexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - SVO: ""ch bobonts tojashwa shlobts̈"" (The young man hunted birds)
     - SOV: ""ch bobonts shlobts̈ tojashwa"" (The young man hunted birds)
     - SVO: ""mënte kachës ch bobonts tonjwaliya librësha"" (This morning the young man read a book)
     - SOV: ""Carmen kanÿe mashakbe tonjobuayán"" (Carmen chose a lulo fruit)

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - ""Aa bako shajwanam kwatëkjabo?"" (Uncle, did you come for fruits?)
     - ""Kebuntjá jenokwedam kachoy?"" (Would you go with me to eat together there?)

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - No relevant information on word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - ""Tsbananok ats̈na tswatma nÿets bnëte ts̈aba jtsamanam"" (I’m used to living in the tall part to sleep well all day)
     - ""nÿets bnëte i nÿets ibet"" (all day and all night)

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen ats̈be batabiam"" (I cooked mote for my aunt)
     - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen ats̈be kes̈byam"" (I cooked mote for my dog)

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - ""Ch tobias̈ tonjwabwa wameshnen bëngbiam"" (The girl cooked mote for us)
     - ""Carmen intsabwana wameshnen ats̈be wampnan taitabiok"" (Carmen is cooking mote at my father-in-law’s place)

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Examples of different word orders:
     - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen ats̈be batabiam"" (I cooked mote for my aunt)
     - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen ats̈be kes̈byam"" (I cooked mote for my dog)

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Examples of different word orders:
      - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen Carmen-abtak"" (I cooked mote with Carmen)
      - ""Ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen ak-abtak"" (I cooked mote with you)

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Kamsá exhibits a very flexible word order. However, there is a noted preference for the SOV order, which is mentioned explicitly in the grammar and supported by several examples. Despite the influence of Spanish potentially shifting the word order towards SVO, the dominant order in the language appears to be SOV.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov

Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the dominant word order in Cuiba with absolute certainty. However, some insights can be drawn from the data:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the order of tagmemes is free, with some exceptions. This suggests a flexible word order but does not specify a dominant order.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides a narrative context but does not give clear examples of subject, object, and verb order.
3. **Paragraph 4** lists verb group clitics and their positions but does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.
4. **Paragraph 5** shows examples of clitic attachment and word formation but does not clarify the order of subject, object, and verb.
5. **Paragraph 9** gives an example of a sentence structure involving a subject and verb but lacks clarity on the object placement.
6. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of verb groups and noun compounds but does not specify the order of subject, object, and verb.
7. **Paragraph 15** shows examples of sentences with verbs and objects but does not provide a clear pattern for subject placement.
8. **Paragraph 19** provides narrative examples but does not clearly indicate the order of subject, object, and verb.
9. **Paragraph 33** gives background information on the language and its speakers but does not address word order.
10. **Paragraph 50** provides a narrative example but does not clearly indicate the order of subject, object, and verb.

Given the information, the data suggests a flexible word order with no clear dominant pattern emerging from the examples provided. The grammar does not explicitly mention a dominant word order, and the examples given do not consistently follow a single pattern.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar indicates flexibility in the order of tagmemes.
- Examples provided do not consistently follow a single word order pattern.
- No explicit mention of a dominant word order in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",sov,no dominant order
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the frequency and acceptability of different constituent orders (S, O, V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph discusses the frequency distribution of constituent order types and mentions that OSV cannot be considered a syntactically structured order type. It suggests that constituent order patterns are motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors. The text also provides a table summarizing clausal constituent orders, including OSV, SOV, SV, and others.
   - The frequency count based on texts shows that clauses with both NP-subject and NP-object co-occurring are only 8.6% of all clauses. This indicates that such clauses are relatively rare.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of different constituent orders: SOV, OSV, SVO, OVS, VOS, and VSO. It notes that VSO is not acceptable, and VOS and VSO are not attested in text material. It also mentions that except for VSO, all clausal constituent order patterns are acceptable in the language.
   - The examples show that SOV, OSV, SVO, and OVS are possible, but VSO is not.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph discusses the use of interrogative words and provides examples of sentences with different constituent orders. It does not directly address the dominant word order but shows flexibility in constituent order.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph is part of the introduction to the grammar and does not provide specific information about constituent order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph discusses clausal constituent order variation and mentions that the distribution of clausal constituents in a sentence cannot be predicted on grammatical grounds alone. It emphasizes the role of discourse-pragmatic factors.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph provides a table showing the frequency of pre-verbal and post-verbal subjects and objects. It shows a strong tendency for subjects to occur pre-verbally (91%) and for objects to occur post-verbally (60%).

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph discusses the core grammatical relations and mentions that the distribution of clausal constituents cannot be used as a defining criterion for subject- and objecthood due to the variation in constituent order.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - This paragraph summarizes the evidence for subject-object distinctions and mentions that the distribution of clausal constituents varies and cannot be predicted purely on grammatical grounds.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - This paragraph discusses the constituent order in potentially ambiguous sentences and provides examples where both SOV and OSV are possible. It notes that some speakers choose OSV as the default order when ambiguity cannot be resolved by semantics and pragmatics.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - This paragraph discusses the lack of a clear-cut relationship between discourse-pragmatic factors and constituent order, suggesting that no single constituent order type can be convincingly associated with a single unmarked/neutral discourse-pragmatic factor.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - This paragraph discusses the structure of verb and object NPs and mentions that there is no convincing positive evidence to argue that a verb plus the object NP form a phrasal unit similar to a VP in English.

12. **Paragraph 12**:
    - This paragraph discusses the resolution of constituent order in potentially ambiguous sentences and provides examples of SOV and OSV orders.

13. **Paragraph 13**:
    - This paragraph discusses the typological features of Apurinã and mentions that the language is predominantly OV in terms of its word order correlations, although the most frequent order in text is VO.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - This paragraph discusses the structure of simplex sentences and provides examples of different constituent orders, including SOV and OSV.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - This paragraph discusses the evidence for subject-object distinctions and mentions that the distribution of clausal constituents varies and cannot be predicted purely on grammatical grounds.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Apurinã exhibits a high degree of flexibility in constituent order, with no single order being dominant. The language shows a tendency for subjects to occur pre-verbally and objects to occur post-verbally, but this is not consistent enough to establish a dominant order. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is:

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",svo,no dominant order
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

The paragraphs provided offer a comprehensive view of the word order in Kadiwéu. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 5** both mention that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely and includes orders such as VSO, SVO, OVS, VOS, SOV, and OSV. This indicates a high degree of flexibility in word order.
2. **Paragraph 5** specifically notes that while Griffiths reported a predominant SVO order, this was likely influenced by elicitation techniques, and the actual usage in Kadiwéu is much freer.
3. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 14** highlight that Kadiwéu is a nonconfigurational language, which typically means that it has a free word order.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 8** provide additional context that certain orders like OSV and OVS are avoided in isolated sentences to prevent ambiguity, but they are used when the context clarifies the roles of the subject and object.
5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 22** further support the idea of free constituent order by noting that nominal phrases are usually absent and that the presence or absence of nominal phrases is not a conclusive criterion for distinguishing clause types.

Given this information, it is clear that Kadiwéu does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of flexibility in the arrangement of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Karajá by examining the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: 
   - ""However, when both subject and object are nouns, they can only be distinguished by the word order, canonically SOV.""
   - This explicitly states that the canonical word order in Karajá is SOV when both the subject and the object are nouns.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the verb...""
   - This reinforces the SOV word order, indicating that the object typically forms a prosodic unit with the verb, which is characteristic of SOV languages.

3. **Paragraph 17**:
   - ""Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language.""
   - This directly states that Karajá follows an SOV word order.

4. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Examples provided follow the SOV structure:
     - ""dIkar´) waha ka-r-I-rakOèk´re"" translates to ""I will wait for my father.""
     - ""waha ∅-r-I-wa-rakOèk´re"" translates to ""My father will wait for me.""
   - Both examples show the subject preceding the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Karajá is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), as explicitly stated in multiple paragraphs and supported by example sentences.",sov,sov
