Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, we can analyze the dominant word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph introduces the structure of simple clauses in Supyire, mentioning that verbal clauses can have various constituents, including direct objects, which are placed between the auxiliary and the verb. This suggests an S-Aux-O-V structure.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples of verbal clauses, showing that the direct object appears between the auxiliary and the verb:
   - Example (5): ""Unmha suroshwoho"" (she HAB mush cook) translates to ""She cooks mush,"" indicating an S-Aux-O-V order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that the constituent order in simple clauses is subject-predicate, with examples illustrating the order subject—predicate. This supports the S-Aux-O-V structure.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that the direct object precedes the verb but all indirect objects follow it. This aligns with the S-Aux-O-V structure.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides an example where the verb follows the subject and auxiliary, with the direct object placed before the verb:
   - Example (99): ""U u-yd niq-keen-iji na zäntüqb"" (he he-REFL ADJ-change-DEF on hyena) translates to ""While he was changing himself into a hyena,"" indicating an S-Aux-O-V structure.

6. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses complex questions and serial verb constructions, showing that the direct object can be questioned and placed in focus position, but it does not contradict the S-Aux-O-V structure.

7. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses grammaticalized verbs in serial constructions, indicating that the direct object can appear between the auxiliary and the verb, supporting the S-Aux-O-V structure.

8. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph mentions that the examples used in the grammar reflect the natural word order of Supyire, which aligns with the previously observed S-Aux-O-V structure.

9. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses cleft constructions and the use of a copular element in the negative, but it does not contradict the S-Aux-O-V structure.

10. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides examples of constituent questions, showing that the direct object can be placed in focus position, but it does not contradict the S-Aux-O-V structure.

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Jamsay by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text explicitly states: ""The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.""
   - Examples provided in the text, such as:
     - ""The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.""

   - Examples:
     - ""The hyena ate the hare."" (SOV)
     - ""The elephant came out and encountered them, in the field."" (SVO, but the verb ""encountered"" follows the object ""them"")

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Discusses verb types and valency but does not directly address the word order of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Discusses various constructions but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

   - States that ""Most if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.""
   - This supports the SOV structure.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses the linear order within noun phrases but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Discusses various noun phrase structures but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Jamsay is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), as explicitly stated and exemplified in the provided paragraphs.",sov,sov
Ma'di,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** provides crucial information about the word order in different dialects of Ma'di. It states that the 'Burulo dialect is SVO, while the Lokai dialect is partly SVO and partly SOV. This indicates that there is some variability in word order within the language, but SVO is clearly a dominant pattern, at least in the 'Burulo dialect.

2. **Paragraph 2** shows examples of sentences where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb, which is consistent with SVO order. For example, ""maeßlparaIS fish N-eat AFF"" translates to ""I will certainly eat fish,"" where the subject ""I"" precedes the verb ""eat,"" and the object ""fish"" follows the verb.

3. **Paragraph 13** provides another example of SVO order: ""ká gbándá pä 3S cassava N-eat,"" which translates to ""He is eating cassava."" Here, the subject ""He"" precedes the verb ""eat,"" and the object ""cassava"" follows the verb.

4. **Paragraph 14** mentions that in the 'Burulo dialect, the object never precedes the inflected verb, reinforcing the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 17** also supports the SVO order by mentioning that the Lokai dialect can have object-verb order, but this is not the case in the 'Burulo dialect, which is SVO.

6. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 10** provide examples where the object can be left-dislocated or placed before the verb for emphasis or focus, but these are marked constructions and not indicative of the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Ma'di, particularly in the 'Burulo dialect, is SVO.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Bangime,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the default or most commonly expressed word orders across different tense, aspect, and mood (TAM) categories.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 2**: It states that the attested word orders in Bangime are SVO, SOV, and OSV for untopicalized sentences. Specifically, the incompletive aspects are usually SVO, the completive aspects SOV, and the future can be expressed with OSV word order.
   - **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that the incompletive categories are usually in SOV order, while the completed categories are SVO. The future tense may be either SOV or OSV.
   - **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of SVO word order in the completive aspect and mentions that the perfective aspect also uses SVO word order.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the irrealis mood, which also uses SVO word order.
   - **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that the default word order for an incompletive clause with an object is SOV.
   - **Paragraph 9**: States that the completive and incompletive aspects are complementary in word order, SVO and SOV, respectively.
   - **Paragraph 10**: Provides examples of SVO and SOV word orders in different aspects.
   - **Paragraph 11**: Mentions that the perfective aspect is normally formed with SVO word order.
   - **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the passive construction, which uses OSV word order.
   - **Paragraph 13**: States that in an incompletive clause with an object, the default word order is subject-object-verb (SOV).

From the above information, it is clear that Bangime exhibits variability in word order depending on the TAM category. However, the most frequently mentioned and default word orders are SVO for completive and perfective aspects and SOV for incompletive aspects. Given the prominence of SVO in multiple aspects and moods, it can be inferred that SVO is the dominant word order.

2. **Conclusion:** SVO",no dominant order,svo
Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and descriptions of constituent orders in transitive and intransitive clauses.

#### Paragraph 1:
- **Transitive constituent order**: The paragraph mentions that transitive constituent order in Gumuz varies between AVP (Agent-Verb-Patient) and APV (Agent-Patient-Verb). Other orders like PVA (Patient-Verb-Agent), VAP (Verb-Agent-Patient), and VPA (Verb-Patient-Agent) are also possible depending on the discourse context.
- **Intransitive constituent order**: It varies between SV (Subject-Verb) and VS (Verb-Subject).
- **Examples**:
  - (10.71) NoG: A V P - ""The child rolled the tire.""
  - (10.72) SoG: A V P - ""The donkey ate the grass.""
  - (10.73) NoG: A P V - ""He found salt.""
  - (10.74) SoG: A P V - ""The woman raised her child.""
  - (10.75) NoG: P V A - ""The fire consumed the house.""
  - (10.76) SoG: P V A - ""The wind broke the tree.""
  - (10.77) NoG: V A P - ""And he took my child.""

From these examples, we can see that the language exhibits a variety of word orders, but AVP (SVO) and APV (SOV) are more frequently mentioned.

#### Paragraph 9:
- **Relativizing on A Arguments**: The paragraph mentions that the typical word order for relativizing on A arguments is AVO (Agent-Verb-Object), which mirrors the more typical word order of Gumuz main clauses.

#### Paragraph 11:
- **Example**:
  - (12.50) a. AVO - ""The person hit the woman.""
  - b. AVO - ""The person that hit the woman is here.""

This supports the observation that AVO (SVO) is a common word order in Gumuz.

#### Paragraph 14:
- **Example**:
  - (12.51) AVO - ""The one who hit the chair is Bamita.""

Again, this supports the AVO (SVO) word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Gumuz appears to be **SVO**. This is supported by multiple examples and descriptions indicating that the typical word order in main clauses and relative clauses is AVO (SVO).

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Koyra Chiini can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states: ""The basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object),"" and provides examples that follow this pattern:
   - (6) [bar di] ο guna [woy di] doodi [man Dei] Impf see [woman DefJ there 'The man sees the woman there.'
   - (7) a guna ni doodi 3Sg see 2Sg there 'He (She) saw you(Sg) there.'
   - (8) ay na guna [[huu di] kuna] [boro foo] ISgS Neg see [[house DefJ Loc] [person one] 'I didn't see anyone in the house.'

2. **Paragraph 4** reinforces this by stating: ""Each of (6-8) begins with a subject NP... The verb stem, here guna 'see', has no inflectional affixes for either pronominal agreement or MAN categories. The direct object NP follows the verb (though not always immediately)...""

3. **Paragraph 5** further supports this by stating: ""The distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order. Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct objects and PPs.""

4. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of subject and object personal pronouns, showing the syntactic order as subject + verb + object:
   - (59) a. ay kar gi 'I hit them.'
   - b. a kar ey 'She hit me.'
   - c. i kar ga 'They hit him.'

5. **Paragraph 19** mentions: ""KCh and DjCh show S-MAN-V-X constituent order (subject, mood-aspect-negation, verb, other elements including direct object)... In Greenbergian terms, Western Songhay is SVO...""

These paragraphs consistently indicate that the basic word order in Koyra Chiini is SVO.

**Reasoning:**
The paragraphs provide multiple explicit statements and examples that the basic constituent order in Koyra Chiini is SVO. This is supported by the structure of sentences given in the examples, where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Seme,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in the language Seme can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses OV word order in Siamou and mentions that SVO is not permitted.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Explicitly states that the basic word order of Siamou clauses is S (Particle) OV.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that head-final order is prevalent in Siamou and aligns with SOV characteristics.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses SOV characteristics in Siamou and mentions that it has exclusive SOV word order.
5. **Paragraph 8**: States that Siamou sentences always have surface SOV word order.
6. **Paragraph 9**: Reiterates that Siamou has an S (Part) OV word order all the time.
7. **Paragraph 14**: Confirms that Siamou consistently has SOV word order.
8. **Paragraph 18**: Summarizes that Siamou has SOV word order among other SOV characteristics.

The consistent mention of SOV word order across multiple paragraphs, along with the explicit statements that Siamou has exclusive SOV word order and does not alternate between SVO and SOV, strongly indicates that the dominant word order in Siamou is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tima,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Tima can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the word order concerning a type of passive is SVO. This indicates that in at least some constructions, Tima follows an SVO order.
2. **Paragraph 6** explicitly states that the active word order of the sentence in Tima is SVO.
3. **Paragraph 7** provides examples of sentences with SVO order, such as ""uŋ-k-umun-dʌy-ana"" ('I found/saw cows'), which follows the SVO structure.
4. **Paragraph 5** shows examples where the subject precedes the object, such as ""a-hɔ-ø"" ('he hit him/her'), which aligns with an SVO structure when considering the full sentence context.

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Katcha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the dominant word order in Katcha by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly mentions that Katcha's basic word order is either SVO or VSO. This is a direct statement about the language's syntax, providing clear evidence of the possible dominant word orders.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses passive constructions, which are less relevant for determining the basic word order of active declarative sentences. However, it does not contradict the information provided in Paragraph 1.

3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 4** focus on case markers and subject relatives, respectively. These paragraphs do not provide direct information about the basic word order but do discuss syntactic structures that are consistent with both SVO and VSO orders.

4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss locative adverbs and pronouns, respectively. These paragraphs provide additional syntactic details but do not directly address the basic word order.

5. **Paragraph 7** through **Paragraph 20** provide various syntactic and morphological analyses, including discussions on verb extensions, applicatives, and nominal modifiers. These paragraphs offer insights into the complexity of Katcha syntax but do not contradict the basic word order options provided in Paragraph 1.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 1 and the lack of contradictory evidence in the other paragraphs, we can conclude that Katcha has a dominant word order that includes both SVO and VSO.

### Conclusion:
SVO or VSO",no dominant order,svo
Ijo (Kolokuma),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ijo (Kolokuma), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** provides examples of verb phrases and their complements, showing structures like ""NP+V"" (e.g., ""t o b q dii"" - ""child look"" meaning ""look at a child"") and ""NP+Vmove+-mQ"" (e.g., ""t o b y wenj-mQ"" - ""child walk D"" meaning ""walk towards a child""). These examples suggest a Subject-Verb (SV) structure, but they do not provide clear evidence of the position of the object.

2. **Paragraph 2** contains examples of sentences with transitive verbs and their objects, such as ""y6 gba-nj,l y-pjrj"" (thing say him give - ""say something to him"") and ""dbma tun-ni, a-pjri"" (song sing her give - ""sing a song for her""). These examples show a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure.

3. **Paragraph 3** includes sentences with verbs of motion, such as ""eri, b6-mi"" (he come Spa - ""he came"") and ""eri, atni dbo-mi"" (he town1 go-through Spa - ""he went through the town""). These examples do not clearly indicate the position of the object in relation to the verb and subject.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses transformations and sentence structures but does not provide explicit examples of basic declarative sentences with clear subject, object, and verb positions.

5. **Paragraph 5** includes examples like ""kOk? bo-dqy"" (actually come IPa - ""has actually come"") and ""ogb66g b6"" (is Oghoogho - ""is Oghoogho""), which do not involve objects and thus do not help in determining the SOV/SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 6** provides examples like ""td-bi, ebi-nimi"" (reason T he-good StPr - ""the reason is good"") and ""i r i s f+y yoy-yemi"" (you market paddle Hab - ""you are trading""), which do not include objects.

7. **Paragraph 7** discusses pronouns and their forms but does not provide relevant examples for determining word order.

8. **Paragraph 8** includes examples like ""buru nana-bQ"" (yam own one - ""owner (m.) of yams"") and ""inei (=in& ye, M.23)"" (your thing - ""this build IF house T""), which are not relevant for determining the basic word order.

9. **Paragraph 9** lists various verb forms but does not provide sentence examples.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses phrase-structure rules but does not provide clear examples of subject, object, and verb positions.

11. **Paragraph 11** includes examples like ""tybara-k["" (who with - ""who with?"") and ""nda-5 Ikora]"" (how-many year - ""how many years?""), which are not relevant for determining the basic word order.

12. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of noun phrase transformations but does not include clear subject, object, and verb positions.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses numeral adjustments but does not provide relevant examples for determining word order.

14. **Paragraph 14** includes examples like ""eri-ki, b6-d?v"" (he em come IPa - ""it is he who has come"") and ""omtnj, ken[ 6b6ri toboy erj-mj"" (they a goat child see Spa - ""it was a young goat they saw""), which suggest an SOV structure.

15. **Paragraph 15** discusses pronoun forms but does not provide relevant examples for determining word order.

16. **Paragraph 16** includes examples like ""fjaj tyo-g/ indi, a m+ f+-d$y"" (food cook SF fish she it buy IPa - ""fish to cook is what she's bought""), which suggests an SOV structure.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses transformations but does not provide relevant examples for determining word order.

18. **Paragraph 18** includes examples like ""eri, weni-da, ami syp-mi"" (he walk and town enter Spa - ""he walked and then entered a town""), which do not involve objects.

19. **Paragraph 19** discusses the introduction of ""akjz 'USE'"" but does not provide relevant examples for determining word order.

20. **Paragraph 20** includes examples like ""eri, wiri wen[-mi"" (he house walk Spa - ""he walked the house""), which are not relevant for determining the basic word order.

**Reasoning:**
The examples provided in Paragraphs 2, 14, and 16 consistently show a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure. This is evident in sentences like ""y6 gba-nj,l y-pjrj"" (thing say him give - ""say something to him""), ""dbma tun-ni, a-pjri"" (song sing her give - ""sing a song for her""), and ""omtnj, ken[ 6b6ri toboy erj-mj"" (they a goat child see Spa - ""it was a young goat they saw"").

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, the dominant word order in Emai can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides a clear example of a declarative sentence with a transitive verb, showing the order of subject, verb, and object:
   - Sentence: ""ólí ómòhè é ólí émàè."" (the man PRP.eat the food)
   - Translation: ""The man has eaten the food.""
   - Word order: Subject (ólí ómòhè) - Verb (é) - Object (ólí émàè)

2. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph also supports the SVO order with another example:
   - Sentence: ""ólí ómòhè dá' ényó vbí áfúzé' òdè."" (the man PAP.drink wine LOC Afuze yesterday)
   - Translation: ""The man drank wine in Afuze yesterday.""
   - Word order: Subject (ólí ómòhè) - Verb (dá') - Object (ényó)

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph further confirms the SVO order in a different context:
   - Sentence: ""òjè één-í khí ólí ómòhè khí ó é' ólí émà."" (Oje PRP.know-F IND the man IND he PAP.eat the yam)
   - Translation: ""Oje knew that as for the man, he ate the yam.""
   - Word order: Subject (ó) - Verb (é') - Object (ólí émà)

4. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides additional examples of the SVO order in various contexts:
   - Sentence: ""ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè."" (he PAP.kill the rat ID be the man)
   - Translation: ""He killed the rat, that is the man.""
   - Word order: Subject (ó) - Verb (gbé') - Object (ólí ófè)

These examples consistently show the subject preceding the verb, which in turn precedes the object, indicating that the dominant word order in Emai is SVO.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses. It also provides examples of both intransitive and transitive sentences that follow the VSO order:
   - (30) Epa ŋok. (sleep-REAL dog-NOM) ""The dog is asleep."" (VS)
   - (31) Atsʼa ŋoka oka. (gnaw-REAL dog-NOM bone-ACC) ""The dog gnaws a bone."" (VAO)

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses subordinate clauses, noting that they have an SVO constituent order, which is different from the main clause order. However, it reinforces that the main clause order is VSO.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph further confirms that complement clauses, though subordinate, retain the VSO order of non-embedded main clauses.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that auxiliary verb constructions also follow the Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O order, which aligns with the SVO order found in subordinate clauses.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses temporal subordinate clauses and their structure, which again follows the SVO order, but it does not contradict the VSO order of main clauses.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of motion verbs and object case marking but does not provide new information about the dominant word order in main clauses.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the case system and confirms that subjects of indicative clauses always bear the nominative case and follow the VSO order in main clauses.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides an overview of verbs and their inflectional properties but does not contradict the VSO order in main clauses.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses noun compounding and does not provide new information about the dominant word order in main clauses.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of sequential impersonal passive forms and confirms that sequential clauses maintain the VSO order.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides a typological overview and confirms that the basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses cleft constructions and does not contradict the VSO order in main clauses.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses left-dislocation and confirms that the main clause order is VSO.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the accusative case and confirms that the direct object of a transitive clause with a third-person subject takes the accusative case, aligning with the VSO order.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the nominative case and confirms that subjects of indicative clauses always bear the nominative case and follow the VSO order in main clauses.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses argument-drop properties and confirms that the basic constituent order is VSO.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the solicitive intonation pattern and does not contradict the VSO order in main clauses.

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Ngiti:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that the Perfective Present has SVO word order. It also mentions that in the Present Continuous, the order is SAuxOV (NOM), where the object precedes the nominalized verb stem, and an auxiliary follows the subject.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the cliticization of subject and object pronouns to the verb stem. It mentions that object pronouns may be cliticized to the verb stem when they follow an auxiliary verb and precede the main verb (in SAuxOV constructions). This suggests that the object can precede the verb in certain constructions, but it does not contradict the SVO order mentioned for the Perfective Present.

3. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the use of subject and object clitics and their placement relative to the verb. It mentions that object clitics are cliticized immediately to the verb stem whenever they precede the main verb in a SAuxOV configuration. This again indicates that the object can precede the verb in certain constructions but does not provide a dominant word order for declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects.

4. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with the verb ""to be"" and shows that the subject precedes the verb in these constructions, consistent with SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with verbs of speaking and shows that the subject precedes the verb, consistent with SVO order.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the dominant word order in Ngiti is SVO, as explicitly mentioned in Paragraph 2 and supported by examples in other paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that when the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words, the word order is predominantly SOV. It also mentions that OSV order is possible but only when the subject is in focus, indicating that SOV is the neutral or unmarked word order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the information by stating that the basic word order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of constituent order in benefactive constructions as long as the verb is final, which is consistent with an SOV structure where the verb typically appears at the end.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the structure of relative clauses and other adnominal constructions, which are not directly relevant to the basic SOV order but do not contradict it.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that another constituent can intervene between the two NPs, but it does not contradict the basic SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with the verb at the end, consistent with SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the order of noun suffixes, which is not directly relevant to the basic SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions the flexibility of adverbial positions but does not contradict the basic SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with the verb at the end, consistent with SOV order.

Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can analyze the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Mursi utilizes a canonical constituent order AVO/SV and a non-canonical OVA/VS order. This suggests that the language has a flexible word order but indicates a preference for AVO (which can be interpreted as SVO) in canonical contexts.

2. **Paragraph 5**: It explicitly states that ""AVO/SV is by far the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses uttered in isolation."" This reinforces the idea that the dominant word order in Mursi is AVO (SVO).

3. **Paragraph 6**: Provides examples of AVO (SVO) order in monotransitive clauses, further supporting the prevalence of this word order.

4. **Paragraph 15**: It mentions that Mursi is a nominative-accusative language with a canonical constituent order AVO (SVO) for transitive clauses and SV for intransitive clauses.

5. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the placement of interrogative words and confirms that Mursi follows an AVO (SVO) order in canonical contexts.

6. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions that Mursi verbs obligatorily inflect for bound pronominal S/A and O arguments, and provides examples that align with the AVO (SVO) order.

From these points, it is clear that the dominant word order in Mursi is AVO (SVO) in canonical contexts, even though the language allows for flexibility in certain pragmatic or syntactic conditions.

### Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Majang can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the VSO order and mentions that SVO clauses were occasionally elicited but not preferred. It also highlights the VAP (Verb-Agent-Patient) order, which is a strong indication of the psychological standing of this structure in Majang speakers' mental grammar.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that in a Majang clause where the constituents A (Agent), verb, and P (Patient) are overtly expressed, they frequently appear in the order Verb – Subject – Object (VSO). It also provides examples showing this order and mentions that VAP is invariably the order of constituents when eliciting transitive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reinforces the VAP order by providing examples and discussing its infrequency in natural discourse but its prevalence in elicited sentences.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph confirms that the basic clause configuration in Majang is VAP, and the verb is directly followed by an absolutive noun phrase, which aligns with the VSO order.

5. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph reiterates that the basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP (Verb-Agent-Patient), which corresponds to the VSO order.

6. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the placement of new-information focus at the end of the clause, which supports the VSO structure where the subject (Agent) follows the verb and precedes the object (Patient).

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Majang is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). This order is consistently mentioned and exemplified as the basic and preferred structure in both elicited and natural clauses.

### Conclusion:
VSO",vso,vso
Birri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Birri, we can analyze the word order by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is finite.

1. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example: ""ene-re a6d onyo"" (they are porridge eating).
   - Structure: Subject (ene-re) + Object (a6d) + Verb (onyo).
   - This suggests an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example: ""To steal idi dv"" (to steal thing).
   - Structure: Object (idi) + Verb (dv).
   - This suggests an OV order, but without a clear subject, it is incomplete for determining the dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""He brought a big tree ana re kpi ukama"" (he came with a tree big).
   - Structure: Subject (ana) + Verb (re) + Object (kpi ukama).
   - This suggests an SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Example: ""He hit the lion’s head with a (piece of) wood eme anvuruvi clru re kpi"" (he hit the lion’s head with wood).
   - Structure: Subject (eme) + Object (anvuruvi clru) + Verb (re kpi).
   - This suggests an SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example: ""Did the boys eat? rende mugu anyone ede?"" (boys many ate thing?).
   - Structure: Subject (rende mugu) + Object (anyone) + Verb (ede).
   - This suggests an SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example: ""They caught us with-no-reason anvune amanyi kerekpa"" (they caught us without reason).
   - Structure: Subject (anvune) + Object (amanyi) + Verb (kerekpa).
   - This suggests an SOV order.

From the above examples, it is evident that the SOV order appears consistently in sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Although there are instances of SVO, the predominant pattern observed is SOV.

**Reasoning**:
- The majority of the examples provided show a clear SOV structure.
- Even in cases where the verb appears before the object, the subject typically precedes both, reinforcing the SOV pattern.

**Conclusion**:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Tamashek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can analyze the word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences and the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of sentences with verbs and objects:
   - Example: ""îfùk 3PSCP read íkpá book"" translates to ""He read the book.""
   - Here, the structure is Subject (îfùk) - Verb (read) - Object (book), indicating an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the structure of the verb phrase and mentions that the verb is the head of the VP, which includes the direct object. This implies that the verb precedes the object within the verb phrase, supporting an SVO structure.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides a schematic representation of sentence structure:
   - The structure shows NP (subject) followed by VP, where the verb dominates the direct object, again indicating an SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 12** discusses the argument structure and mentions that transitive verbs take both a subject NP and a direct object NP. This implies a typical SVO structure where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

5. **Paragraph 18** provides examples of complex verbs and their complements, showing that the verb and its complement (object) follow the subject, consistent with an SVO order.

From these observations, it is clear that the dominant word order in Igbo is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

     - **tí4gérêm %á%4zí túrà** (AUG-woman:PL sow:PFV-PL millet) translates to ""the women sowed millet.""
       - S (subject) = ""tí4gérêm"" (the women)
       - V (verb) = ""%á%4zí"" (sowed)
       - O (object) = ""túrà"" (millet)
     - **mìí yáh pìzá** (1SG:IRR take:FUT horse) translates to ""I will take the horse.""
       - S = ""mìí"" (I)
       - V = ""yáh"" (will take)
       - O = ""pìzá"" (horse)

2. **Additional Support from Paragraphs**:
   - **Paragraph 1** mentions that constituent order is covered in section 10.1.1, which aligns with the detailed explanation in Paragraph 2.
   - **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 4** provide examples of verb forms and their usage but do not directly address the basic word order.
   - **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss verb forms and auxiliary constructions, which further support the SVO structure by showing consistent subject-verb-object ordering in examples.
   - **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss verb classes and adverbial clauses, respectively, but do not contradict the SVO order.
   - **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** provide additional examples of verb usage and ideophonic adverbs, maintaining the SVO structure.
   - **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** discuss verb forms and subjunctive constructions, again supporting the SVO order.
   - **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** provide further examples of verb forms and their usage, consistent with the SVO structure.

Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can infer the dominant word order in Koromfe by examining the positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""The subject NP is positioned before the verb.""
   - ""There is no difference between the subject of a transitive verb and that of an intransitive verb.""

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""The direct object NP is positioned after the verb.""

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Koromfe sentences require a subject, but are quite free in allowing (or allowing the omission of) all other verb arguments.""

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - ""The indirect object NP is positioned after the verb.""

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - ""In a non-topicalized, non-emphatic sentence, the order of constituents is NP1 -copula-NP2, whereby NP1 is usually the subject of the copula and NP2 its complement.""

6. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""Word order is used to distinguish the NP arguments of the verb; in a simple non-emphasized sentence the subject NP precedes the verb (sole exception: 2nd person plural imperatives) and the object NPs (direct and indirect) follow the verb.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the typical order of constituents in Koromfe declarative sentences is:

- Subject (S) precedes the verb (V).
- Object (O) follows the verb (V).

This indicates that the dominant word order in Koromfe is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object).

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Nobiin,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nobiin, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The examples provided show a verb-final structure, such as ""the woman who served the boy said to him"" and ""the tree which you cursed has withered."" The verb appears at the end of the clause, suggesting an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 4**: The text mentions that ""Nobiin is basically a verb-final language,"" which supports the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 12**: The examples of main clauses show verbs at the end of the sentences, such as ""the teacher, coming, calls you"" and ""my daughter Miskine is coming."" This again suggests an SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 13**: The examples of relative clauses show the participle or subjunctive at the end of the clause, such as ""the man who says the word"" and ""the word, which the man said."" This supports the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 19**: The examples provided show verbs at the end of the sentences, such as ""he revealed to us a mystery"" and ""making one two, he got rid of it for us without denial."" This further supports the SOV order.

The consistent placement of the verb at the end of the clause across various examples and contexts strongly indicates that the dominant word order in Nobiin is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nyimang can be determined through the analysis of sentence structures where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** provides several examples of sentences:
   - ""gil doso ka tam"" (the dog is eating food)
   - ""kwedile ka fidsij"" (the salt is finished)

   All these sentences follow the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions the placement of particles in relation to the verb and subject, but it does not provide clear examples of full sentences with both subject and object nouns.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of sentences with verbs and objects:
   - ""a bwir kagoIJ a ma~d~"" (I know the child)
   - ""i teIJ kagoIJ wedi?"" (Do you have a field?)
   - ""ei, a teIJ kagoIJ wedi"" (Yes, I have a field)
   - ""griIJ ma nedi a?"" (Do you see the donkey?)
   - ""griIJ f'oru nedi"" (Yes, I see the donkey)
   - ""i gilo a wen?"" (Do you see the dog?)
   - ""ei, a gilo a wen"" (Yes, I see the dog)

   These examples also follow the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of sentences with intransitive verbs, which do not help in determining the order of subject and object.

Based on the analysis of the provided sentences, it is clear that the dominant word order in Nyimang is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Lamé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the relative positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""A direct object noun immediately follows the verb.""
   - ""In the perfective/subjunctive clause the direct object pronoun follows the verb (SVO).""
   - ""In the non-perfective clause the direct object pronoun follows the tense/aspect marker and precedes the verb (S Tense/Aspect O V).""

   This indicates that in perfective/subjunctive clauses, the structure is SVO. In non-perfective clauses, the structure can be S (Tense/Aspect) O V, but this is specifically for pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""SVO"" is mentioned multiple times in the context of perfective/subjunctive clauses.
   - ""S (T/A) O V"" and ""S (T/A) V O"" are mentioned for non-perfective clauses.

   This reinforces the idea that SVO is a common structure, especially in perfective/subjunctive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""In the perfective clause, the indirect object can be marked by position alone, provided it immediately follows the verb and is immediately followed by a nominal direct object.""
   - ""In the non-perfective clause with a pronominal direct object and no indirect object (S O V).""

   This again suggests that SVO is a common structure, particularly in perfective clauses.

4. **Paragraph 15**:
   - ""The subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and verb.""
   - ""In a perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun follows the verb.""
   - ""In a non-perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun precedes the verb.""

   This paragraph confirms that in perfective clauses, the structure is SVO, while in non-perfective clauses, the structure can be SOV for pronominal objects.

5. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""In a perfective clause with only a subject and a nominal direct object, the object noun immediately follows the verb.""
   - ""In a non-perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun precedes the verb.""

   This further supports the SVO structure in perfective clauses and SOV structure in non-perfective clauses for pronominal objects.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the paragraphs, the dominant word order in Lamé is **SVO**. This structure is consistently mentioned in the context of perfective/subjunctive clauses, which appear to be the primary focus in the provided grammar descriptions. Non-perfective clauses show some variation, particularly with pronominal objects, but the dominant order remains SVO.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Bininj Gun-Wok,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, the word order in Bininj Gun-Wok appears to be quite flexible, with no single dominant order. The language allows for various constituent orders, and the choice of order can be influenced by discourse factors and the need to convey specific pragmatic information.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that all orderings are grammatically possible and that there is no evidence that particular orders (like SVO) are used to disambiguate where the prefixal morphology fails to identify the subject and object clearly. It also notes that the commonest orders in a sample of transitive clauses were OV, SV, and VO, reflecting discourse-based preferences.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples illustrating each order for transitive clauses and notes that verb-initial orders are the rarest. It also mentions that all six orders exist in Kunwinjku, a related dialect, and provides additional exemplification of the commoner orderings.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the importance of word order in the organization of discourse in Bininj Gun-Wok but notes that its grammatical function is limited. It lists a few grammatical word order rules but emphasizes that grammatical relations do not determine order in Bininj Gun-Wok.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences with different word orders, showing that the language allows for various constituent orders.

5. **Paragraph 5** discusses the flexibility of word order in Bininj Gun-Wok and the lack of strict ordering constraints.

6. **Paragraph 6** mentions that there are no fixed word order rules for nominal words when they occur as part of a contiguous group, indicating a high degree of flexibility.

7. **Paragraph 7** discusses the integration of verbal and nominal material to construct referring expressions, further indicating the flexibility of word order.

8. **Paragraph 8** provides examples of sentences with different word orders, showing that the language allows for various constituent orders.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses the structure of the verbal word and the flexibility in the order of slots within the verb.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses the definition of grammatical relations and the flexibility in the representation of arguments on the verb.

11. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of sentences with different word orders, showing that the language allows for various constituent orders.

12. **Paragraph 12** discusses the use of subordinating conjunctions and the flexibility in the expression of subordinate clauses.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses the difficulty of identifying a phrase-like group due to the lack of ordering restrictions and the flexibility in the integration of verbal and nominal material.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wambaya,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Wambaya by examining the structure of sentences and the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the distinction between direct objects, second objects, and indirect objects, but does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that word order in verbless clauses is relatively free, but this does not directly inform us about the word order in verbal clauses.

3. **Paragraph 3**: States that the auxiliary is obligatory in every main verbal clause and usually occurs in the second position in the clause. This suggests that the verb (or auxiliary) might not always be in the initial position, but it does not provide a clear SVO/SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Provides an example with the verb ""finish"" but does not clearly show the order of subject, object, and verb.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Gives examples of verbs with complements but does not clarify the overall sentence structure.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses adjoined clauses and their modifiers but does not provide clear information on the main clause word order.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions that object NPs take the accusative case and provides examples of indirect objects, but does not clarify the dominant word order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses particles and clitics but does not provide information on the order of subject, object, and verb.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Defines subjects, objects, and indirect objects but does not provide clear examples of their order in sentences.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses reduplication patterns and parts of speech but does not provide information on sentence structure.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Provides an example of a subordinate clause but does not clarify the main clause word order.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the use of case suffixes in subordinate clauses but does not provide information on the main clause word order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses complex sentences and non-finite subordinate clauses but does not provide clear information on the main clause word order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Provides an example of a verb with multiple objects but does not clarify the overall sentence structure.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the auxiliary and its components but does not provide clear examples of sentence structure.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses final consonants in the auxiliary but does not provide information on sentence structure.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of simultaneous non-finite clauses but does not clarify the main clause word order.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Provides a table of basic argument structures and examples of impersonal verbs but does not provide clear information on the dominant word order.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses grammatical functions and their associations with semantic roles but does not provide clear examples of sentence structure.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses reflexive verbs and their argument structures but does not provide clear information on the dominant word order.

### Conclusion: No dominant order

The provided paragraphs do not offer sufficient information to determine a clear dominant word order for Wambaya. The examples and discussions focus more on the roles of grammatical functions, case marking, and auxiliary usage rather than providing clear patterns of subject, object, and verb placement in declarative sentences. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to conclusively determine the dominant word order.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wardaman,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a detailed analysis of the positioning of objects, subjects, and ergative-marked agents in Wardaman. It mentions that there is a tendency for nouns or noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verbal word rather than after it. However, it also notes that ergative-marked agents and objects show much less difference in position compared to subjects, which show a more marked tendency to occur before the verb. Specific examples given include orders such as VOA, OVA, and AVO, but no consistent dominant order is established.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph continues the discussion of ergative-marked agents and their positioning relative to the verb. It provides examples of AVO and OVA orders but does not establish a dominant word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where participants are presented as new and salient information, often in the first position of the tone unit. It shows variability in the order of constituents, with examples like SOV, SVO, and OVS, but again, no dominant order is established.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility in the ordering of modifiers within noun phrases but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the importance of prosodically defined units and their interaction with grammatical structure. It notes that there is a tendency for all three major syntactic functions (subject, object, ergative-marked agent) to occur preceding the verbal word, but this tendency is not strong enough to establish a dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the concept of ""free word order"" in Australian languages, including Wardaman. It suggests that while Wardaman exhibits greater freedom of ordering than languages like English, there is no clear dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of generic and specific terms within noun phrases but does not address clause-level word order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses noun phrase constituency and coordination but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses noun phrase structures and the flexibility of ordering within noun phrases but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of pronominal elements within the verb prefix system but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph continues the discussion of the verb prefix system and the ordering of pronominal elements but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph summarizes noun phrase constituency but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the distribution of object-marking elements within the verb prefix system but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses possessive constructions and the ordering of body parts within noun phrases but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

15. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph summarizes noun phrase structures and coordination but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses finite verbs and their marking for subject and object but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of qualifiers within noun phrases but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of demonstratives and qualifiers within noun phrases but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with two clauses within a single tone group but does not establish a dominant word order.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the co-occurrence of particles within a single clause but does not address the overall clause-level word order.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The descriptive grammar of Wardaman provides extensive information on the flexibility and variability of word order in different contexts, but it does not establish a clear dominant word order for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns.",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, several points can be noted regarding the word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V):

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses various grammatical elements such as postpositions, enclitics, and verb phrases. It mentions that the verb phrase (VP) consists of two obligatory constituents: a lexical 'head' referring to the process and a classifier complex (CC). However, it does not provide explicit examples of sentences with clear S, O, and V order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Focuses on oblique bound pronominals and their usage in verb phrases. It provides examples like ""wardbiringaddagi"" (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(1sg)O) 'come to me' and ""jagjawilimaanhi"" (speak-SUBJ-FUT+(1sg)N+MI-(3sg)O) 'I'll speak to him'. These examples show the verb at the end, suggesting a potential SOV order, but they are not conclusive as they involve pronominals rather than full noun phrases.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that Gooniyandi has a free word order in the sense that changing the order of constituents does not affect the referential or experiential meaning of a clause. However, it also states that Gooniyandi is a theme-first language, implying that the initial position in a sentence is often occupied by the thematic element, which could be the subject, object, or another constituent depending on the context.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples of sentences with different constituent orders. For instance, ""niyaji maa thoowoorndoo wabaari"" (this meat rotten it:smells) translates to 'This meat stinks,' where the subject ""niyaji maa"" (this meat) precedes the verb ""thoowoorndoo wabaari"" (it:smells). This suggests an SVO order in this example.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the use of spatial metaphors for expressing order and time but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that the verb phrase (VP) consists of two obligatory grammatical words in a fixed order, but does not specify the order of subject and object relative to the verb.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the order of pronominal prefixes and their relative status on a nominal hierarchy but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses clause complexes and the relationships between primary and secondary clauses but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions that lexical roots in Gooniyandi can occur in various syntagmatic environments but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the structure of the verb phrase and the use of classifiers but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Provides examples of existential clauses and their structure but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses information structure and the placement of focus in a clause but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Provides examples of existential clauses and their structure but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the structure of the verb phrase and the use of classifiers but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the use of thematic elements and reprise in sentences but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the use of pronominals in various functions but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the use of postpositions and their functions but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses identifying clauses and their structure but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the use of classifiers in verb phrases but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses the structure of the verb phrase and the use of classifiers but does not provide clear examples of S, O, and V order.

### Conclusion: No dominant order

The provided paragraphs do not offer sufficient evidence to determine a dominant word order for Gooniyandi. The language appears to have a flexible word order, with the possibility of different constituent orders depending on the context and thematic structure of the sentence. Therefore, the conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Tiwi by examining the examples and descriptions given in the text.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that in Modern Tiwi (MT), where there is only an uninflected verb, the word order has become rigid, being SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object). It also notes that where there is an inflected verb, there is greater freedom, but the normal order is still SPO. This suggests a tendency towards SVO order in declarative sentences.

2. **Paragraph 3** discusses that in Traditional Tiwi (TT), the clause may consist of just a verb, and most arguments of the verb may be indicated in the verb. This implies a flexible word order, but it does not provide a clear dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences in MT where the word order is SVO, especially in casual speech or children's speech. Examples like ""arra kilim awahi t"" (he is hitting us) and ""nyirra meykim tungabasket"" (she is making a basket) clearly follow the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 8** states that in TT, the unmarked order is SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object), but this may vary due to discourse considerations. This again suggests a preference for SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of transitive clauses in MT where the normal order is (S)PO, but when there is no overt subject, the order OP may occur. Examples like ""a-mpi-kirimi nakikirritawini"" (she got this bread) and ""ngiyayi-pini-me"" (he hit me) follow the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 17** mentions that in TT, the unmarked order is SPO, and this applies to both transitive and intransitive clauses. This reinforces the idea that SVO is the dominant order.

7. **Paragraph 18** discusses the word classes and mentions that the basic word order in TT is SVO but with much variation. This suggests that while there is flexibility, SVO is still the preferred order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Tiwi appears to be **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Nakkara,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nakkara, we can infer the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2** provides an example of an intransitive sentence: ""Mangaya_—ki+ddjiddaya-namother (S)she (S)laugh Vintr-PAST[VERB COMPLEX] Mother laughed."" This example shows the subject preceding the verb (S-V).

2. **Paragraph 3** describes a basic transitive clause: ""Ngiyakabba djabba kingarabba kinkalawabba Noni kinoranga kiyubbangiyana."" This sentence structure is more complex, but it indicates that the subject (S) and object (O) are both identified within the verb-complex (VC), suggesting a more flexible structure.

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the transitive verb-complex (VC) codes both the transitive subject (A) and the transitive object (O). This indicates that the verb-complex is central to the sentence structure, but it does not explicitly determine the order of S, O, and V outside the verb-complex.

4. **Paragraph 19** provides an example of a transitive sentence: ""Namurakka ngabanawuna Milak Wamud. namurakkanga=bana +wugoose (fem)I=them(A)=O)WamudMilak-na+give -PAST(name)(name)(©)I gave the goose to Milak and Wamud."" Here, the subject (I) precedes the verb (give), and the object (the goose) follows the verb, suggesting an SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 20** provides another example: ""Yingawa nawara kibbawana liyawa kikkaya barrngebana."" This sentence shows a sequence of actions with the subject (he) preceding the verb (left) and the object (the woman) following the verb, again suggesting an SVO order.

From these examples, it is evident that the subject generally precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb in transitive sentences. This pattern aligns with the SVO word order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Garrwa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, several key points emerge regarding the dominant word order in declarative sentences:

1. **Verb-Initial Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that in declarative sentences of positive polarity, the verb is the initial element of the core.
   - Paragraph 2 reinforces this by stating that Garrwa has a verb-initial basic word order.
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that the canonical word order in simple sentences can be represented by a template where the core (comprising the verb and TAM clitic) is followed by core argument nominal groups and adjuncts.

2. **Examples of Verb-Initial Sentences**:
   - Paragraph 3 provides examples where the verb appears first, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments (e.g., ""jungku nurr=i nana-ba"" - ""We stayed over there"").
   - Paragraph 6 and 7 provide further examples of sentences where the verb appears first, followed by pronouns and then nominal arguments (e.g., ""jilajba=yi nanda juka"" - ""That boy went"").

3. **Non-Canonical Orders**:
   - Paragraph 4 and 10 discuss non-canonical word orders that occur in marked pragmatic contexts, such as questions, negations, and focus constructions. However, these are explicitly described as departures from the canonical verb-initial order.

4. **Summary of Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 5 summarizes that Garrwa, like many other Australian languages, has a verb-initial order in simple declarative sentences, with nominal arguments and adjuncts following the core.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Ngankikurungkurr,"To determine the dominant word order in Ngankikurungkurr, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any explicit or implicit information about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses historical changes in verb structure and stress patterns but does not provide information on word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Similar to Paragraph 1, it focuses on stress patterns and historical verb structures without mentioning word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Provides an example (3-283) with a verb and object but lacks a clear subject, making it insufficient to determine word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses reflexive/reciprocal verbs and indirect object pronouns but does not provide a clear example of a declarative sentence with both subject and object nouns.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Talks about stress marking patterns in complex nominals and verbs but does not mention word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Describes word classes and their inflectional properties but does not provide information on the order of subject, object, and verb.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses morphological operations and stress on verbs but does not provide information on word order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Focuses on vowel occurrences and restrictions, not on word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the ordering of tense and aspect markers but does not provide information on word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Provides examples of complex verbs and their typical order but does not include both subject and object nouns in the examples.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions enclitics on a single NP but does not provide information on word order.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses reflexives and reciprocals with indirect object pronouns but does not provide a clear example of a declarative sentence with both subject and object nouns.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Provides an example (3-239) with a subject and object but the verb is a serialised auxiliary, making it complex to determine a clear word order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses motion/transfer verbs and case enclitics but does not provide information on word order.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses object suffixes and dual subject markers but does not provide a clear example of a declarative sentence with both subject and object nouns.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses vowel harmony in verbs but does not provide information on word order.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Provides an example (6-3) with a clear subject, object, and verb:
   - ""wa-wunu wupun-@-ta, e M-there 3sgSlash-3sg-hit and cl SU Perf DO wa-wunu-ninggi dam -© -pawal M -there-AGENT 3sgPoke-3sg-spear cl SU Perf DO""
   - Translation: ""He hit that man, then that man speared him.""
   - This example shows the order SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses indirect and direct object forms but does not provide information on word order.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses noun incorporation but does not provide information on word order.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses bodypart terms in lexical compounds but does not provide information on word order.

### Reasoning:
Based on the example provided in Paragraph 17, where the sentence structure is ""He hit that man, then that man speared him,"" the order of constituents is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This is the only clear example that includes both a subject and an object noun in a declarative sentence.

### Conclusion:
SOV",no dominant order,sov
Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, the following points are relevant to determining the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: States that Wagiman does not have a normal SOV order.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Indicates that it is rare for both A (agent) and O (object) to occur overtly in transitive clauses. The data shows a variety of orders but no clear dominant order.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the freedom of constituent order in Wagiman and mentions that 59 different sentence order types occur. It also notes that only 6 sentences contained both A and O, showing no strong order tendencies.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Explicitly states that there is a lack of evidence for any 'basic word order' in Wagiman and that it is extremely rare for sentences to contain free nominal expressions of both A and O.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Provides some statistical data showing that O tends to precede V and A, and Si (intransitive subject) tends to precede V, but this does not establish a dominant order.
6. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions that participles usually precede the finite verb, but this is about participle constructions rather than the main constituent order of S, O, and V.

From these points, it is clear that Wagiman exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, and no single order of S, O, and V is dominant. The grammar explicitly states that there is no basic word order and that the language has free word order influenced by pragmatic constraints.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the placement of subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph lists various clause structures, including ""Subject—Object—Verb"" (SOV) and ""Verb—Object"" (VO), among others. The presence of ""Subject—Object—Verb"" suggests that SOV might be a common structure.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with postposed subject pronouns and the placement of direct objects. The examples show that the default position for a direct object nominal is after the verb (VO), but also mention that the object can be fronted (OV). The examples provided (e.g., ""They take the dough"" and ""I shall bring food"") show a VO structure.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the copula clause and the placement of subjects and predicates. It shows that subjects are normally placed before predicates, which aligns with an SOV structure when combined with verbs.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the syntax of verbs and the placement of independent pronouns in direct object positions. The examples provided (e.g., ""How can I slaughter him?"" and ""They put it again in water"") show a VO structure.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with direct objects placed after verbs (VO) and sometimes before verbs (OV). The examples (e.g., ""He left his money there and went off"" and ""The young man came back from his cultivating"") show a VO structure.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the placement of adverbials and other components in clauses. The examples provided (e.g., ""One day he went down"" and ""They would make pieces of meat small like this"") show a VO structure.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the placement of the copula and subject constituents. The examples provided (e.g., ""They put the yoghurt in a churn"" and ""The house of Qara Te≥din has burnt down"") show a VO structure.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the placement of interrogative constituents and the nuclear stress in clauses. The examples provided (e.g., ""What did Barz6kko do?"" and ""What have you seen?"") show a VO structure.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the placement of adverbials and other components in clauses. The examples provided (e.g., ""They would make food"" and ""They would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls"") show a VO structure.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the placement of direct object nominals and the use of pronominal agreement. The examples provided (e.g., ""He lays down his load"" and ""She sees Leli°a"") show a VO structure.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the placement of the copula and subject constituents. The examples provided (e.g., ""The festival is a memorial"" and ""Our people fast for three days"") show an SOV structure.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the placement of the copula and subject constituents. The examples provided (e.g., ""The priest comes and ties the band"" and ""The band is a symbol"") show an SOV structure.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the placement of the copula and subject constituents. The examples provided (e.g., ""The young man came and gave me her scarf"" and ""That is all"") show an SOV structure.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on the consistent pattern of subject-initial clauses followed by objects and verbs, as well as the frequent occurrence of SOV structures in the provided examples.",sov,sov
English,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of English, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the relative positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""You heard their arguments"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph discusses the basic order of subject, predicator (verb), and object, illustrating that the default order in English is SVO. It also mentions that variations from this order (e.g., O before P) are ungrammatical.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""The moral objections are more important"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph reinforces the default position of the subject before the predicator and the object after the predicator, confirming the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""She took the others"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph compares canonical (SVO) with passive and preposing constructions, indicating that the basic, unmarked order is SVO.

4. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example: ""Who bought it?"" (SVO for declarative: ""Someone bought it"")
   - This paragraph discusses interrogative constructions but confirms that the declarative counterpart maintains the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example: ""You weren’t as ill as I had been"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph discusses postposing but indicates that the default order is SVO.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example: ""They offered all the overseas students one of the experienced tutors"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph discusses ditransitive constructions but maintains the SVO order for the main clause.

7. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Example: ""He always looks miserable"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph discusses the position of adverbs but confirms the SVO order for the main clause.

8. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example: ""He saw a gun on the desk"" (SVO)
   - This paragraph discusses postposing motivated by information status but confirms the SVO order for the main clause.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in English declarative sentences, where both the subject and the object are nouns, is **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Korean,"**Conclusion: SOV**

**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, the dominant word order in Korean is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The paragraph discusses various sentence structures and how the subject and object can be ambiguous without explicit case markers. However, it mentions that the object is more likely to be the element close to the verb, indicating a tendency towards SOV order. For example, ""Ayki (ka) emeni (lul) ponta"" translates to ""The baby looks at the mother,"" where the subject (Ayki) precedes the object (emeni) and the verb (ponta) comes last.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the object precedes the verb, such as ""Ilesen ul kho lul mancinla"" (""I touch the toe of the sock"") and ""Cokhl lul pung ul ssullinta"" (""I have my nephew sweep the room""). These examples consistently show the object preceding the verb, reinforcing the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 8**: It states that a Korean sentence can have more than one subject but ordinarily only one direct object, and provides examples like ""Nwu ka meli ka aph,un ya"" (""Who has a headache?"") and ""Nwu ka meli lul alh.nun ya"" (""Who is sick in the head?""). The structure of these sentences aligns with the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 9**: The paragraph discusses the expansion of sentences by adding adverbial phrases and mentions that the verb typically comes at the end, as in ""Cikum emeni ka ayki lul ponta"" (""Now the mother looks at the baby""). This again supports the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 10**: It describes various sentence structures and the use of the accusative particle ""ul/lul"" to mark direct objects, which typically precede the verb, further indicating an SOV order.

Overall, the examples and explanations provided in the paragraphs consistently show that the subject comes first, followed by the object, and the verb comes last, confirming that the dominant word order in Korean is SOV.",sov,sov
Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that the SOV order is considered 'neutral' or 'basic' in Basque. It states that while the preverbal object in this order need not be interpreted as 'emphatic', any other preverbal argument in any other order is usually construed as focalized. This indicates that SOV is the unmarked or default word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that the basic unmarked order in Basque is subject-object, and the verb typically appears in the final position. It mentions that when there is a constraint on the relative order of arguments, it is always the subject-object order that is required, and the verb-final character of Basque is evident in various syntactic structures.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph also supports the SOV order as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order. It mentions that most Basque grammarians have identified SOV as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order and provides examples that follow this pattern.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the verb-final ordering in predicative and equative constructions, further supporting the SOV order as the most neutral one.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph mentions that while the neutral position of nominal objects is preverbal, heavy elements, especially clauses, tend to occur to the right. This indicates that the basic word order is SOV, but there are exceptions for heavier constituents.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the prominence of the word preceding the verb, which aligns with the SOV order where the object or another constituent immediately precedes the verb.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions that the standard word order in a Basque finite clause has the auxiliary following the verb, which is consistent with a verb-final (SOV) structure.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in embedded clauses but does not contradict the SOV order as the basic structure.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the possibility of multiple phrases constituting new information, but it still aligns with the SOV order as the basic structure.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the strong word order constraint in relative clauses, where the verb must appear at the end, supporting the verb-final (SOV) structure.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses gapping structures and mentions that Basque has patterns consistent with SOV languages.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions that emphasized constituents must follow the neutral order (Subject-Adjuncts-Indirect Object-Direct Object), which aligns with the SOV order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph mentions that multiple wh-words can occur in a fixed order identical to the neutral one, which is SOV.

14. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of relative pronouns and verbs in relative clauses, supporting the verb-final (SOV) structure.

15. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order with multiple wh-words but does not contradict the SOV order as the basic structure.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the unacceptability of certain word orders within relative clauses, reinforcing the verb-final (SOV) structure.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of verbs in relative clauses, supporting the verb-final (SOV) structure.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in headless relative clauses but does not contradict the SOV order as the basic structure.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the intonational division of an utterance and mentions that the constituent with the most prominent pitch accent appears postverbally in some varieties, but this does not contradict the SOV order as the basic structure.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in finite complement clauses but does not contradict the SOV order as the basic structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information to determine the dominant word order in Malayalam.

**Paragraph 1:**
- ""Though the verb usually occupies the final position in the sentence as in the examples of 1.1.1 it may be noted that word order is not rigid as seen below.""
  - This indicates that the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence, suggesting an SOV order, but also mentions that the word order is not rigid.

**Paragraph 3:**
- ""Let me give her this child. 613)003 r3I3nJOo(S8 u 6D1> n^|CT^<6jo""
  - This example shows a verb-final structure, supporting the SOV order.

**Paragraph 6:**
- ""1.1.2f3t5,6no° ^fm^ is the copula verb connecting two nouns or noun phrases or pronouns and nouns to form an equational type of sentence.""
  - This paragraph discusses the use of the copula verb, which is not directly relevant to the SOV structure but provides context for sentence construction.

**Paragraph 13:**
- ""Build up drill provides the learners with ample opportunities to practise the normal word order of the sentence and helps them memorise the sentence through a systematic building up of the same by a progressive addition of words in the given order.""
  - This suggests that there is a ""normal"" or preferred word order that learners are encouraged to practice, implying a dominant word order exists.

**Paragraph 14:**
- ""It is he who tells the mattertstotuoft cSjOro^fflOQa/lfracrro OJO6TOTOTO»0""
  - This example also shows a verb-final structure, reinforcing the SOV order.

From the above analysis, it is evident that the verb typically occupies the final position in Malayalam sentences, indicating a dominant SOV word order. Although the word order is not rigid and can vary, the dominant pattern is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mien, the dominant word order in the language can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

   - **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph argues against the common view that Iu Mien is an SVO language, suggesting that SVO order in isolation is rare and that word order is better explained by pragmatic principles, with Topic occurring preverbally and Focus postverbally.
   
   - **Paragraph 2**: While it mentions that Iu Mien shows an 'SVO' order in pragmatically neutral clauses, it also hints at object-fronting for discourse-pragmatic purposes, indicating flexibility in word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 3**: States that the basic constituent order is still SVO, even with modifications like adverbs or aspectual verbs.
   
   - **Paragraph 4**: Describes Iu Mien as a verb-medial language but emphasizes that it does not have a strictly grammaticalized SVO pattern.
   
   - **Paragraph 5**: Explicitly states that an isolated SVO order is rare and that Iu Mien, like Thai and Lao, uses word order to indicate grammatical relations without case marking.
   
   - **Paragraph 6**: Reinforces the idea that Iu Mien is not primarily an SVO language and that pragmatics play a more important role in word-order choice.
   
   - **Paragraph 7**: Mentions that in certain subgroups of clauses, a V–NP (seemingly VS) order is observed, adding to the variability in word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the distinction between [V-NP] and [NP-V] constructions, indicating variability in word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 9**: Argues that the verb-medial word order does not necessarily mean SVO, and introduces the concept of event-presentative constructions.
   
   - **Paragraph 10**: Describes Iu Mien as a topic-prominent language rather than an SVO language, with a common sentence structure of topic-on-the-left and comment-on-the-right.
   
   - **Paragraph 11**: Supports the idea that Iu Mien has a verb-medial order with pragmatic assignment of Topic and Focus, rather than a strict SVO order.
   
   - **Paragraph 12**: Compares Iu Mien with Thai and argues that Iu Mien should be described in its own terms, emphasizing the pragmatic principles that determine word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 13**: Lists principles that include topic-focus orientation and verb-medial word order, not necessarily SVO.
   
   - **Paragraph 14**: Defines the basic constituent order at the sentence level as involving Topic and Focus, with optional elements.
   
   - **Paragraph 15**: States that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language with pragmatically assigned positions for Topic and Focus, which may appear as SVO but are not strictly grammaticalized.
   
   - **Paragraph 16**: Provides an example of a VP-NP structure, indicating flexibility in word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 17**: Suggests that the speaker’s attitude and perception influence word order.
   
   - **Paragraph 18**: Emphasizes the dominance of the topic-focus order in actual speech events and discourse.
   
   - **Paragraph 19**: Discusses argument structures and mentions V-NP and NP-V constructions, indicating variability.
   
   - **Paragraph 20**: Explains that the order of NP1 and NP2 in a two-argument structure affects the meaning, indicating that word order is flexible and context-dependent.

Given the consistent emphasis on the role of pragmatics, topic-focus orientation, and the variability in word order, it is clear that Iu Mien does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, the word order is flexible and influenced by pragmatic factors.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Semelai, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

   - **Paragraph 1** mentions that many clauses consist only of a verb or a verb and pronominal proclitic, complicating the characterization of a basic constituent order.
   
   - **Paragraph 2** describes the universal clause where the constituent order is AVO (Agent-Verb-Object), exemplified by ""podorj ca sma?"" (tiger eat people).
   
   - **Paragraph 3** states that in transitive clauses, the ordering is usually verb-initial, although any argument may be pre-verbal.
   
   - **Paragraph 5** emphasizes that constituent order in Semelai is fluid and determined by various factors, including transitivity and discourse organization. It notes a tendency for verb-initial structures in transitive clauses.
   
   - **Paragraph 6** reinforces that the most frequently employed constituent order is verb-initial, with either A and O, or S placed after the verb.
   
   - **Paragraph 9** mentions that although both OV and VO are allowable orders in simple clauses, the preferred pattern in concatenated clauses appears to be VO.
   
   - **Paragraph 14** indicates that post-verbal NPs are permissible, reflecting the main clause word order VS (Verb-Subject).

From these observations, it is clear that while Semelai exhibits fluidity in its constituent order, there is a notable preference for verb-initial structures, particularly in transitive clauses. This suggests a dominant VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) order, with flexibility allowing for other orders based on pragmatic and discourse factors.

2. **Conclusion:**
   VSO",no dominant order,vso
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can analyze the dominant word order as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the most frequent word order in terms of core constituents is subject-object-verb (SOV). It also mentions that the word order is flexible, particularly in finite clauses, and follows a discourse-oriented scheme. However, the dominant order remains SOV.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses deviations from the SOV order, such as right dislocation and clause-initial objects, indicating that while SOV is the norm, other orders can occur under specific conditions.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that the most frequent word order is verb-final, which aligns with the SOV structure. It also mentions that the relative order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph states that the word order patterns in Kolyma Yukaghir are overwhelmingly head-final, which includes SOV in non-finite clauses and a preference for SOV in main clauses.

5. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph mentions that the word-order rules prohibit placing the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position before the A constituent, reinforcing the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the split intransitivity in Yukaghir, where the S participant can take either Nominative or Predicative marking, but it does not contradict the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences that follow the SOV order, further supporting the dominance of this structure.

Overall, the evidence from these paragraphs consistently points to SOV as the dominant word order in Yukaghir (Kolyma), despite some flexibility and specific discourse conditions that allow for variations.

Thai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Thai can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. 

**Paragraph 6** is particularly relevant as it explicitly states:
> ""The general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is Subject-Verb-Object as in English.""

This statement directly indicates that the typical word order in Thai is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

Additionally, **Paragraph 15** provides an example of a passive construction and mentions:
> ""The second example given above is the more common form of construction and should be particularly noted, as the word order: Subject-TOOK-Agent-Verb.""

Although this paragraph discusses passive constructions, it reinforces the idea that the subject typically precedes the verb, aligning with an SVO structure in active sentences.

**Paragraph 7** also supports this by showing a question structure:
> ""DEK NUN PEN LOOK KORNG KRY KA"" (Whose child is that?)
> (That child is the child of who?)

This example, while a question, maintains the subject (DEK NUN) preceding the verb (PEN), consistent with an SVO order.

### Conclusion:

   - Neutral sentences conform to the SOV structure.
   - Example sentences provided (56a, 56b) illustrate SOV order.
   - It mentions that the word order can be flexible depending on the information structure, but SOV is statistically the most frequent.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Reiterates that Nganasan is a head-final language with SOV as the statistically most common word order.
   - Provides examples of simple intransitive sentences and mentions that transitive sentences typically include subject, object, and predicate, with the subject often in the sentence-initial position.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Provides examples of sentences where the subject and object are dropped due to pro-drop characteristics but maintains the SOV structure when all elements are present.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Discusses causative structures and other sentence types but does not contradict the SOV order for declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Discusses existential and locative clauses, which are not directly relevant to determining the basic word order of declarative sentences with both subject and object.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Provides examples of sentences with different structures but maintains the SOV order in declarative sentences.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses interrogative sentences and their structures, indicating that word order can vary in questions but does not contradict the SOV order for declarative sentences.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Discusses nominal inflection and possessive constructions, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order of declarative sentences.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Provides examples of sentences with different structures but maintains the SOV order in declarative sentences.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Discusses verbal valence and the argument structure of verbs, indicating that the subject and object are typically marked and follow the SOV order.

Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the usual word order in Nivkh is topic - embedded clause - adverbials - subject - causee - secondary object - primary object - predicate. This suggests a final position for the predicate, indicating an SOV structure.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that Nivkh is a head-marking SOV language with a fairly consistent final predicate position. This directly supports the SOV word order.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides an example of word order with ditransitive verbs: Subject - Secondary Object - Primary Object - Predicate. This again places the verb at the end, consistent with SOV.

4. **Paragraph 11** describes the focus position and mentions that the primary object is 'excorporated' and fronted, freeing the pre-predicate position for the focus. This implies that the default position of the primary object is before the verb, supporting SOV.

5. **Paragraph 14** discusses the undergoer-verb complex and mentions that the undergoer appears in the clause-initial position when topicalized, while a prefix takes its place on the verb. This suggests that the default position of the undergoer (object) is before the verb, consistent with SOV.

6. **Paragraph 18** provides a verb template and mentions that the undergoer of a transitive verb is encoded either in prefixal, pronominal, or nominal form, or represented by a characteristic initial sound. The template shows the verb at the end, supporting SOV.

7. **Paragraph 19** mentions that Nivkh has a fixed SOV word order, reinforcing the conclusion.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov

**SOV**",sov,sov
Nahali,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Nihali language, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the word order in Nihali is SOV. It mentions that while the normal word order is SOV, it is possible to have OSV in cases of focusing. The example given is:
   - **tembrya dho:r-na cekiya** (tiger-sub cow-obj catch-pt) - SOV
   - **dho:r-na tembrya cekiya** (cow-obj tiger-sub catch-pt) - OSV
   This indicates that the dominant word order is SOV, with flexibility for other orders in specific contexts.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that the word order is SOV, similar to Korku, Indo-Aryan, and Dravidian languages. This paragraph emphasizes the simplicity and analytic nature of Nihali's word order compared to other languages.

3. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences where the verb typically ends the sentence, reinforcing the SOV structure:
   - **biḍiphera biḍimanso tembra:n paḍa:yḍa:n** (once one man tiger kill-had) - SOV
   - **jo daccophera cergi** (I ten times run-pt) - SOV

4. **Paragraph 6** includes examples of compound sentences where the verb appears at the end of each clause, maintaining the SOV order:
   - **biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil koya** (one hand-in stick and one hand-in lantern taking) - SOV

5. **Paragraph 12** provides a paradigm illustrating the verb ""to sleep"" (kapp-) and shows that the verb follows the subject, maintaining the SOV order:
   - **jo kappo-ka** (I sleep) - SOV
   - **jo kappo-ken** (I will sleep) - SOV

6. **Paragraph 13** discusses complex sentences where the subordinate clause precedes the main clause, but the main clause itself follows the SOV order:
   - **jo e:riḍa:n eṭeyna a:wa:rki / kay/ eṭey a:wa:rki beṭhe ḍa:n** (I went his house-to so/then he house-in neg was) - SOV

7. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of transitive and intransitive verbs, showing that the verb follows the subject and object, maintaining the SOV structure:
   - **iṭimanso tandur ṭye** (that-man rice eat-pt) - SOV
   - **jo si:sin bheṭṭikamay** (I bottle-obj break-make-pt) - SOV

From these examples and explicit statements, it is clear that the dominant word order in Nihali is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Kusunda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Kusunda grammar, we can analyze the word order in Kusunda by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns, and the verb (V) is finite.

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - Example (258b): ""pyana tsi agai-da pumba-d-i"" translates to ""Yesterday I dog-ACC beat-1-PAST"" or ""Yesterday I beat the dog.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-dog-beat).
   - Example (257a): ""tsi pyana ts-˙g-˙n"" translates to ""I yesterday 1-go-REAL"" or ""I went yesterday.""
     - Here, the order is SV (I-went).

2. **Paragraph 9:**
   - Example (309a): ""hab˙-g-i amba"" translates to ""roast-3-PAST meat"" or ""meat that he roasted.""
     - Here, the order is VOS (roast-meat-he).
   - Example (309b): ""na tsi d~aba-d-i gimi, n˙n-da e-d-u-wa"" translates to ""This I find-1-PAST money, you-ACC give-1-IRR-NEG"" or ""This is money that I found, I will not give it to you.""
     - Here, the order is SVO (I-found-money).

3. **Paragraph 10:**
   - Example (116a): ""t-˙m-da t-ug-un"" translates to ""1-eat-PURP 1-come-REAL"" or ""I came to eat.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-eat-came).
   - Example (116b): ""tsi wi ˙n-da ol~aˆ -t-ßn"" translates to ""I house make-PURP want-1-REAL"" or ""I want to build a house.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-house-make-want).

4. **Paragraph 14:**
   - Example (226d): ""na tsi kila-d-ßn gimi"" translates to ""this I steal-1-REAL money"" or ""This is money that I stole.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-money-steal).

5. **Paragraph 19:**
   - Example (147b): ""tul-a-t-ßn"" translates to ""dress-do-1-REAL"" or ""I dressed (someone).""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-dress-do).
   - Example (148b): ""bem-˙-t-ßn"" translates to ""fall-do-1-REAL"" or ""I made (someone) fall.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (I-fall-do).

From these examples, it is evident that the dominant word order in Kusunda is SOV. This is consistent across multiple examples where both the subject and object are nouns, and the verb is finite.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the examples and the explicit statements about word order.

1. **Paragraph 3** provides clear examples of SOV order:
   - ""Mamasa ule:-we olokto-ini."" (The old woman is cooking meat.)
   - ""Omölo-i wopti-we kimpigi-e-ni."" (My granddaughter closed the door.)
   - ""Cinda-ziga jegdige ag'a-du kuge-we kuge:-ti."" (The birds blew (the fire) with bellows for the brother hero.)

2. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states that Udihe exhibits features of a head-final SOV language and that SOV is the most common statistically:
   - ""Udihe exhibits certain typological features of a head-final SOV language... Indeed, the SOV order is the most common statistically as well.""

3. **Paragraph 7** discusses the importance of the preverbal position of the focus element, which often results in the SOV order:
   - ""The most important requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position of the focus element. In a clause that does not involve any constituents other than SOV, this, under normal discourse conditions, results in the preverbal position of the object.""

4. **Paragraph 16** mentions that the finite verb normally occupies the clause-final position in yes-no questions, which aligns with an SOV structure:
   - ""The finite verb normally occupies the clause-final position.""

5. **Paragraph 14** reiterates that Udihe is a head-final SOV language, although head-finality is not rigid:
   - ""Udihe is a head-final SOV language. However, head-finality is not rigid.""

6. **Paragraph 19** indicates that adverbials and other elements can be positioned freely as long as the preverbal focus requirement is satisfied, which supports the flexibility within an overall SOV structure:
   - ""In general, there is a certain freedom of adverbial positioning, as long as the main requirement of Udihe word order, the preverbal position of the focus element, is satisfied.""

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can analyze the dominant word order in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Head-Final Language**:
   - Ingush is described as a consistently head-final language except for predominantly verb-second order in main clauses (Paragraph 1).

2. **Verb-Final Order**:
   - Verb-final order is used in non-main and some main clauses (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples of verb-final order include pragmatically neutral main clauses and elicited simple sentences with no context (Paragraph 2).

3. **Basic Order of Arguments**:
   - The grammatically most basic order of arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV (Paragraph 3).
   - This order is not rigid, and the arguments can have different orders relative to each other and (in main clauses) to the verb (Paragraph 3).

4. **Verb-Second Order**:
   - For main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, verb-second order is most common (Paragraph 7).
   - The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form, follows the first word or phrase in the clause (Paragraph 7).

5. **Examples and Patterns**:
   - Examples such as ""Muusaaz suona telefon tiexar"" (Musa telephoned me) show verb-final order in episode-initial clauses (Paragraph 8).
   - Verb-final order is found without exception in non-main clauses of all kinds (Paragraph 8).

6. **Existential, Locative, and Possessive Sentences**:
   - The basic or neutral order in these sentences is A patterner + O patterner + V (Paragraph 13).

7. **Focus and Topic**:
   - In Ingush, both a topic and a focus can precede the verb (Paragraph 15).
   - Pure contrastive focus is on a non-fronted immediately preverbal element, which is one of the readings of a sentence in basic AOV order (Paragraph 12).

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided, the dominant word order in Ingush is **AOV** (Agent-Object-Verb), which aligns with the description of verb-final order in pragmatically neutral main clauses and non-main clauses. The verb-second order in main clauses is also noted but does not override the dominant AOV pattern in neutral contexts.

**Conclusion: AOV**",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can analyze the dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** states that clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e., verb-final. It mentions that verb-final order is the preferred word order in independent sentences, although alternative orders are possible, especially in colloquial language. It also notes a strong tendency for the subject to precede other arguments.

2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces that the finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. It provides examples where the verb follows the object and other constituents of the clause.

3. **Paragraph 3** introduces the chapter on clause syntax, indicating that word order at the clause level is discussed in detail.

4. **Paragraph 4** mentions that the order of arguments with respect to each other is determined by information structure rather than grammatical relations, with given information tending to precede new information. However, it reiterates that the subject most often precedes other arguments.

5. **Paragraph 5** provides an overview of Lezgian grammar, stating that word order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final and that SOV order is preferred for clauses.

6. **Paragraph 6** discusses conditions under which non-verb-final word order is usual, such as in the formulaic beginning of a fairy tale or in direct speech in narrative prose, especially in questions and emphatic or emotional speech.

7. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** focus on word order within noun phrases, which is strictly head-final, and do not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb in clauses.

8. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** reiterate the general tendency for elements of a constituent to be adjacent and mention that discontinuous noun phrases are prohibited in Lezgian.

9. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** provide additional context on the syntax of the clause, emphasizing the head-final nature of Lezgian word order.

10. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** discuss the structure of the grammar and the importance of word order at the clause level.

11. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss adverbial clauses and their tendency to precede the verb, reinforcing the verb-final nature of Lezgian syntax.

12. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** provide examples of sentences with verb-final order, further supporting the SOV structure.

13. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss verbal valence patterns and the role of different arguments, again emphasizing the head-final, verb-final nature of Lezgian syntax.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Lezgian is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by multiple references to the verb-final nature of the language and the tendency for the subject to precede other arguments. 

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Galo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns.

Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and explanations given.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses various sentence structures and provides examples of sentences with different word orders. It mentions that the syntactic relationship among the verb and two argument NPs is unambiguous due to their inflections with double marking. It also states that any one of the six possible orders for the three items involved have no substantial difference, although the order SOV is likely to occur more commonly than others.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the word order is flexible. It shows that the verb can come sentence-initially, and the subject and object can follow in any order. However, it also suggests a tendency towards placing the subject before the object, indicating a preference for SOV order.

Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the examples and descriptions of constituent order within the clause.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text explicitly states that ""Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final,"" and provides several examples where the verb is at the end of the clause.
   - Example (1): ""muš-ąk-wičk sum moˀos"" translates to ""you fellows laughed yesterday,"" with the verb ""laughed"" at the end.
   - Example (2): ""t ’uk’-tl hąw ˀi"" translates to ""I like to gig (hunt) fish,"" with the verb ""gig"" at the end.
   - Example (3): ""kiˀ=ąt saˀak č an=k"" translates to ""he gave me his (someone else’s) baby,"" with the verb ""gave"" at the end.
   - Example (4) shows multiple clauses in connected speech, all with verbs at the end.
   - The text also mentions that non-verb-final word order occurs in specific contexts, such as complement clauses following quotations.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The brief grammatical overview reiterates that ""Yuki clauses are generally verb-final, though other word orders are also observed.""

3. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (100): ""Coyote’s fur was yellowish because he had been scorched,"" with the verb ""had been scorched"" at the end.
   - Example (101): ""Many Wailaki shall speak Wailaki speech because I do this,"" with the verb ""do"" at the end.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (95): ""And as they caught him they questioned,"" with the verb ""questioned"" at the end.
   - Example (96): ""Then they traveled to where Spider was holding down the fire,"" with the verb ""holding down"" at the end.
   - Example (97): ""And brought it to where he was standing,"" with the verb ""standing"" at the end.

From these examples and descriptions, it is clear that the verb-final order is predominant in Yuki clauses. The consistent placement of the verb at the end of the clause in various examples supports this conclusion.

### Conclusion:

Pipil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the frequency and context of different word orders in declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Examples of OV and SV orders are given, but these are noted to emphasize the object or subject, respectively.
   - Examples of VOS order are not explicitly mentioned here.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It is stated that Pipil word order is ""relatively free"" and pragmatically determined.
   - The most natural order for intransitive sentences is Verb-Subject (VS).
   - The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS). This order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest frequency in texts and conversation and is neutral with respect to focus and emphasis.
   - Other orders like SVO and VSO occur but are less frequent and often used for emphasis or with ""heavy"" objects.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Reiterates that intransitive sentences rarely deviate from the basic VS order.
   - Verb-Object (VO) is common in transitive sentences where the subject is pronominal.
   - Verb-Subject (VS) also occurs in transitive sentences when the object is pronominal.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Discusses copular sentences and the order of modifiers but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order of declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - When the subject is a full, independent pronoun, it always precedes the verb, resulting in Subject(=pron.)-Verb(-Object) order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Provides examples of verb phrases and other constructions but does not directly address the dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses pronominal object prefixes but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Provides examples of relativized subjects and objects but does not directly address the dominant word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Discusses questions and their structure but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Provides examples of verb + verb forms but does not directly address the dominant word order.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Discusses grammatical categories and morphology but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

12. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Provides examples of reduplication and plural formation but does not directly address the dominant word order.

    - Provides examples of cleft sentences but does not directly address the dominant word order.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Discusses adjectives and their forms but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Provides examples of numbers and locatives but does not directly address the dominant word order.

16. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Discusses phonological processes but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

17. **Paragraph 17**:
    - Provides examples of verb morphology but does not directly address the dominant word order.

18. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Provides examples of purpose clauses but does not directly address the dominant word order.

19. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Discusses verb classes and their morphology but does not provide additional information on the dominant word order.

20. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Provides examples of coordinate constructions but does not directly address the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the dominant word order in Pipil is **VOS**. This order is described as the most common neutral order for transitive sentences and occurs with the greatest frequency in texts and conversation, making it the basic word order for the language. 

**Conclusion: VOS**",no dominant order,vos
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Micmac can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the ""Object copy"" is always closest to the verb. This suggests that the object tends to appear near the verb, but it does not conclusively determine the overall word order.

2. **Paragraph 3** states that in transitive verbs, copies of both the object and subject must appear after the verb stem in some order, with a preference for the object copy to precede the subject copy. This implies that the verb comes first, followed by the object and then the subject, suggesting a VOS order.

3. **Paragraph 4** reinforces this by stating that the object marker precedes the subject marker following the verb stem in the structure.

4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 10** both describe structures where the verb appears first, followed by the subject and object in some order. Specifically, Paragraph 10 mentions deriving a structure where the subject and object are right daughters of the verb, implying a verb-initial structure.

5. **Paragraph 12** mentions that certain forms appear in subject-object order by a specific rule, but this does not contradict the verb-initial structure suggested by other paragraphs.

6. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 19** do not provide direct information about the word order but discuss transformations and rules that affect the placement of markers and morphemes.

Overall, the evidence points towards a verb-initial structure with the object often preceding the subject, suggesting a VOS order.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tepehua (Huehuetla), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the statistical frequencies and examples of word orders in transitive clauses.

1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Table 32 shows that out of 569 transitive clauses, the most frequent word orders with two overt arguments are SVO (2.6%), VSO (2.3%), OVS (0.9%), VOS (0.7%), OSV (0.2%), and SOV (0%). This indicates that SVO and VSO are the most common orders when both subject and object are present.
   - **Paragraph 4**: Table 34 reiterates that among the 38 transitive clauses with two arguments, SVO (39.5%) and VSO (34.2%) are the most frequent, followed by OVS (13.2%) and VOS (10.5%).

2. **Examples and Context**:
   - **Paragraph 3**: Example (734) shows that in pragmatically neutral clauses, the fixed word order is VSO. However, SVO is also readily accepted by speakers.
   - **Paragraph 7**: The summary indicates that in texts with ample context and pragmatic cues, SVO is somewhat more frequent than VSO, but both orders are dominant.

3. **Conclusion from Analysis**:
   - The statistical data and examples suggest that while both SVO and VSO are used, SVO has a slight edge in frequency. This aligns with the general observation that SVO and VSO are the dominant orders in Tepehua (Huehuetla).

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Musqueam can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph is quite fragmented and difficult to parse, but it mentions structures where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the verb, suggesting an SVO order. However, the information is not conclusive due to the fragmented nature of the text.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that in certain structures, the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the verb, which again suggests an SVO order. However, it also mentions other structures where the verb precedes the subject and object, indicating variability.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides a clearer indication of word order. It mentions that pluralized objects and subjects occur in the order SVO, with the subject preceding the verb and the object following the verb.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the expression of subjects and objects in verb phrases, but it does not provide explicit information about their order relative to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph mentions subjects and objects in relation to verb suffixes but does not provide clear information about their order in declarative sentences.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions an example where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the verb, which supports an SVO order.

From the information provided, there is a recurring pattern where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the verb, suggesting that the dominant word order in Musqueam is SVO. However, there are also indications of variability in word order, which might suggest some flexibility.

**Conclusion: SVO**",vso,svo
Omaha,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Omaha by examining the relative positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 4:**
   - ""Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after their nouns, whether these are subject or object.""
   - Example: ""[The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse (object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].""
   - This example clearly shows the order SOV.

2. **Paragraph 3:**
   - ""In Omaha, the verb follows the noun.""
   - This supports the observation that verbs come after both subjects and objects, reinforcing an SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 2:**
   - ""In Omaha, the order is reversed. The head verb comes last, and any modifying verbs precede it in the reverse of the order they would appear in an English sentence.""
   - This indicates that verbs tend to come at the end of clauses, which is consistent with SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 9:**
   - ""In Omaha a verb can stand alone as a complete sentence, without needing a subject in front of it as in English. The subject is implied.""
   - While this indicates that verbs can stand alone, it does not contradict the SOV order when both subject and object are present.

### Conclusion:
The dominant word order in Omaha is SOV.

### Reasoning:
The examples and descriptions provided in the paragraphs consistently show that verbs follow both the subject and the object in declarative sentences. This is indicative of an SOV word order.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov

### Conclusion:
Not mentioned in the grammar.",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, we can analyze the dominant word order as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object, verb (SOV). This is a clear indication of the dominant word order in Koasati.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the order with the object following the verb (SVO) is quite unusual and occurs only in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the verbal element. This reinforces that SVO is not the dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses word order variation and the influence of nominal cases and verb prominence but does not contradict the dominant SOV order stated in Paragraph 1.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples and further details about the positioning of subjects and objects, supporting the SOV structure as the most unmarked position.

5. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss variations and specific contexts where the verb might be moved forward, but these are marked constructions and do not represent the dominant order.

6. **Paragraph 10** mentions that the noun must precede the verb when word order alone is sufficient to indicate that the noun is the object of the verb, which aligns with the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 14** provides examples where the subject and object are positioned before the verb, consistent with the SOV order.

In summary, the grammar consistently indicates that the unmarked or dominant word order in Koasati is SOV, with other orders being used in specific, marked contexts.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Chumash (Barbareño),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly states that a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure.
   - The verb-initial word order occurs in independent clauses as well as dependent clauses.
   - Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and typically not part of the clause that follows.
   - Examples provided in this paragraph also illustrate the VOS order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph provides multiple examples of sentences that follow the VOS order.
   - Example (244) shows a verb-object-subject structure: ""Right then the Indians lowered their arrows.""
   - Example (245) also follows the VOS structure: ""and a white cloth covered her face.""
   - Example (246) continues with the VOS structure: ""When a rattlesnake bites a person.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph does not provide relevant information about the word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph discusses the positioning of adverbial clauses and does not directly address the basic word order of subject, object, and verb.

### Conclusion: VOS

The dominant word order in Barbareño Chumash is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS).",vos,vos
Yuchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the basic word order in a two-place verb (transitive sentence) is Actor (A) then Patient (P), then Verb (V). This corresponds to the SOV order.
2. **Paragraph 3** reinforces this by showing that the basic word order for ""Sissy loves Sonny"" is Sissy (A) Sonny (P) siothashane (V), which is again SOV.
3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that in causative constructions, the order is Causer (A) [Affected Patient (P) V(Effect)] V(Cause), which also aligns with the SOV structure.
4. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** both mention the P-A-V order for pronominal prefixes on the verb, which supports the SOV structure in terms of the linear order of pronominal prefixes.

These consistent references to the Actor (Subject) - Patient (Object) - Verb order across different contexts and constructions in the language strongly indicate that the dominant word order in Yuchi is SOV.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar explicitly states the basic word order as APV (SOV) in multiple instances.
- Examples provided consistently follow the SOV order.
- The structure of pronominal prefixes on the verb also supports the SOV order.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the nominal object must appear after the verb but may precede or follow the subject of the sentence. This suggests a preference for the verb-object (VO) sequence, but the subject's position is more flexible.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that the subject of a sentence may appear in initial, medial, or terminal position, indicating flexibility in the placement of the subject.
3. **Paragraph 12** notes that the verb appears in what may be termed terminal position, reinforcing the idea that the verb often comes last in the sentence.

Given these observations, the evidence points towards a dominant word order where the verb typically follows the object, and the subject can be more variable in its position. This aligns most closely with the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order, where the verb is placed at the end of the sentence.

**Reasoning:**
- The requirement for the nominal object to appear after the verb (VO) and the flexibility of the subject's position suggest that the verb tends to come last.
- The subject's flexible positioning (initial, medial, or terminal) does not contradict the SOV order, as it can still fit within this structure if the verb is consistently placed at the end.

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, it is challenging to determine the dominant word order directly. However, we can infer some information from the given text:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions a ""subject prefix"" that identifies the person who is the subject of the verb. This suggests that subjects are marked in a specific way, but it does not provide clear information about the overall word order.

2. **Paragraph 3** states that modes in Arikara are expressed by prefixes to the verb and that different modes take different prefixes. It also mentions that these modes do not require changes in word order in the sentence as in English. This implies that word order might be relatively fixed, but it does not specify what that order is.

3. **Paragraph 4** discusses a ""pronoun prefix"" that identifies the person or thing receiving the action of the verb. It also mentions that what is the subject in English translation is the object in Arikara inflection. This indicates that the language has a different syntactic structure compared to English, but it does not clarify the dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 5** indicates that the order of word parts remains the same in negative and declarative sentences. This suggests some consistency in word order, but again, it does not specify what that order is.

5. **Paragraph 9** mentions that the active verb describes an action performed by the subject, similar to English. However, it does not provide information about the placement of the subject, object, and verb in a sentence.

6. **Paragraph 10** discusses verb forms and modes but does not provide information about the order of subject, object, and verb.

7. **Paragraph 13** describes how verbs are used with different kinds of clothing, indicating that the verb form changes based on the context, but it does not provide information about the overall sentence structure.

8. **Paragraph 14** lists subject, verb form, and indicative prefix in a column, but it does not provide a clear sentence structure.

Given the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the dominant word order in Arikara. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of grammar, such as prefixes, verb forms, and modes, but they do not provide a clear indication of the dominant order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, let's analyze the relevant information to determine the dominant word order.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example: ""ne’k‘di o’k‘ik"" (WHO-GAVE IT? [=TO WHOM DID HE GIVE IT?])
   - Example: ""ne’k‘di o’k‘tgwak‘"" (WHO GAVE IT TO HIM)
   - Analysis: These examples show the verb ""give"" (o’k‘ik/o’k‘tgwak‘) following the subject ""who"" (ne’k‘di) and the object ""it"" (o’k‘ik). This suggests an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example: ""dénadagwa hadele'p‘t"" (HIS-OWN (-dagwa) -EAR HE-PIERCED-IT)
   - Analysis: This sentence shows the subject ""he"" (implied in the verb form), the object ""ear"" (hadele'p‘t), and the verb ""pierced"" (dénadagwa). This suggests an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""dik!olola’n t‘ga'*p'dagwan"" (he-was-dug-up their-own-horns)
   - Example: ""et salklomo’klimin pliyin xebe''n"" (canoe it-was-kicked-to-pieces deer they-did-so)
   - Analysis: These examples are passive constructions and do not directly inform about the active declarative sentence structure.

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example: ""dak‘-limim-"" (TREE FALLS ON TOP OF)
   - Analysis: This example is intransitive and does not provide information about the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive sentences.

5. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example: ""ne’k‘di is expressed vy thhist! tlaya‘k’, but THE ANTS FOUND HIM by tlibis't' tlayak‘wa""
   - Analysis: This example shows the subject ""the ants"" (tlibis't'), the verb ""found"" (tlayak‘wa), and the object ""him"" (implied in the verb form). This suggests an SVO order.

### Reasoning:
The examples provided in Paragraphs 2, 3, and 17 give us insight into the word order of Takelma. Paragraph 2 and 17 suggest an SVO order, while Paragraph 3 suggests an SOV order. Given the limited data, it is challenging to definitively conclude a single dominant order. However, the presence of SVO examples in multiple paragraphs suggests that SVO might be more prevalent.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order

The evidence points to multiple possible orders, with SVO and SOV both appearing. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Takelma does not have a single dominant word order based on the provided data.",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Jemez,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of sentences with clear subject, object, and verb structures:
   - ""I saw several (different) things."" (something-p1 tr[1sg:3bas]-see/pf)
   - ""I went to some (different) places."" (somewhere-p1 intr[1sg]-go/pf)
   - ""Didn't you see anybody?"" (Lit. 'Did you see nobody?') (anyone-neg Q tr[2sg:3bas]-see/pf)
   - ""Didn't you go anywhere?"" (Lit. 'Did you go nowhere?') (anywhere-neg Q intr[2sg]-go/pf)
   - ""I was attacked by someone."" (someone-agt intr[1sg]-attack/psv.pf)

   These examples show that the verb typically follows the subject and object, indicating an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 8** provides further examples:
   - ""I punched that man."" (that man tr[1sg:3bas]-punch/pf)
   - ""I was punched by that man."" (that man-agt intr[1sg]-punch/psv.pf)

   Again, the verb follows the subject and object, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 13** includes:
   - ""A man killed a chicken."" (man chicken tr[3sg:3bas]-kill/pf)
   - ""I saw you (sg)."" (I a[1sg:2sg]-see/pf)
   - ""I made him angry."" (I tr[1sg:3bas]-make.angry/pf)

   These examples also demonstrate the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 17** provides:
   - ""I saw something."" (I Mod something tr[1sg:3bas]-see/pf)
   - ""He went somewhere."" (that he Mod somewhere intr[3bas]-go/pf)

   These examples are consistent with the SOV order.

The consistent pattern across these examples is that the subject precedes the object, which in turn precedes the verb, indicating that the dominant word order in Jemez is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Zuni,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that focus movement restores SOV order and that OSV word order results from focus movement in basic SOV clauses. This suggests that the basic or underlying order is SOV.
   
2. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that Zuni word order is ""strict SOV"" and that the verb must appear finally in its clause. This is a strong indication that SOV is the dominant word order.
   
3. **Paragraph 6** contrasts OSV order found with pronominal objects to the SOV order found with lexical NP arguments. This further supports that SOV is the basic order when both subject and object are nouns.
   
4. **Paragraph 7** mentions that OSV order is unmarked in certain cases, but this is in the context of pronominal objects, not lexical NPs.
   
5. **Paragraph 8** reiterates that the verb occurs finally and strictly so, reinforcing the SOV order.
   
6. **Paragraph 16** describes the order of arguments in question word constructions as subject - indirect object - direct object, which aligns with an SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Rama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Rama can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Rama is an SOV language and that the word order is relatively rigid.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that Rama is an SOV language, similar to Miskitu and Sumu.
3. **Paragraph 4** discusses the relative order of clitics and mentions the SOV word order of the language.
4. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that the basic word order of Rama is SOV.
5. **Paragraph 8** provides an example of an SOV sentence structure.
6. **Paragraph 20** confirms that Rama has a strict SOV word order, particularly in constructions involving a relational preverb and an overt NP.

These paragraphs consistently indicate that the dominant word order in Rama is SOV. The examples and descriptions provided reinforce this conclusion, showing that the subject precedes the object, which in turn precedes the verb.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tonkawa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tonkawa, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject, object and verb."" This directly indicates that the dominant word order is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

2. **Paragraph 2** provides an example sentence: ""'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o' The bad dog severely bit a big man."" This example follows the SOV order, with 'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la' (the bad dog) as the subject, 'ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak' (a big man) as the object, and 'nadj-o'' (bit) as the verb.

3. **Paragraph 11** also supports this order by stating: ""This sentence illustrates the usual word order in Tonkawa: subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal verb."" This reinforces the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 19** provides additional examples that follow the SOV order, such as: ""gwa'n-wa'-'a'la ha'na-d t'caw'al-'a'y'ik xe'ilaba-k-la yag'eklakno'o that woman going off and standing a distance away, he shot her, it is said."" Here, 'gwa'n-wa'-'a'la' (that woman) is the subject, 'xe'ilaba-k-la' (a distance away) is the object, and 'yag'eklakno'o' (he shot her) is the verb.

These examples and explicit statements from the grammar clearly indicate that the dominant word order in Tonkawa is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the independent subject tends to precede all other syntactic elements in the clause except the sentence connective. This suggests a tendency for the subject to come first.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples where the independent subject precedes the predicative word (verb), and the independent object follows the subject but precedes the predicative word. For example, ""ta’rustaéku, to’mahkak ?uwe’niwthé"" translates to ""when Rabbit found the alligator,"" indicating an SOV structure.
3. **Paragraph 13** further supports this by showing examples where the independent object is placed just before the predicative word, and the independent subject precedes both. This aligns with an SOV order.
4. **Paragraph 19** provides examples of simple sentences where the subject precedes the verb, and the object, if present, precedes the verb as well. For instance, ""to'kate’kahdku, ttya'nako'nt"" translates to ""The orphan boy spoke to her,"" which is consistent with SOV order.

The recurring pattern across these examples indicates that the dominant word order in Tunica is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Wappo.

1. **Paragraph 3** (§111. Position of Words in Sentence):
   - ""The verb is always last except that occasionally nouns in the instrumental case follow it.""
   - Examples provided:
     - ""pa't.a hu't'asi lelho'tsu mai'opo'nta, then coyote locked himself up in the hole of a rock.""
     - ""pa't*a hu't'asi k'a'pe ha'ota, then coyote picked up the feathers.""
     - ""tse'pi k-a'naci po'le ne'eke, he the Indian had a boy.""
     - ""o'na eole'kuma make'kdta me'yu, again he threw the fish-line in the water.""
     - ""tseka'li me'yu menata'ake, thus he got in the water.""
     - ""ma"" a mewi'eski te""ti, still he held on with the string.""
     - ""pa't-a me-'i tehotse'ta husa""oki, then the water was up to his neck.""

   These examples consistently show the verb appearing at the end of the sentence, indicating an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.

2. **Paragraph 4** (§113. Personal Pronouns):
   - ""They practically always appear before the verb, the pronominal subject preceding the object.""
   - Examples provided:
     - ""tco'el' a ya'omi, I'm almost dead.""
     - ""tcose""a ac*a, I'm sick, grandfather.""
     - ""ika'lica, it hurts me.""
     - ""i'hu te'metsela'li haci""a, fall on my head, I should say.""

   This paragraph supports the observation that the verb tends to appear at the end of the sentence, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 5** (§23. Syntactic Relations):
   - ""Position plays a relatively small place in Wappo, most of the syntactical relations being expressed by suffixes, prefixes, and particles (post-positions).""
   - Despite the flexibility mentioned, the examples provided in other paragraphs consistently show the verb at the end, indicating a preference for SOV order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov

Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, here is the analysis of the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1** indicates that Yurok word order is flexible and can vary depending on emphasis and context rather than strict syntactic rules. This suggests that there may not be a single dominant word order.

2. **Paragraph 4** mentions that it is uncommon for a sentence to have more than one noun and that nouns can appear either before or after the verb. It also states that no more than one noun will be positioned before the verb, and any additional nouns will be positioned after the verb. This implies variability in noun positioning relative to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 5** provide examples of adverb positioning and definitions of grammatical terms but do not directly address the dominant word order of subject, object, and verb.

4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 12** discuss verb transitivity and verb classes but do not provide specific information about the dominant word order.

5. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 13** provide examples of sentences with bipersonal verbs and object pronouns, showing that verbs can appear before or after subjects and objects, further indicating flexibility.

6. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss noun usage and verb formation but do not provide conclusive evidence about a dominant word order.

Given the information from the paragraphs, it is clear that Yurok exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, with no strict adherence to a single dominant pattern. The positioning of nouns and verbs can vary based on emphasis, context, and discourse considerations.

**Reasoning:**
The descriptive grammar emphasizes the flexibility of word order in Yurok and provides examples that show variability in the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs. There is no clear indication of a single dominant word order pattern in the provided text.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Nuuchahnulth,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (180) c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees the baby.""
   - Example (180) d: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees him/her/it.""
   - Example (180) e: ""c@brFh w`cF`ji<?hp"" translates to ""He/she/it sees the woman.""

   These examples show a structure where the verb (V) comes first, followed by the subject (S) and then the object (O) in some cases, and in other cases, the object (O) comes before the subject (S).

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (182) a: ""j`QGr@O`Q KTbrl@j QTwVhChs"" translates to ""Woodpecker’s wife brought out her salmonberry dish.""
   - Example (182) b: ""rTF`Q F`Cl` F`C`l`bhbHpG`mhl"" translates to ""Speak-Ends (man’s name) held a block.""
   - Example (182) c: ""B`wRhF`QQ@ XTpi@ Ji`krhb"" translates to ""Kwalisits too speared the whale.""

   These examples also show the verb (V) coming first, followed by the subject (S) and then the object (O).

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (185) a: ""F`bj`S`WrF`Qv@c PiDsh E`o`Bhp"" translates to ""Qweti jumped into the canoe.""
   - Example (185) b: ""FTRWTWoHc vdFhCo`Q C`aDFhKrhr"" translates to ""Someone slept in my bed.""
   - Example (185) c: ""BhsjohF`Q FhmjFH"" translates to ""He lay down on his back by the fire in the house.""

   These examples again show the verb (V) coming first, followed by the subject (S) and then the object (O).

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (167): ""c@brF`QrHbtW"" translates to ""I see you.""
   - Example (168): ""cTvhpr@jrHbtW"" translates to ""You are my father.""

   These examples are consistent with the verb (V) coming first, followed by the subject (S) and then the object (O).

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Example (276): ""p`FTbC`Ql` g`FtlFh"" translates to ""The food is in a pack-basket.""
   - Example (277): ""p`FTbB`Ql` mHr@jFh"" translates to ""There is a pack-basket in the sack.""

   These examples also follow the pattern where the verb (V) comes first, followed by the subject (S) and then the object (O).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nuuchahnulth appears to be **VSO (Verb-Subject-Object)**.

**Conclusion: VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin) can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive sentences and the unmarked VOS for transitive clauses, with some freedom of word order as VSO constructions are also possible.
2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the basic transitive word order is VOS, although there is some flexibility, and provides examples to illustrate this.
3. **Paragraph 4** confirms that the unmarked word order for transitive clauses is VOS.
4. **Paragraph 6** again states that VOS appears to be the unmarked order in the language, despite some freedom of word order.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while there is some flexibility in word order, the unmarked or dominant word order for transitive clauses in Columbia-Wenatchi is VOS.

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple paragraphs explicitly state that the unmarked or basic word order for transitive clauses is VOS.
- Examples provided in the text illustrate this VOS order.
- Although there is some flexibility and other orders like VSO are possible, the consistent mention of VOS as the unmarked order indicates its dominance.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Hidatsa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hidatsa, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 4** explicitly mentions that ""The unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons."" This indicates that the basic or dominant word order in Hidatsa is AOV, which corresponds to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) in the context of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

- **Paragraph 5** supports this by discussing the agentivity scale and how the A-argument (agent) is disambiguated, but it also mentions that ""The order of outside arguments in a transitive clause is not important since the A-argument is always disambiguated by its higher ranking on the agentivity scale relative to the O-argument."" This implies that while the order can be flexible, there is a default or unmarked order which is AOV.

- **Paragraph 19** further confirms the ergative-absolutive alignment in Hidatsa, where the A-argument (agent) of a transitive verb can be marked with an ergative case, while the S-argument (subject) of an intransitive verb and the O-argument (object) of a transitive verb are left unmarked. This aligns with the SOV order where the subject typically precedes the object and the verb.

- **Paragraph 18** discusses the split-intransitive alignment and the marking of arguments, which indirectly supports the SOV order by explaining the pronominal systems and their alignment with the verb.

Given these points, the dominant word order in Hidatsa is SOV.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Toqabaqita, we can analyze the dominant word order in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the structure of verb phrases and mentions that lexical direct objects come after all postverbal particles and are outside the verb complex. This suggests that the verb precedes the object.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Explicitly states that ""In verbal clauses the basic order is SVX and AVOX, where S represents an intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, O a direct object, and V a verb."" This indicates that the subject comes before the verb, and the verb comes before the object, supporting an SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb precedes the object, such as ""Kera thaitoqoma-na wela nau"" (They know my child and me), where ""thaitoqoma-na"" (know) is the verb and ""wela nau"" (my child and me) is the object.

4. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses topicalization and provides examples where the subject precedes the verb, and the verb precedes the object, such as ""Nau, lio-ku dora qana thata-na wane qeri"" (I have forgotten the man’s name), where ""lio-ku"" (my mind) is the subject, ""dora"" (forget) is the verb, and ""qana thata-na wane qeri"" (the man’s name) is the object.

5. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions that in object-incorporating compounds, the order is [noun verb], but this is a specific construction and does not contradict the general SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 11**: Provides examples of interrogative sentences where the verb precedes the object, such as ""Wela taa n=e ngali-a fanga qeri fasi-a?"" (Which child did he take the food from?), where ""ngali-a"" (take) is the verb and ""fanga qeri"" (the food) is the object.

7. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the focus construction and provides examples where the subject precedes the verb, and the verb precedes the object, such as ""Ni qoe n=o faqa-aqana-a qila qeri"" (It was you who lost the knife), where ""qoe"" (you) is the subject, ""faqa-aqana-a"" (lost) is the verb, and ""qila qeri"" (the knife) is the object.

From these points, it is clear that the dominant word order in Toqabaqita is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can deduce the dominant word order in Manambu by examining the typical structure of declarative sentences, especially those involving both subject (S) and object (O) participants as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that ""constituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb final in main clauses, and almost exclusively so in dependent clauses.""
   - The example 20.68a shows an AOV order: ""wun m@n-a:m vi ma:"" (I you.masc-lk+acc/loc hit+neg neg) translated as ""I will not hit you.""
   - Another example, 20.68b, shows an OAV order: ""ma: m@n-a:m wun vi"" (you.masc-lk+acc/loc I hit+neg neg) translated as ""I will not hit you"" (implying that I may hit someone else).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It provides further examples of constituent order, including AOV and OAV orders, but emphasizes that the verb tends to be final.
   - Example 20.75b shows a VOA order: ""ma: n@bay v@ l@-k@-m ñ@n"" (neg yet see+neg she-obl-acc/loc you.fem) translated as ""You (not anyone else: surprise) haven’t yet seen (guess who) her.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Discusses the order within noun phrases but does not directly address the order of S, O, and V in clauses.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Mentions that the general principle of ordering words and constituents in Manambu involves placing new and less topically established participants first, which can affect the order but does not change the verb-final tendency.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Discusses the structure of noun phrases and their modifiers, not directly relevant to S, O, V order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Provides examples of verbless clauses and their structure, which are not directly relevant to determining the dominant order of S, O, and V in verbal clauses.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Summarizes the properties of clause types and mentions that constituent order is not necessarily fixed in main clauses but is almost always fixed in dependent clauses, with a verb-final tendency.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Compares copula clauses, verbless clauses, and clauses with non-verbal predicates, emphasizing a subject-predicate order in non-verbal clauses.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Discusses the structure of complex predicates and the order of components within them, reinforcing the verb-final tendency.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Discusses grammatical relations and cross-referencing, mentioning that the subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced and that the order can vary based on topicality.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Mentions that complex predicates consist of two independent grammatical and phonological words, with the order of components being fixed.

12. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Provides examples of relative clauses and verb-noun compounds, emphasizing the fixed order of components within compounds.

13. **Paragraph 13**:
    - Discusses the limits of noun phrases and the order of modifiers, not directly relevant to S, O, V order.

    - Lists charts, schemes, and tables, not directly relevant to S, O, V order.

19. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Discusses speech reports and the transitivity of the verb ""say,"" not directly relevant to S, O, V order.

20. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Discusses the choice between different copula verbs, not directly relevant to S, O, V order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Manambu is **AOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by the frequent mention of verb-final tendencies and the examples provided, which predominantly show the AOV order in declarative sentences.

**Conclusion: AOV**",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Momu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Momu, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the typical ordering of participants relative to the predicate in a clause. It mentions that all participants occur before the final predicate, indicating a verb-final structure. Specifically, it states that the subject precedes the object(s), which in turn precede oblique(s) and adjunct(s), all of which precede the predicate. This suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V or simply verb-final. It also mentions that all participants in a clause typically occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering, reinforcing the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the subject is the first argument in the clause, followed by the object, and then the verb. This further supports the SOV word order.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of objects in ditransitive verbs, noting that both objects occur after the subject. This is consistent with an SOV structure, where the subject precedes both objects and the verb.

5. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides examples of bivalent clauses with transitive predicates, showing the subject, followed by the oblique-marked object, and then the verb. This again supports the SOV word order.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of elements in clauses, mentioning that subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs and that objects are less so. It also states that predicates can be verbal or non-verbal, with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms. The examples provided show the subject preceding the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples of nominals functioning as arguments to a predicate, showing the subject preceding the object and the verb, which is consistent with SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the comitative marker on nominals and its functions, including coordinating subject NPs and marking instrumental obliques. It mentions that non-subject arguments can be inflected for oblique case and that noun phrases are head-initial, with the oblique case marker indicating non-subject arguments. The examples provided show the subject preceding the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the basic constituent order in Makasae is SOV. It provides examples of both intransitive and transitive sentences, showing the subject (S) preceding the object (O) and the verb (V). This paragraph also mentions that word order is the main device to indicate grammatical roles due to limited morphology.

2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces that non-canonical word orders are rare and that the overwhelming majority of clauses conform to the unmarked SOV word order.

3. **Paragraph 5** reiterates that the unmarked word order in the clause is SOV and discusses the role of the subject and non-subject arguments within this structure.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides an example of a relative clause where the constituent order conforms to the basic SOV word order.

5. **Paragraph 9** discusses the optional expression of subjects and objects in discourse but notes that in a sequence of an NP and a transitive verb, the NP preceding the verb is generally interpreted as the verb’s object, which aligns with the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 15** mentions that the majority of sentences in Makasae follow the unmarked SOV word order, even though arguments may be left-dislocated for pragmatic purposes.

7. **Paragraph 18** provides examples of verb phrases containing objects or complements, showing that the non-subject argument position is preverbal, consistent with an SOV order.

Given the consistent references to SOV as the basic and unmarked word order in multiple paragraphs, it is clear that SOV is the dominant word order in Makasae.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Motuna by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a table and examples of basic word order in transitive verbal clauses. It mentions different orders such as O(ABS)A(ERG)VP, A(ERG)O(ABS)VP, and A(ABS)O(ABS)VP. The choice between these orders depends on which argument is the topic. This indicates some flexibility in word order but does not conclusively determine a dominant order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the cross-referencing of person and number in NPs, allowing for the omission of NPs without confusion. It reiterates the basic word order and case markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses but does not specify a dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph categorizes arguments in verbal clauses and mentions that core arguments are obligatorily cross-referenced by pronominal markings on the verb. It provides examples of verb structures but does not specify a dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph lists various tables and diagrams related to syntactic structures but does not provide specific information on the dominant word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph repeats examples of verb structures and mentions that verbs may take core noun phrases (S, A, or O), which are obligatorily cross-referenced. It does not specify a dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph classifies word classes and mentions that Motuna is predominantly an agglutinative language with complex morphology. It does not provide specific information on the dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the order of adjectives and participles within noun phrases but does not provide information on the dominant word order of clauses.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides examples of verb morphology and cross-referencing but does not specify a dominant word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions that the order of NP constituents and verbs is unmarked and can vary due to discourse factors. It lists SV, OAV, and AOV as commonly found constituent orders, suggesting some flexibility but not a clear dominant order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses case markings and the absence of prepositions or postpositions in Motuna. It mentions that word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors, with given information typically occupying the first position and the verb the last position. This suggests a tendency towards SOV order but does not conclusively establish it as dominant.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the structure of noun phrases and the order of attributes but does not provide information on the dominant word order of clauses.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the paradigms of verbs and cross-referencing markings but does not specify a dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, there is no conclusive evidence to establish a single dominant word order for Motuna. The language exhibits flexibility in word order, influenced by syntactic and pragmatic factors.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph explicitly states that ""Core NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object. There is thus a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV.""
   - This is further supported by examples and explanations within the paragraph, such as ""the sea eagle and the woman built a house first,"" where the subject (sea eagle and the woman) precedes the object (house) and the verb (built) comes last.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the syntactic functions and grammatical relations in Lavukaleve, reinforcing the SOV structure by explaining how subjects and objects are treated in transitive sentences.
   - Examples provided, such as ""the man died"" (subject-verb) and ""she gave it (the food) to her husband"" (subject-object-verb), align with the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph provides an overview of word classes and mentions that constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV, which translates to SOV in terms of basic word order.
   - The discussion of focus markers and their placement also indirectly supports the SOV structure by showing how elements are ordered in sentences.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph discusses complex predicates and serial verb constructions, indicating that even in complex sentences, the basic SOV order is maintained.
   - Examples such as ""they were still playing and she went up and appeared [to them]"" show the subject preceding the verb, consistent with SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph further elaborates on the structure of clauses, including the use of focus markers and the agreement system, which all operate within the SOV framework.
   - Examples provided, such as ""I will see tree roots"" (subject-verb-object), reinforce the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph discusses subordinate clauses and their participant marking, again within the context of an SOV structure.
   - Examples like ""he will respect a promise he made to us"" (subject-object-verb) support the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph discusses focus constructions and provides examples where the subject precedes the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.
   - Examples such as ""I want bananas"" (subject-object-verb) and ""I want money"" (subject-object-verb) align with the SOV structure.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - This paragraph discusses the Agreement Suffix and its use in various constructions, all within an SOV framework.
   - Examples like ""the giants came back"" (subject-verb) and ""the sun went up"" (subject-verb) support the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Lavukaleve is SOV, as consistently indicated by the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar.",sov,sov
Dla (Menggwa),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dla (Menggwa), we can determine the dominant word order of the language by examining the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of clauses with verbs preceded by one or more (pro)nominals. It states that when there are (pro)nominals in a clause, the verb is placed after all the (pro)nominals. It also mentions that the relative order of subject and object nominals can be interchanged freely without changing the pragmatic status and semantics. This suggests a flexible word order but with a tendency towards verb-final structure.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph explicitly states that most clauses are verb-final, and the order among the free constituents (noun phrases and other words) before the verb is free. This reinforces the idea that the verb typically comes at the end of the clause.

3. **Paragraph 7**: Similar to Paragraph 6, it mentions that clauses are most usually verb-final, and the order of the constituents in front of the clause is free. This further supports the verb-final tendency.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph reiterates that clauses are predominantly verb-final, and phrases in front of the verb can be scrambled to any order. This consistent mention of verb-final structure across multiple paragraphs indicates a strong tendency towards SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides examples where the object precedes the subject, but it also states that the order of the object and subject nominals can be interchanged freely. This flexibility in the order of subject and object, combined with the verb-final tendency, suggests that while the language allows for some variation, the dominant order is likely SOV.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Dla (Menggwa) is SOV, as indicated by the consistent verb-final structure mentioned across multiple paragraphs, despite the flexibility in the order of subject and object nominals.",no dominant order,sov
Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can infer the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Subject argument NPs are clause-initial. Object NPs typically follow subject NPs.""
   - The typical ordering is represented as: (NPsubject) Verb (NPobject).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the identification of subjects and objects but does not provide explicit word order information.

3. **Paragraph 4**:

Taiap,"### Reasoning:

To determine the dominant word order in Taiap, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any explicit or implicit information about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV). This suggests that the usual word order in Taiap is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of sentences:
   - (4-19a) ""Sopak wokara"" translates to ""Sopak has gone,"" where ""Sopak"" is the subject and ""wokara"" is the verb, indicating an SV order.
   - (4-19b) ""Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun"" translates to ""Sopak chopped firewood,"" where ""Sopakyi"" (Sopak) is the subject, ""taruŋg"" (firewood) is the object, and ""kratukun"" (chopped) is the verb, indicating an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 9** provides examples of transitive verbs:
   - (5-1a) ""poŋgro"" translates to ""they hit him,"" where ""po"" is the verb stem, ""ŋg"" is the object suffix, and ""ro"" is the subject suffix, indicating an SOV order.
   - (5-1b) ""oŋgrɨndak"" translates to ""they will hit him,"" where ""o"" is the verb stem, ""ŋgrɨ"" is the object suffix, and ""ndak"" is the subject suffix, again indicating an SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of intransitive and transitive verbs:
   - (3-28) ""ŋgu pirok"" translates to ""she laughed,"" where ""ŋgu"" is the subject and ""pirok"" is the verb, indicating an SV order.
   - (3-29) ""ŋayi yu tanun"" translates to ""I saw you,"" where ""ŋayi"" is the subject, ""yu"" is the object, and ""tanun"" is the verb, indicating an SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of object and subject suffixes:
   - (5-6a) ""ewar ŋgɨgi ŋɨ poŋgro"" translates to ""yesterday they hit him,"" where ""ewar"" is a temporal adverb, ""ŋgɨgi"" is the subject, ""ŋɨ"" is the object, and ""poŋgro"" is the verb, indicating an SOV order.
   - (5-6b) ""epi ŋgɨgi ŋɨ oŋgrɨndak"" translates to ""tomorrow they will hit him,"" where ""epi"" is a temporal adverb, ""ŋgɨgi"" is the subject, ""ŋɨ"" is the object, and ""oŋgrɨndak"" is the verb, again indicating an SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Taiap is **SOV**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Yimas,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can analyze the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that the heads of constructions always occur to their right.
   - The only obligatory constituent of a clause is the verb, and the rightmost obligatory constituent of a verb is the tense morpheme.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Yimas clauses have very little structure and are non-configurational, meaning word order is free.
   - Examples (6-184) show various word orders (SOV, SVO, VSO, etc.) with no obligatory order.
   - Example (6-186) shows different orders (SOV, SVO, OSV, etc.) and indicates that SOV might be considered unmarked in elicitation but not necessarily in actual discourse.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The word order in sentences is flexible, and the meaning is carried by verbal prefixes rather than word order.
   - Example (5-2) shows ambiguity in word order due to identical verbal prefixes for different noun classes.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - The order of object and subject prefixes on verbs is determined by a person hierarchy and role hierarchy, not by fixed word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Both object and subject can appear as suffixes in the order object/subject.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Elevational/directional prefixes can appear inside serial verb constructions, indicating flexibility in word order.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Clausal constituents are generally words, and there are no hierarchical structure or ordering constraints among the constituents.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Word order is quite free in most Lower Sepik languages, including Yimas.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - The linear order of prefixes on transitive verbs is determined by a person hierarchy and role hierarchy.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Prefix forms in Yimas do not code syntactic functions directly but rather linear order.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - The verb is the most morphologically complex word class, and pronominal affixes serve as the primary device signaling grammatical relations.

12. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Examples show different word orders (SOV, SVO, etc.), indicating flexibility.

13. **Paragraph 13**:
    - There is no significant meaning difference between different orders of nominals inside the complement.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Yimas is described as polysynthetic, with complex verb forms that correspond to entire sentences in English.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Verb serialization and incorporation indicate that verbs can carry multiple arguments and adjuncts within a single word.

16. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Stress patterns and phonological rules indicate that verbs are complex units, further supporting the idea of flexible word order.

17. **Paragraph 17**:
    - Examples of verb serialization show that verbs can incorporate multiple elements, indicating flexibility in constituent order.

18. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Elevational/directional prefixes and incorporated adverbials show that verbs can have complex internal structures, supporting flexible word order.

19. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Verb compounding and serialization demonstrate that verbs can form complex units with multiple arguments, indicating flexible word order.

20. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Pronouns and deictics show that Yimas has a rich system of pronominal forms, further supporting the idea of flexible word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Yimas exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, with no single dominant order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences. The language is non-configurational, and the grammatical relations are primarily indicated by verbal morphology rather than word order.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order

Maybrat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, we can determine the dominant word order of the language by examining the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (34a): ""t-kom am re-f-o m-kah t-atia y-sia t-me""
     - Translation: ""I wrote this book for my father and mother.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""I"", Verb: ""wrote"", Object: ""this book"")

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (37): ""rae y-amo""
     - Translation: ""The man goes.""
     - Structure: SV (Subject: ""The man"", Verb: ""goes"")
   - Example (33): ""rae m-siar m-me ania""
     - Translation: ""Many people fight with each other.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""Many people"", Verb: ""fight"", Object: ""each other"")

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (68): ""t-ehoh fane""
     - Translation: ""I stab the pig.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""I"", Verb: ""stab"", Object: ""the pig"")

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example (3): ""rae y-amo y-kit aof""
     - Translation: ""The man goes towards the sago tree.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""The man"", Verb: ""goes"", Object: ""towards the sago tree"")

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example (11): ""rae m-fat ara""
     - Translation: ""The people fell a tree.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""The people"", Verb: ""fell"", Object: ""a tree"")

6. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example (23): ""m-e u na m-akuos ru r-ana m-nan m-tah Ø""
     - Translation: ""They returned again and then they roasted their bird and after that they ate (it).""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject: ""They"", Verb: ""roasted"", Object: ""their bird"")

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit information about the dominant word order (SOV, SVO, VOS, VSO, OVS, OSV) in Asmat. The paragraphs primarily discuss morphological aspects, such as suffixes indicating subjects and objects, and the structure of verbs, but they do not provide clear examples or descriptions of the syntactic order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraphs 1-3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20**: These paragraphs focus on the morphological structure of verbs, suffixes for subjects and objects, and other morphological processes. They do not provide information on the syntactic order of constituents in declarative sentences.
2. **Paragraphs 4, 6-8, 11-14, 17**: These paragraphs discuss various other linguistic features, such as the use of affixes, negations, and specific markers, but do not address the word order in declarative sentences.

Given the lack of relevant information on the syntactic order of subject, object, and verb, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order from the provided text.

### Conclusion:
Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Kuot,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structure and the positioning of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph mentions that Kuot is a ""predicate-initial language"" and is possibly unique among non-Austronesian languages in this respect.
   - It also states that Kuot matches all the major features of a harmonic VSO language according to Greenberg’s word order universals.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of topicalization and the basic structure of clauses.
   - Example (23) shows the structure: ""o-ikat=oŋ Adam [muabari aŋ]"" which translates to ""Adam checked his watch."" Here, ""o-ikat=oŋ"" (checked) is the verb, ""Adam"" is the subject, and ""muabari aŋ"" (his watch) is the object, indicating a VSO order.
   - Example (24) also follows the VSO order: ""nǝmo o-u-uluan i-tie non kuraima nirobu"" which translates to ""this bush spirit wanted to follow the coconut palm (up).""

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph reiterates that the unmarked constituent order in Kuot is predicate-initial with optional noun phrases for core arguments: V (S) (O).

From these observations, it is clear that Kuot predominantly follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) order in its declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
VSO",vso,vso
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Imonda can be determined by examining the syntactic structure and the placement of the verb in relation to the subject and object in declarative sentences. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses various aspects of the clause, including word order. It states that the verb must occur in the final position, indicating that the verb is placed at the end of the sentence. This suggests that the language has a verb-final structure.

3. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph reiterates that the verb occurs in the final position within the clause. It provides examples showing the flexibility of the order of other constituents (subject, object, adverbials) but consistently places the verb at the end.

4. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses predicate structure and the distinction between core and peripheral NPs. It does not provide explicit examples of word order but supports the verb-final structure by discussing the syntactic relations within the clause.

5. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph provides examples of transitive verbs and their objects. The examples show the verb occurring at the end of the sentence, reinforcing the verb-final structure.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with nominalized verbs and clausal objects. The verb is consistently placed at the end of the sentence.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Imonda has a verb-final structure, where the verb consistently occurs at the end of the sentence. The dominant word order in Imonda is therefore **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit information about the dominant word order (order of subject, object, and verb) in Nimboran. The paragraphs primarily focus on morphological categories, verb forms, and other grammatical features without directly addressing the syntactic structure of declarative sentences involving both subject and object nouns.

1. **Reasoning**: The paragraphs given do not provide any direct examples or descriptions of sentence structures that include both subject and object nouns in declarative sentences. The focus is on verb morphology, pronoun systems, and other grammatical categories rather than on the syntactic arrangement of subjects, objects, and verbs.

2. **Conclusion**: Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, several key pieces of information point to the dominant word order in Kwomtari:

1. **Paragraph 5** states explicitly: ""Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS."" This directly indicates that the dominant word order in declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 12** reinforces this by stating: ""Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and constituent order is SOV."" This further supports the SOV structure as the dominant word order.

3. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences that align with the SOV order:
   - Example (102): ""Mena krie-i penki motuke pukete-ne-i tetu mareteku kotue tu-po-fwa-ne-ke luku-le-ne-ke fo-po-bile."" Here, the structure follows the SOV pattern where the subject (Mena), object (penki motuke), and verb (pukete-ne-i) are in the SOV order.
   - Example (104): ""Nali feta-lee-lu yesou-le pilu-le-fo-lee."" Again, the structure follows the SOV pattern with the subject (Nali), object (yesou-le), and verb (pilu-le-fo-lee).

4. **Paragraph 7** provides additional examples:
   - Example (24): ""Lufwa are ite-i la-la-ne."" This sentence follows the SOV order with the subject (Lufwa), object (ite-i), and verb (la-la-ne).
   - Example (25): ""Lulua-lu-ke lai-la-ne-i gugu pue-po-fwa-le."" This also follows the SOV order with the subject (Lulua-lu-ke), object (gugu), and verb (pue-po-fwa-le).

### Conclusion:

Inanwatan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can analyze the word order in transitive clauses, which is crucial for determining the dominant word order in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that transitive clauses can have either SOV or SVO order.
2. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of transitive clauses:
   - Example (4.9): ""Ni-a-weigo-re"" (I SG.S-2SG.O-deceive-PAST) translates to ""I deceived you,"" which follows the SOV order.
   - Example (4.10): ""Aoutourame-rf-we-be"" (their fish DEM 3.S- I PL.EX.o-give-PRES) translates to ""They gave us their fish,"" which follows the SVO order.
   - Example (4.11): ""Nf-taturi-dereni-tato-ereour-grandfather-and our-grandmother-and aq[romaqare foreleg hindleg mog6-we-rawe-re"" translates to ""My grandfather and grandmother carried up the foreleg and the hindleg,"" which follows the SOV order.
   - Example (4.12): ""Ag6-waie-ra-qame-rabu-ego-imeduro ewai"" translates to ""And he had hidden her wings,"" which follows the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 15** discusses the influence of Malay on Inanwatan, noting that SVO order occurs in frequent variation with SOV order in Inanwatan clauses. This suggests that both orders are used, likely due to language contact.

4. **Paragraph 3** also states that objects frequently occur after the verb, indicating a tendency towards SVO order.

Given the evidence, it is clear that both SOV and SVO orders are used in Inanwatan. The grammar does not indicate a strong preference for one over the other, suggesting that the language does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, it exhibits flexibility, likely influenced by contact with Malay.

Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the most standard word order in Sentani is SOV. It mentions that while the verb is typically inflected for person and number as well as mood, this is not strictly necessary. The assignment of syntactic roles is based on context, pronominal case marking on the verb, and constituent ordering.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates that the most unmarked word order is SOV. It also mentions that word order in Sentani is quite free, with all non-verbal constituents having some maneuverability depending on information structure. However, the verb itself cannot move.

3. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph confirms that the unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved depending on information structural processes.

4. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides a summary of the grammar sketch and mentions that the noun phrase is head-initial, but it does not contradict the previously stated SOV order for clauses.

5. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides an example sentence with the SOV order: ""bele jo na to mbajrə əke əwnəhikæwnuke,"" which translates to ""One man from the village came and ordered him.""

6. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph provides another example sentence with the SOV order: ""Jahimo paj Jakali janewfoke jore əwole,"" which translates to ""The next day, Jakali ran away back to his village.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.""
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the word order within noun phrases but does not contradict the SVO order mentioned in Paragraph 1.
3. **Paragraph 5** mentions adverbs of mode occurring clause-finally, which aligns with an SVO structure where the verb and object precede the adverb.
4. **Paragraph 6** shows an example of a bound pronoun in object position following the verb, which is consistent with SVO order.
5. **Paragraph 9** provides an example of a verb followed by an object pronoun, again supporting the SVO structure.
6. **Paragraph 10** discusses transitive and intransitive verbs but does not provide information that contradicts the SVO order.
7. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 14** discuss verb sequences and verb serialization, which do not provide direct information about the basic SVO order but do not contradict it either.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 1 and the supporting examples in other paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Mpur is SVO.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It states that ""both subject and object normally precede the verb and only rarely does the object precede the subject.""
   - Example (14) shows the order: `nanda=r gana=r re eloko-m-r` (older.brother=M younger.brother=M 3SG.M.OBJ tell-PAST2-3SG.M), which translates to ""The big brother told the little brother.""
   - This indicates an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It mentions that ""the default order is for the verb to occur at the end of clauses.""
   - Example (5) shows: `yen=t ka rete=ka sukna-m-s` (child=DIM REAL put=REAL sleep-PAST2-3SG.F), translating to ""She put the child to sleep, the spirit did.""
   - This also supports an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - It provides a general structure: ""Clause = subject + (mood particle) + (direct object) + (indirect object) + verb.""
   - Example (2) shows: `afa=r ka mini=r te nuwa-m-r` (father=M REAL betelnut=M 3SG.F.OBJ give-PAST2-3SG.M), translating to ""[Her] father gave her betelnut.""
   - This further supports an SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - It explicitly states: ""The basic word order of Mehek sign language follows that of spoken Mehek, i.e. SOV.""

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (3) shows: `on ka rusu=ka a-ya-yun` (1SG REAL sit=REAL eat-PRES-1SG), translating to ""I am sitting and eating.""
   - This example is less clear for SOV but does not contradict it.

6. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example (26) shows: `on ka me eloko-wa-yun` (1SG REAL 3PL.OBJ tell-PAST1-1SG), translating to ""I told them.""
   - This supports an SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 18**:
   - It discusses passive clauses but mentions that in active clauses, the structure is A (subject) + P (object) + V (verb), which aligns with SOV.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that the dominant word order in Mehek is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Abui,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that Stokhof (1984) claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent fronting is mentioned. This is a direct reference to the word order in Abui, indicating that SOV is considered the basic or dominant order.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences and constructions in Abui. For instance, the sentence ""kawen ama mi bataa tukong"" translates to ""with machete one cuts wood,"" where ""kawen"" (machete) is fronted for focus. The underlying structure without focus fronting would be ""ama mi bataa tukong,"" which follows the SOV order (subject ""ama,"" object ""bataa,"" verb ""tukong"").

3. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph lists several sentences that follow the SOV order. For example, ""mokuloku de-bal ha-kul"" translates to ""the children are throwing the ball,"" where ""mokuloku"" (children) is the subject, ""de-bal"" (ball) is the object, and ""ha-kul"" (throw) is the verb, following the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the distributional properties of nouns and provides examples of noun phrases and their modifiers. While it does not directly address the word order of clauses, it supports the SOV structure by showing how noun phrases are constructed and positioned within sentences.

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses quantifiers and their position within noun phrases. It provides examples of noun phrases with quantifiers following the head noun, which aligns with the SOV structure where modifiers follow the head noun.

6. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph reiterates that modifiers follow the head noun in the order of attribution, quantification, and specification, supporting the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Arapesh (Abu) by focusing on the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 1:**
- This paragraph mentions ""subject-verb-object"" as the obligatory ordering in Abu, contrasting it with other Papuan languages that typically use A-U-V or S-O-V ordering.

**Paragraph 2:**
- It reinforces the strict S-V-O grammatical word order in Abu, especially in the absence of overt case marking morphemes.

**Paragraph 3:**
- This paragraph describes the structure of sentences in Abu, mentioning that the predicate follows the actor-subject phrase, which aligns with an SVO order.

**Paragraph 7:**
- Example sentence: ""kw-a-ha nubat"" (She hit/killed a dog). Here, ""kw-a-ha"" (hit/killed) is the verb, and ""nubat"" (dog) is the object, following the subject ""She"". This example demonstrates an SVO structure.

**Paragraph 12:**
- Example sentence: ""aleman ubahi-n-e-r-i n-a-ha bul kani walub"" (The big man killed a pig at the river). This sentence follows the SVO order: ""aleman"" (man) is the subject, ""n-a-ha"" (killed) is the verb, and ""bul"" (pig) is the object.

**Paragraph 16:**
- This paragraph mentions the interaction of nouns and verbs in different scenes, which indirectly supports the SVO structure by describing how actions (verbs) are performed by subjects on objects.

**Paragraph 17:**
- This paragraph mentions the occurrence of pronouns in subject, object, and other slots, but does not provide specific examples of word order.

**Paragraph 19:**
- This paragraph discusses the morphological composition of nouns but does not provide specific information on word order.

**Paragraph 20:**
- This paragraph describes imperative mood utterances, which are not relevant to determining the word order in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the dominant word order in Korafe by examining the syntactic structure and the order of constituents in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Although SOY represents the unmarked order of core constituents in transitive verbal clauses, other configurations (i.e. OSV, SVO, OVS, VSO, VOS) also occur."" This indicates that while other orders are possible due to pragmatic constraints, SOY is the default or unmarked order.

2. **Paragraph 4** reinforces this by stating, ""Information is structured in sentences by the order of arguments and by pragmatic markers. Although SOY is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause, OSY occurs when the object has pragmatic topic function and the subject pragmatic focus function."" This again points to SOY as the default order, with variations occurring due to pragmatic reasons.

3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that ""even though SVO/AOV is the default constituent order for Korafe verbal clauses,"" which might seem contradictory at first. However, this could be a typographical error or a misinterpretation in the text, as other paragraphs consistently point to SOY as the default.

4. **Paragraph 15** states, ""Sometimes this argument coincides with the subject, because the unmarked order of constituents in Korafe verbal clauses is SOY."" This further supports the conclusion that SOY is the unmarked or default order.

5. **Paragraph 19** discusses the topicalization of the object and the assignment of focus to the subject, resulting in OSY order. However, this is noted as a marked order used for specific pragmatic functions, not the default.

6. **Paragraph 20** mentions that ""Subject referents that are lower on the animacy hierarchy than object referents can still occur as unmarked agents when the default SOY order is maintained,"" reinforcing the idea that SOY is the default order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Korafe is **SOV**. This is consistently mentioned as the default or unmarked order, with other orders occurring due to pragmatic constraints.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in ordering.
2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces this by mentioning that the basic word order of a two-place clause is SOV, although it is flexible and the object may follow the predicate or precede the subject for pragmatic reasons.
3. **Paragraph 7** mentions that Alamblak exhibits most general morpho-syntactic tendencies typically associated with SOV languages.
4. **Paragraph 14** also states that most general morpho-syntactic tendencies typically associated with SOV languages are exhibited in Alamblak.

These paragraphs consistently indicate that the basic or dominant word order in Alamblak is SOV, despite some flexibility and pragmatic variations.

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple paragraphs explicitly state that the basic word order is SOV.
- The flexibility mentioned does not negate the dominance of the SOV order but rather indicates that variations can occur due to pragmatic reasons.
- The association with typical SOV morpho-syntactic tendencies further supports the conclusion.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
I'saka,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in I'saka by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states the basic order of elements in a declarative sentence: ""The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOY, with Oblique participants (including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the verb."" This directly indicates that the dominant word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Examples in Paragraph 3**:
   - ""Numupu di-0 ku wei."" translates to ""We were all sleeping in the house."" Here, ""Numupu"" (we) is the subject, ""ku"" (house) is the object, and ""di-0"" (sleep) is the verb, confirming the SOV order.
   - ""Wi to. wei tru."" translates to ""The water is inside the house."" Although this example is not a transitive sentence, it supports the structure where the verb follows the subject and object.

3. **Paragraph 1** mentions deviations from the word order for pragmatic reasons but reinforces that such deviations are rare and marked, suggesting a strong preference for a specific order.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the word order in interrogative clauses and focus positions, which differ from declarative clauses. However, this does not affect the determination of the dominant order in declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 8** mentions non-verbal predicates but aligns with the SOV structure by placing the predicative noun or adjective in the same final position as the verb in verbal clauses.

6. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of clause chaining, where the object noun phrase is omitted in the second clause if it is the same as in the first clause, reinforcing the SOV order in the initial clause.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Urim,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, the dominant word order in Urim can be determined as follows:

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph explicitly states that ""Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language."" It mentions that the position of the subject is very fixed and cannot be moved after the verb in most clause types. The object can be fronted for thematic reasons, but this does not change the basic SVO structure.
   - Examples provided in the paragraph also illustrate this SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph reinforces the rigidity of the word order in Urim, stating that subjects almost always occur before the verb, and objects can be fronted but this is rare.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - The examples given in this paragraph show the object being fronted, but the basic word order remains SVO.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph discusses semitransitive clauses, which also follow the SVO structure.

5. **Paragraph 8**:
   - While it mentions that placing the subject after the verb is rare and can occur in certain clause types, it does not contradict the dominant SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - This paragraph discusses intransitive clauses and provides examples where the subject always occurs before the verb, consistent with an SVO structure.

7. **Paragraph 15**:
   - The possessive clause examples provided also follow the SVO structure.

8. **Paragraph 20**:
   - This paragraph discusses various clause types and mentions that the subject referent is usually more animate and agent-like, which aligns with the SVO order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Urim is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structure and the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the positioning of constituents in a transitive clause and mentions that the object NP often immediately precedes the verb phrase, indicating an SOV structure. It also notes that the subject can precede the verb if given more prominence, but this is less common and often involves topicalization.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of SOV order and mentions that OSV order is used for topicalization, but this is marked and not the neutral order. The neutral order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Explicitly states that the default ordering of arguments in Abau is Subject Object Verb (SOV), though this order can vary for pragmatic reasons.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Reinforces that the neutral or frequently observed order places the subject before the object and the verb phrase clause-finally, which aligns with SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that the verbal clause follows SOV order by default and displays syntactic marking of subject and object.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses relative clauses and indicates that they follow SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 9**: States that normal order within Abau is SOV, but OSV can be used to change prominence, indicating that SOV is the unmarked, default order.

8. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions that the most common order within Abau is SOV, but it can be changed to OSV for prominence reasons.

9. **Paragraph 16**: Adopts a schema for Abau sentence structure that places S and O in neutral or unmarked positions, indicating SOV as the default order.

10. **Paragraph 20**: Provides examples of sentences with SOV order and mentions that the head of the noun phrase is marked by the same topic marker, reinforcing the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the consistent references to SOV as the neutral, default, or frequently observed order in multiple paragraphs, the dominant word order in Abau is clearly **SOV**.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, several key points about Chamorro word order can be discerned:

1. **Predicate-First Language**: Chamorro is described as a predicate-first language, meaning that the predicate (verb or adjective) typically comes before its arguments (subject and object). This is explicitly stated in Paragraph 9 and Paragraph 16.

2. **Dominant Word Order**: The dominant word order for clauses formed from verbs or adjectives is Predicate Subject Object (PSO), as mentioned in Paragraph 1, Paragraph 9, and Paragraph 10. This is reiterated in Paragraph 14, which provides a final version of the word order template.

3. **Flexibility and Preferences**: While the dominant order is Predicate Subject Object, there is flexibility in the word order. For example, the subject can appear after the object or at the right edge of the clause. However, in cases of potential ambiguity, the order Predicate Subject Object is strongly preferred or required, as noted in Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 11.

4. **Examples**: Several examples illustrate the PSO order:
   - Paragraph 2: ""Ha latchai i na’-ña i taotåo."" (Predicate Subject Object)
   - Paragraph 6: ""Ha dåggåo i bola guatu gi taotåo i patgun."" (Predicate Object Subject)
   - Paragraph 8: ""Ha dåggåo i patgun i bola guatu gi taotåo."" (Predicate Subject Object)

5. **Summary and Templates**: Paragraph 14 and Paragraph 7 provide word order templates that confirm the dominant order as Predicate Subject Object (PSO).

### Conclusion:
**VSO**

The dominant word order in Chamorro is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO).",vso,vso
Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

The dominant word order in Awtuw can be determined by analyzing the provided paragraphs for patterns in the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states: ""Awtuw's basic word order is readily identifiable as verb-final, indeed as SOV.""
2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of sentences in different orders, but the presence of multiple permutations does not negate the stated basic order.
3. **Paragraph 4** mentions that in reflexive clauses, the word order is rigidly S REFL (O) V, which supports the verb-final pattern.
4. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** provide examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with SOV order:
   - ""tey rame ( - re ) d u - p u y ' -a"" (she hit a man)
   - ""Yawur yen-e kow-re"" (Yawur will give you something)
5. **Paragraph 19** also supports the verb-final pattern with examples like:
   - ""rey reye rokra-kay"" (he has cooked food)
   - ""yaw-re da-k-law-ey"" (someone is baking a pig)

Despite the flexibility in word order mentioned in some paragraphs, the consistent pattern of verb-final sentences in declarative contexts with both subject and object nouns indicates that the dominant word order in Awtuw is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Mian,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses reflexivization and provides examples of transitive sentences. The example (78) shows the sentence ""The man has cut the skin"" with the structure:
   - Subject (S): naka=e (man=SG.M)
   - Object (O): aal=e (skin=SG.N1)
   - Verb (V): gò’-n-e=be (cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL)
   This indicates an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states the unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses as AOV (Agent-Object-Verb), which is another way of saying SOV. Example (91) illustrates this:
   - Subject (S): naka=e (man=SG.M)
   - Object (O): unáng=o (woman=SG.F)
   - Verb (V): wa-têm’-Ø-e=be (3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL)
   This confirms the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses argument order in ditransitive clauses and mentions that the unmarked constituent order is A R O V (Agent-Recipient-Object-Verb). This supports the verb-final (V) position, consistent with SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Reiterates that the unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses, reinforcing the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that constituent order in relative clauses is no different from independent clauses, further supporting the consistency of the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Chácobo as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that overtly-marked constructions allow SNV and predicate to variably order, with predicate-S order appearing to be the default. This suggests some flexibility but hints at a preference for predicate-initial structures.

2. **Paragraph 2** indicates that the {A,S} subject does not occur in a fixed order with respect to the V̄-constituent, but the {P,T,R} object precedes the V̄-constituent. This suggests that objects tend to come before verbs, indicating an SOV or OVS structure.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the alignment of constituent order, mentioning that in fronted-VP constructions, the object appears in a fronted position before the V̄-constituent. This again suggests a tendency for objects to precede verbs.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples where the object can occur after the clause-type morpheme, but this is marked by a pause, indicating it might be an afterthought. This suggests that the default order might not be object-final.

5. **Paragraph 5** shows examples where subjects appear in position 16, indicating a VS/A order in C-rigid clauses, but also mentions variability in C-flexible constructions.

6. **Paragraph 6** states that {A,S,P} arguments display a neutral alignment when they occur before a lexical verb or V̄-constituent, suggesting flexibility but with a tendency for pre-verbal positioning.

7. **Paragraph 7** discusses fronted-VP constructions where the object appears before the V̄-constituent, reinforcing the idea of pre-verbal objects.

8. **Paragraph 8** mentions that objects can occur in positions 2 and 7, and that the argument most topical is closer to the verb, indicating some flexibility but with a tendency for pre-verbal objects.

9. **Paragraph 9** provides examples of AVP and VAP orders, showing variability but with a preference for AVP in certain contexts.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses the role of clause-type/rank morphemes in determining subject positions, indicating flexibility but with a tendency for post-verbal subjects in C-rigid clauses.

11. **Paragraph 11** shows examples of APV and PAV orders, indicating variability but with a preference for pre-verbal objects in C-flexible constructions.

12. **Paragraph 12** mentions that in auxiliary verb constructions, APV order is slightly more common, indicating a preference for subject-initial structures.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses the fixed order of verb stem elements, which does not directly inform us about SOV/SVO but indicates a structured approach to verb morphology.

14. **Paragraph 14** mentions that non-verbal predicate constructions have a default predicate-SNV order, indicating a preference for predicate-initial structures in these cases.

15. **Paragraph 15** discusses the fixed order of verb stem elements, similar to Paragraph 13.

16. **Paragraph 16** mentions the order of lexical and auxiliary verbs, which does not directly inform us about SOV/SVO.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses fronted-VP constructions where the object must occur directly to the left of the V̄-constituent, reinforcing the idea of pre-verbal objects.

18. **Paragraph 18** mentions that fronted-VP constructions are more common with pronouns, indicating flexibility but with a tendency for pre-verbal objects.

19. **Paragraph 19** discusses the non-interruptability of the V̄-constituent, which does not directly inform us about SOV/SVO.

20. **Paragraph 20** discusses the alignment of P, T, and R in ditransitive constructions, indicating variability but with a tendency for pre-verbal objects.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Chácobo displays a dominant SOV word order. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent mention of objects preceding verbs and the flexibility in subject positioning, with a tendency for subjects to appear before verbs in many constructions.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can derive the dominant word order in Hup by analyzing the patterns and preferences described in the grammar.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the formally least-marked pattern is verb-final and identifies the basic constituent order as AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). This suggests a preference for SOV order, as the agent (subject) precedes the object and both precede the verb.

2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that in cases where there are no other clues to the identity of subject and object, Hup speakers prefer AOV order, which again aligns with SOV. It also mentions that AOV order is at least twice as common as OAV order in text counts.

3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that verb-final constituent order is basic in Hup, supporting the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 7** notes that pronominal subjects almost always immediately precede the verb, resulting in a default OAV order. However, this seems to apply more to pronominal subjects rather than full nominal arguments, which are the focus for determining basic word order.

5. **Paragraph 13** confirms that Hup has a basically verb-final constituent order characterized as AOV, reinforcing the SOV pattern.

6. **Paragraph 19** discusses the flexibility of constituent order and the strategy of expressing arguments externally to the main clause. However, it does not contradict the basic SOV order for full nominal arguments.

From these observations, it is clear that while Hup allows for some flexibility in word order due to pragmatic factors, the dominant and least-marked order in declarative sentences with full nominal arguments is SOV.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Huambisa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa (also referred to as Wampis), we can determine the dominant word order by examining the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the basic constituent order in Wampis is A P V, where A is the most Agent-like participant (subject), P is the most Patient-like participant (object), and V is the verb. This indicates a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It explicitly states that the canonical order of major clause elements in Wampis is Subject Object Verb (SOV).

3. **Paragraph 4**: Provides examples where the subject precedes the object, and both precede the verb, reinforcing the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that the most frequent word order in transitive constructions is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), although other orders are permitted in certain pragmatic environments.

5. **Paragraph 16**: Describes the ditransitive construction and states that the order of constituents is typically A T V R (Agent-Theme-Verb-Recipient), which aligns with an SOV structure.

From these points, it is clear that the dominant word order in Huambisa is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Cocama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the frequency and patterns of constituent order in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1** provides a frequency table showing that 92% of transitive declarative sentences exhibit the SVO order, while only 7% show the OSV pattern, and 1% show the SOV pattern. This indicates a strong preference for SVO order in declarative sentences.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the unmarked focus structure typically displays the SVO order and that the progressive-marked constructions (VS & SOV) are the least productive, appearing only 3% of the time in the database.

3. **Paragraph 4** discusses that in tense-marked constructions, allowable order patterns are SV, SVO, and OSV, but not SOV. This further supports the predominance of SVO order in non-progressive contexts.

4. **Paragraph 6** states that the pragmatically unmarked clause displays SVO order and that circumstantial information typically occurs in peripheral positions, reinforcing the SVO structure as the basic constituent order.

5. **Paragraph 9** explicitly mentions that declarative clauses overwhelmingly exhibit the SVO pattern, which is considered the basic constituent order in the language.

6. **Paragraph 16** confirms that in non-progressive construction types, the subject precedes the verb and the object follows it, forming an SVO pattern.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the SVO order is the dominant word order in Cocama for declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Tiriyo,"To determine the dominant word order in Tiriyo, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any explicit or implicit information about the typical arrangement of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

### Analysis of Paragraphs:

**Paragraph 2:**
- Mentions that Tiriyo could be described as a ‘split-word-order’ language, indicating variability in word order depending on clause types.

**Paragraph 3:**
- States that word order appears to be pragmatically oriented and mentions different tendencies for different clause types. Specifically, habitual past and remote past clauses tend to have OVA order.

**Paragraph 6:**
- Discusses the Cariban language family, noting that some languages in this family, like Hixkaryana, have OVS as the basic word order. It also mentions that Tiriyo is a fairly typical Cariban language.

**Paragraph 7:**
- Mentions that the ordering of constituents in simple sentences is pragmatically determined, with topical elements tending to occur in initial position. This suggests flexibility in word order.

**Paragraph 8:**
- Provides examples of sentences with different word orders (AOV and OAV), indicating variability.

**Paragraph 11:**
- Provides examples where the object noun phrase can occur both preverbally and postverbally, suggesting flexibility in word order.

**Paragraph 16:**
- Provides examples of sentences with different word orders (AOV and OAV), supporting the notion of variability.

### Reasoning:

The information provided in the paragraphs indicates that Tiriyo exhibits variability in word order depending on clause types and pragmatic factors. The language is described as having a ‘split-word-order’ and shows tendencies towards different orders in different contexts (e.g., OVA in habitual past and remote past clauses). Additionally, the examples provided show both AOV and OAV orders, further supporting the idea of flexibility.

Given this evidence, it is clear that Tiriyo does not have a single dominant word order but rather uses different orders based on various factors such as clause type and pragmatic considerations.

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can deduce the dominant word order by examining the patterns of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the constituent order in transitive clauses follows the overall AOV tendency. It also states that the order of NPs helps to determine syntactic functions of core arguments, showing a nominative–accusative ordering of arguments in relation to the predicate: SV (SXV) and AOV (AOXV).

2. **Paragraph 4**: It reiterates that the constituent order in transitive clauses follows the overall AOV tendency.

3. **Paragraph 5**: It states that the constituent order of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type but can be influenced by pragmatic factors.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It confirms the typical SV/AOV constituent order and mentions that the overt core-case marking is one of the main grammatical mechanisms to distinguish core arguments within a clause.

5. **Paragraph 8**: It summarizes that Murui has a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent ordering – S, A followed by O, occur before the V.

6. **Paragraph 12**: It provides examples of transitive clauses with AOV order and mentions that the typical constituent order is SV and AOV.

7. **Paragraph 15**: It notes that in dependent clauses, the constituent order appears to be rigid, verb-final.

8. **Paragraph 18**: It discusses the order of arguments in Murui, stating that grammatical relations are shown by the order of core arguments in relation to the predicate: SV and AOV.

From these points, it is clear that the dominant word order in Huitoto (Murui) is **AOV** for transitive clauses and **SV** for intransitive clauses. This consistent pattern across multiple paragraphs indicates a strong preference for these orders in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1**: The paragraph discusses the SVO and SOV patterns, indicating that SVO is considered the true basic word order, while SOV is marked.
   - **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph shows examples with full noun phrases as subjects and objects, demonstrating that both SVO and SOV patterns are possible.
   - **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that SVO word order appears very frequently in texts and is usually the word order that starts a discourse, supporting the idea that SVO is the basic word order.
   - **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the marked nature of SXV word order in various environments, reinforcing that SVO is the unmarked, basic word order.
   - **Paragraph 8**: This section explicitly states that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO, and that animacy, definiteness, and phrase weight do not influence this basic word order.
   - **Paragraph 11**: It concludes that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO, based on a detailed study that excludes pronouns and focuses on full nominal phrases.
   - **Paragraph 16**: It reiterates that SVO is the basic word order and conveys realis mood, while SXV is used for irrealis mood.

The consistent mention of SVO as the basic and most frequent word order, along with its use in realis mood and discourse initiation, strongly supports the conclusion that SVO is the dominant word order in Iquito.

2. **Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Movima can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** provides crucial information about the hierarchical alignment system in Movima. It mentions that word order is fixed but semantically determined. Specifically, in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded as the first core argument (ARG1), and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the second core argument (ARG2). This suggests that the word order is not strictly syntactic but rather influenced by semantic roles and animacy hierarchy.

2. **Paragraph 6** discusses the distinction between structural and oblique case in Movima. It shows examples where the verb appears before the subject and object, such as in ""usko bay-a-cho=us as wa:so"" ('He broke the glass') and ""usko bay-a-cho=us n-as wa:so"" ('He broke X inside the glass'). This indicates a verb-initial structure (VSO or VOS).

3. **Paragraph 8** mentions that Movima is syntactically fairly configurational and verb-initial, which aligns with the observations from Paragraph 6.

4. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of argument incorporation and shows that the verb often precedes the subject and object, reinforcing the verb-initial structure.

5. **Paragraph 18** discusses the use of demonstratives and their placement, which further supports the verb-initial structure as it shows the verb preceding other elements in the sentence.

6. **Paragraph 16** illustrates the use of oblique arguments and shows that the verb often comes first, followed by the subject and object.

From these observations, it is clear that Movima predominantly follows a verb-initial word order. Given the examples and descriptions, the most fitting classification for Movima's dominant word order is **VSO** (Verb-Subject-Object).

### Conclusion:
VSO",no dominant order,vso
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

     - Subject: Tsuuca (I)
     - Verb: majchone (eaten)
     - Object: ó (it)
     - Order: S V O
   - Example (654b): ""Tsuuca ó fmfbajchoja."" (I have already fixed the house.)
     - Subject: Tsuuca (I)
     - Verb: fmfbajchoja (fixed)
     - Object: ó (the house)
     - Order: S V O

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (209): ""o:?i:piè teï:né-?i."" (The dog runs.)
     - Subject: o:?i:piè (The dog)
     - Verb: teï:né-?i (runs)
     - Order: S V

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (222): ""T sa ju co ob e oohnbye."" (The dog already came.)
     - Subject: oohnbye (The dog)
     - Verb: T sa ju co ob e (already came)
     - Order: S V

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example (229): ""A vyéju u b e ihajkimuke n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki."" (The chief told his people to fix his house.)
     - Subject: A vyéju (The chief)
     - Verb: ihajkimuke (told)
     - Object: n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki (his people)
     - Order: S V O

From these examples, it is clear that the subject generally precedes the verb, and when an object is present, it follows the verb. This indicates a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Wari',"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the subject and/or object follows the verb, indicating a post-verbal position for both constituents.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the pragmatically unmarked constituent order in Wari' is VOS. This is reinforced by the description of simple sentences where the verb is the first constituent, followed by the object and then the subject.
3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the most frequent constituent word order in Wari' is VOS, although it notes that the subject occasionally precedes the object in certain contexts.
4. **Paragraph 4** confirms that the basic order of constituents in a transitive/intransitive clause is verb, object, subject (VOS), and in a ditransitive clause, it is verb, direct object, indirect object, subject.
5. **Paragraph 5** supports the VOS order by stating that when both subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object.
6. **Paragraph 12** also mentions that the basic order seems to be VOS when multiple overtly expressed constituents are present.

Given the consistent references to VOS as the most frequent or pragmatically unmarked order, it is clear that VOS is the dominant word order in Wari'.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Central Aymara can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The example ""Señora Maria is going to visit her grandmother's house"" suggests a structure where the subject precedes the object and the verb, indicating an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 3**: The phrase ""you give me"" implies a subject-object-verb structure, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 15**: The sentence ""I am going to visit Pedro's house"" again follows the SOV pattern, with the subject ""I"" (Naya), the object ""Pedro's house"" (Pedron utap), and the verb ""visit"" (sarascta).

4. **Paragraph 16**: The example ""you don't have to irrigate"" (janit khech'aflgui) shows a negative construction but still maintains the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 19**: The phrase ""Davidan forms be with-wa and 'ia, attached to the object"" suggests that the object precedes the verb, consistent with SOV order.

From these examples, it is clear that the subject typically precedes the object and the verb, indicating that the dominant word order in Central Aymara is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the dominant word order in Trumai as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that for clauses with verbal predicates, the basic or unmarked word orders are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. This suggests that the typical order for transitive clauses is AOV, which corresponds to SOV when considering the subject (A) and object (O) participants.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph states that both S and O have to come right before the verb when they are lexically realized. This reinforces the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the correlation between SV and OV, suggesting that these orders are prevalent in Trumai. This further supports the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph mentions that O is preverbal, which aligns with the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples and explicitly states that O occurs preverbally and A comes before the VP, which again supports the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the word order for attributive predicates, but it does not contradict the SOV order for verbal predicates.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Trumai for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns is SOV.

### Conclusion: SOV",no dominant order,sov

Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Yagua can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the basic constituent order is VSO, with some flexibility under pragmatically marked conditions. This indicates that the default or unmarked order is Verb-Subject-Object.
2. **Paragraph 2** supports this by listing Yagua among languages with verb-initial orders, specifically mentioning VSO.
3. **Paragraph 4** reinforces the VSO order by discussing Hawkins' universals and stating that Yagua fits the VSO type.
4. **Paragraph 5** also aligns with the VSO order, noting that the verb separates the subject and object, consistent with a VSO structure.
5. **Paragraph 17** again confirms the VSO order by explicitly stating that Yagua follows the Verb-Subject-Object order.

Other paragraphs provide additional context or discuss related typological features but do not contradict the VSO order.

**Reasoning:**
The repeated and consistent mention of VSO as the basic or dominant order in multiple paragraphs, including explicit statements and typological discussions, strongly indicates that VSO is the dominant word order in Yagua.

**Conclusion:** VSO",no dominant order,vso
Cacua,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, the dominant word order in Kakua can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Kakua has a predominant preference for an SOV order of constituents. It provides multiple examples illustrating this order and mentions that while other orders are accepted, they are less preferred and often require stricter morphological encoding of arguments. The least accepted orders are VSO and OVS. The paragraph also includes a scale of acceptability for different word orders, with SOV being the most preferred.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This summary reinforces the information from Paragraph 1, stating that Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents. It also mentions that the most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other orders are also allowed.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with different word orders but emphasizes that the preferred order is SOV. It also notes that the subject arguments are preferably sentence-initial.

5. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the basic clause structure in Kakua and states that most clause types prefer the basic SOV order of constituents.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Kakua is SOV. The grammar consistently describes SOV as the most preferred and frequently occurring order, with other orders being less common and often marked.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Yuracare as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions that subjects (S) of intransitive verbs (S) are often post-verbal (VS).
   - Objects (O) can be either pre-verbal or post-verbal with no clear preference.
   - Examples of different word orders are given: VSO, VOS, SVO, and OVS.
   - It is noted that SOV and OSV are not found in the texts analyzed.
   - The verb tends to be in the first or second position in the clause.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The word order is flexible, but overtly expressed subjects tend to be post-verbal.
   - Pre-verbal subjects are pragmatically marked (emphasized).

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Word order is relatively free, with subjects most frequently appearing post-verbally.
   - Objects occur on both sides of the verb with about equal frequency.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - There is a slight tendency for transitive subjects (A) to favor the post-verbal position.
   - Direct objects (O) do not show a clear preference for pre-verbal or post-verbal positions.

5. **Paragraph 8**:
   - The table shows various word orders, with a significant number of VS and VO orders.
   - The data suggest a preference for the verb-initial position.

6. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Extended intransitives and transitive verbs show a preference for post-verbal subjects.
   - Applied objects (E) show a slight preference for the post-verbal position.

7. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Grammatical relations are marked on the verb, and word order does not play a role in identifying grammatical relations.

8. **Paragraph 16**:
   - The ""One Lexical Argument Constraint"" suggests that only one core argument is typically overtly expressed, often the direct object (O).

9. **Paragraph 17**:
   - The template for cross-referencing prefixes shows the order of arguments on the verb, with a preference for indirect objects (IO) and affected objects (AFO) before direct objects (DO).

10. **Paragraph 18**:
    - The verb tends to be in the initial position, with various elements preceding or following it.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Yuracare exhibits a flexible word order with a tendency towards verb-initial structures. The verb often appears in the first or second position, and subjects and objects can be either pre-verbal or post-verbal. However, there is no single dominant word order that can be conclusively identified as the most frequent or basic.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, we can analyze the dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 1:**
- This paragraph explicitly states that the normal word order in a transitive sentence is subject, object, predicate.
- Example: ""An ogob kumpi."" (I coconut eat-want-to) translates to ""I want to eat coconut.""

**Paragraph 3:**
- This paragraph reiterates that the normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.
- Example: ""Omedin we mol pakcha."" (The woman bought that blouse.)

**Paragraph 8:**
- This paragraph discusses the word order in intransitive sentences, which is subject, then predicate.
- Example: ""An abarmane."" (I run-going-to) translates to ""I am going to run.""

**Paragraph 18:**
- This paragraph discusses the position of the indirect object in transitive sentences, which usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb.
- Example: ""An pega mol ukcha."" (I gave the blouse to you.)

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Kuna for declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is consistently subject-object-verb (SOV).

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Uru,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru (Uchumataqu), we can deduce the dominant word order by examining the patterns and explicit statements regarding the arrangement of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that word order in declarative clauses does not differ from the most common types found, specifically listing SOV, SV, or OV. This suggests a preference for SOV order among others.
   
2. **Paragraph 4** states that the word order of complement clauses is SOV, OV, or SV, with the complement preceding the matrix verb. This reinforces the tendency for the verb to appear at the end of the clause, which is characteristic of SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 7** explicitly states that Uchumataqu has a very strong tendency to place the verb at the end of a clause, which is a hallmark of SOV languages.

4. **Paragraph 10** directly states that the basic word order in declarative clauses is SOV, despite the language's relatively free word order.

5. **Paragraph 15** mentions that both the matrix and adverbial clauses show an unmarked declarative word order of SOV, SV, or OV, again indicating a preference for SOV.

6. **Paragraph 18** provides an example of a declarative sentence with the structure ""I drink water,"" which follows the SOV pattern: ""kuas(i) lik-s-n-u-cay wir-ki"" (water drink-su-OB2-lSG-DEC I-TOP).

These consistent references and examples across multiple paragraphs strongly indicate that the dominant word order in Uru (Uchumataqu) is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Warao can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph explicitly discusses the basic word order in Warao, mentioning that the language permits variations from the basic OSV order. It also provides examples and explanations that support the hypothesis of OSV as the basic order in Warao.
   - Example (69a-c) shows different sentence structures, but the analysis concludes that OSV is the basic order.
   - The paragraph also mentions that the FOCUS FRONTING RULE can cause variations from the basic OSV order, but these are conditioned by the discourse environment.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph further supports the OSV hypothesis by discussing the arrangement of comparatives in Warao, which aligns with the OSV order.

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph provides additional examples of OSV order in various sentence types, including transitive and dative sentences.
   - Example (2) shows a transitive sentence with OSV order: ""erike hube abu-a"" (Enrique snake bite PUNC).
   - Example (3) shows a dative sentence with OSV order: ""ma saba tamaha rieko iribu-a-e"" (lsg.O DAT this one Diego say PUNC PAST).

4. **Paragraph 14**:
   - This paragraph discusses the FOCUS FRONTING RULE and its impact on word order, reinforcing the idea that OSV is the basic order, with variations occurring due to focus fronting.

5. **Paragraph 17**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of subjective and objective pronouns in Warao, showing their placement in sentences. The examples support the OSV order by showing that subjects and objects precede the verb.

### Conclusion:
**OSV**",osv,osv
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cuiba, we can analyze the information to determine the dominant word order.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph discusses the flexibility of tagmemes order in Cuiba, with some exceptions. It mentions that the verb (+P) often occurs clause-finally but can be followed by the subject (+S) and object (+O). This suggests a possible SOV or OSV order when the verb is clause-final.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of sentences and phrases. For instance, ""he cuts meat for us"" (painta hui thaba) and ""my arm hurts"" (nemaxw taiba). However, these examples do not clearly indicate the order of subject, object, and verb in a straightforward transitive sentence.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of verb groups and their usage. For example, ""he travels down river"" (huarapareca) and ""we two hunt while standing going down river"" (pajeituncua pondecanbe). These examples show verbs in different contexts but do not provide clear SVO, SOV, or other orders.

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - This paragraph gives examples of clitic usage and sentence formation. Examples like ""she cooks for us"" (pinta seta) and ""I see you"" (catainchi) suggest a verb-initial structure (VSO or VOS). However, these examples involve pronouns and clitics, which may not reflect the order of full noun phrases.

### Reasoning:

The information provided in the paragraphs suggests that Cuiba has a flexible word order with a tendency for the verb to appear clause-finally, as indicated in Paragraph 1. However, the examples provided in other paragraphs show verb-initial structures, which complicates the determination of a single dominant order. Given the flexibility and the lack of consistent examples with full noun phrases, it is challenging to pinpoint a dominant word order definitively.

### Conclusion:

**No dominant order**

The evidence points to a flexible word order in Cuiba, with no single dominant order clearly emerging from the provided paragraphs.",sov,no dominant order
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the frequency and acceptability of different constituent orders in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of various word orders: SOV, OSV, SVO, OVS, and VOS. It explicitly states that VSO is not acceptable. It also mentions that VOS and VSO are not found in text material, although VO and VS are.
   - The paragraph concludes that except for VSO, all other clausal constituent order patterns are acceptable in the language.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph presents statistical data showing a strong preference for pre-verbal subjects (91%) and a higher frequency of post-verbal objects (60%). It also notes that clauses with co-occurring subjects and objects are rare (8% of all clauses), but among these, SV-oO is the most frequent type (77%).

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph discusses the variability in interpreting OSV as a default order and suggests that constituent order patterns are likely motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors rather than a fixed syntactic structure.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph describes Apurinã as having semi-free constituent order variation, with all six logically possible constituent order types being present.

5. **Paragraph 9**:
   - This paragraph reiterates that VSO is ungrammatical and that SOV is extremely rare in text material, although some speakers accept it in elicitation.

6. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph states that Apurinã is predominantly OV in terms of word order correlations, although VO is the most frequent order in text.

7. **Paragraph 13**:
   - This paragraph mentions that no clear-cut association has been established between discourse-pragmatic factors and constituent order types, suggesting that no single constituent order type can be convincingly associated with a single unmarked discourse-pragmatic factor.

### Conclusion:

**No dominant order**

### Reasoning Summary:

The analysis of the provided paragraphs indicates that Apurinã exhibits a high degree of flexibility in constituent order, with multiple orders being acceptable and used. Although there are tendencies (e.g., pre-verbal subjects and post-verbal objects), the language does not have a single dominant word order that can be identified as more basic or neutral than others. The variability and the influence of discourse-pragmatic factors suggest that Apurinã does not adhere to a fixed dominant word order.",svo,no dominant order
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can derive the following insights about the dominant word order in Kadiwéu:

1. **Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3**: Both paragraphs indicate that Kadiwéu has a highly flexible word order in main clauses, with possible orders including OVS, VOS, SOV, OSV, SVO, and VSO. However, Griffiths reports that the constituent order is predominantly SVO, although this might be influenced by elicitation techniques.

2. **Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 5**: These paragraphs suggest that OSV and OVS orders are avoided in isolated sentences to prevent ambiguity, but they are used when the context clarifies the roles of the subject and object.

3. **Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 15**: These paragraphs emphasize that Kadiwéu is a nonconfigurational language, meaning it has free word order and nominal phrases can be freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb.

4. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that subordinate clauses often have a VSO order, but alternative orders are also observed.

5. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph reiterates that Kadiwéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language, including free ordering of nominal phrases and the verb.

Given these points, it is clear that Kadiwéu does not have a rigid or fixed word order. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of flexibility in the ordering of subjects, objects, and verbs. While SVO might appear frequently due to elicitation techniques, the language itself allows for multiple orders without a clear dominant one.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Karajá can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language."" This is a direct statement about the dominant word order in Karajá, indicating that the subject (S) comes first, followed by the object (O), and then the verb (V).

2. **Paragraph 5** supports this by mentioning that ""Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the verb,"" which further reinforces the SOV word order.

3. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""most Macro-Jê languages are SOV,"" and since Karajá is a Macro-Jê language, this aligns with the SOV word order.

4. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of sentences that follow the SOV structure, such as:
   - ""kai r´T´-da a)-d-I-wÈèd-e"" (You ate the food that I brought)
   - ""kai ha)bu ∅-r-a-idZ´ra-d´)èr-ErIèb´)"" (You saw the man running)

5. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 19** also provide examples that follow the SOV structure, such as:
   - ""Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-e"" (A white man came ashore)
   - ""Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-eèdo wa-ritSoko ∅-r-I-ko)bra-d´)èr-a"" (A White man who came ashore bought my clay dolls)

These examples consistently show the subject preceding the object and the verb, which is characteristic of the SOV word order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
