Tamashek,"Tamashek, a variety of the Tuareg languages spoken in Mali, Niger, and Algeria, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. However, despite this flexibility, there is a tendency towards a particular order in neutral, declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Evidence:** Tamashek, like other Berber languages, uses inflectional morphology to mark grammatical relations, which allows for some flexibility in word order. However, the most common and unmarked order in simple declarative sentences tends to be Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
   - **Syntactic Patterns:** In natural discourse and elicited data, sentences often follow the SVO pattern. For example, a typical sentence might be structured as ""The man (S) ate (V) the food (O).""
   - **Comparative Data:** Studies and descriptions of Tamashek and related Tuareg languages often highlight SVO as the prevalent order, aligning with broader patterns observed in Afroasiatic languages.

Given these points, while Tamashek allows for flexibility due to its inflectional nature, the dominant and unmarked word order in declarative sentences is SVO.

**Conclusion:** SVO",vso,svo
Coptic,"Coptic, the latest stage of the Egyptian language, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. However, it does have a dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - In Coptic, the dominant word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This can be observed in many declarative sentences where the subject precedes the verb, and the verb precedes the object. For example, in the sentence ""ⲡⲉⲛⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲛⲁⲩ ⲡⲉⲛⲓⲱⲧ"" (Our God loves our father), ""ⲡⲉⲛⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ"" (our God) is the subject, ""ⲛⲁⲩ"" (loves) is the verb, and ""ⲡⲉⲛⲓⲱⲧ"" (our father) is the object.
   - This SVO order is consistent with the general tendency in Coptic texts, although variations can occur due to topicalization or emphasis, which is common in languages with flexible word orders. Nonetheless, SVO remains the unmarked, or default, word order in neutral contexts.

Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Igbo,"Igbo is a language spoken in Nigeria, and it belongs to the Niger-Congo language family. The dominant word order in Igbo is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This can be observed in typical declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

Shatt,"To determine the dominant word order in the language Shatt, we need to examine the typical syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This involves analyzing the relative positioning of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) within these sentences.

### Reasoning:

1. **Data Collection**: We would ideally start by collecting a corpus of Shatt sentences, focusing on those that are declarative and transitive, meaning they contain a subject, a verb, and an object.
2. **Sentence Analysis**: Each sentence in the corpus would be analyzed to identify the positions of the subject, object, and verb. For instance:
   - ""The cat (S) chased (V) the mouse (O).""
   - ""The mouse (O) the cat (S) chased (V).""
   - ""Chased (V) the cat (S) the mouse (O).""
3. **Frequency Calculation**: We would then calculate the frequency of each possible word order (SOV, SVO, VOS, VSO, OVS, OSV) within the collected sentences.
4. **Dominance Determination**: The word order that appears most frequently would be considered the dominant word order for Shatt.

Given that we do not have specific data from Shatt in this context, we can only hypothesize based on general linguistic principles and typological patterns. However, without concrete data, it is not possible to definitively determine the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:

Lamé,"To determine the dominant word order in Lamé, we need to analyze the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This involves examining the typical arrangement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in such sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Corpus Analysis:** If we have access to a corpus of Lamé, we would look at a representative sample of declarative sentences to see the most frequent order of S, O, and V.
   - **Fieldwork Data:** If fieldwork data is available, we would analyze elicited sentences and natural speech to identify patterns.
   - **Grammatical Descriptions:** If there are existing grammatical descriptions or linguistic studies on Lamé, these can provide insights into the dominant word order.
   - **Comparative Analysis:** If Lamé is related to other languages with known word orders, we might infer its word order based on typological patterns observed in related languages.

Given that I do not have specific data on Lamé, I will outline a hypothetical analysis based on typical methods used in linguistic typology:

- **Example Sentences:**
  - If we observe sentences like ""The man (S) the apple (O) eats (V)"" frequently, this suggests an SOV order.
  - If we observe sentences like ""The man (S) eats (V) the apple (O)"" frequently, this suggests an SVO order.
  - If we observe sentences like ""Eats (V) the man (S) the apple (O)"" frequently, this suggests a VSO order.

- **Frequency and Consistency:**
  - If one particular order appears significantly more often than others in a variety of contexts (e.g., different speakers, different types of sentences), we can consider it the dominant order.
  - If no single order appears to dominate, we might conclude that the language has no dominant order.

Without specific data on Lamé, I cannot definitively determine its word order. However, based on the typical distribution of word orders in the world's languages, we might hypothesize that Lamé could follow one of the more common patterns (SOV or SVO), unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order.",svo,no dominant order
Bininj Gun-Wok,"Bininj Gun-Wok, an Australian Aboriginal language, exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. This flexibility allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences. The language uses case marking to indicate grammatical relations, which reduces the reliance on a fixed word order to convey syntactic roles.

Studies and linguistic descriptions of Bininj Gun-Wok indicate that while different word orders are possible, there is no single dominant order that is consistently preferred in natural discourse. The choice of word order can be influenced by pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization rather than syntactic constraints.

Given this flexibility and the lack of a consistently preferred word order in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns, it is appropriate to classify Bininj Gun-Wok as having ""No dominant order.""

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wambaya,"Wambaya is an Australian Aboriginal language that exhibits a relatively free word order due to its rich morphological system, which marks grammatical relations through case marking rather than word order. This flexibility allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb in a sentence. However, despite this flexibility, there is a tendency for certain word orders to be more common in natural discourse.

Research and linguistic descriptions of Wambaya indicate that while multiple word orders are possible, there is no single dominant word order that can be identified as the most frequent or preferred in all contexts. The language's reliance on case marking for grammatical relations means that word order can be manipulated for pragmatic purposes such as emphasis or focus, rather than strictly adhering to a fixed syntactic structure.

Given this information, it is appropriate to conclude that Wambaya does not have a dominant word order in the sense defined by typological studies.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wardaman,"Wardaman is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia. Like many Australian languages, Wardaman exhibits a relatively free word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which marks grammatical relations through case marking rather than relying heavily on word order.

In Wardaman, the word order can vary significantly depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis and focus. However, despite this flexibility, there is a tendency for certain orders to be more common in neutral, declarative sentences. Studies and linguistic descriptions of Wardaman suggest that the most frequently occurring word order in such contexts is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

This tendency towards SOV order aligns with the broader typological pattern observed in many Australian languages, where the verb often appears at the end of the clause, and the subject typically precedes the object. This does not mean that other orders are not possible or used in Wardaman, but SOV appears to be the most unmarked or neutral order in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

**Reasoning:**
1. Wardaman has a relatively free word order due to its inflectional morphology.
2. Despite this flexibility, the SOV order is the most frequently observed in neutral, declarative sentences.
3. This pattern aligns with the broader typological tendencies of many Australian languages.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Gooniyandi,"Gooniyandi is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Like many Australian languages, Gooniyandi exhibits a relatively free word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which marks grammatical relations through case marking rather than word order. This flexibility allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb within a sentence.

In Gooniyandi, the word order can vary significantly depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. While SOV and SVO orders are commonly observed, other orders are also possible and frequently used. This variability indicates that there is no single dominant word order in Gooniyandi.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Richness**: Gooniyandi uses case markings to indicate grammatical relations, which reduces the reliance on a fixed word order.
2. **Pragmatic Flexibility**: The language allows for different word orders to convey different pragmatic meanings, such as emphasis or focus.
3. **Empirical Observations**: Studies and descriptions of Gooniyandi syntax indicate that multiple word orders are used in natural speech without a clear preference for one over the others.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Tiwi,"Tiwi is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Tiwi people on the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory of Australia. The language has undergone significant changes over time, and there are distinctions between the traditional Tiwi language and the modern Tiwi language.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Traditional Tiwi**: The traditional Tiwi language is known for its relatively free word order, which means that it does not have a rigidly fixed order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences. The flexibility in word order is often influenced by pragmatic factors such as emphasis and topicalization rather than strict syntactic rules. This flexibility makes it difficult to pinpoint a single dominant word order.
   - **Modern Tiwi**: In the modern Tiwi language, there has been a shift towards a more fixed word order, influenced by contact with English and other factors. However, even in modern Tiwi, there is no single dominant word order that can be consistently identified across all contexts.

Given the significant flexibility and the lack of a consistently dominant word order in both traditional and modern Tiwi, it is appropriate to conclude that Tiwi does not have a dominant word order.

**Conclusion**: No dominant order",svo,no dominant order
Nakkara,"To determine the dominant word order in Nakkara, one would typically analyze a corpus of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. This analysis would involve identifying the most frequently occurring sequence of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in these sentences.

However, since I do not have access to specific data on Nakkara's syntax, I will provide a general approach to reasoning about word order based on typological patterns and known linguistic features, if any, of Nakkara.

1. **Typological Patterns**: 
   - If Nakkara is known to be related to a language family with a predominant word order, this can provide a clue. For example, many Australian Aboriginal languages, which Nakkara might be related to, often exhibit flexible word order but may have a dominant pattern.
   
2. **Morphosyntactic Features**:
   - If Nakkara has rich inflectional morphology, it might allow for more flexible word order. However, even in such languages, there is usually a preferred or unmarked order.
   
3. **Corpus Analysis**:
   - Ideally, one would analyze a set of sentences from Nakkara to see which word order appears most frequently in natural speech or written texts.

Given the lack of specific data, I will hypothesize based on general typological tendencies and the linguistic context of Australian languages.

**Reasoning**:
- Many Australian languages exhibit flexible word order due to their rich case marking systems, which allow constituents to be identified without relying heavily on word order.
- However, even within this flexibility, there tends to be a preferred or more common order in neutral contexts.

Based on these considerations, and without specific corpus data, it is reasonable to conclude that Nakkara might not have a single dominant word order but rather a flexible system.

**Conclusion**: No dominant order",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Garrwa,"Garrwa, an Australian Aboriginal language, exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order. This flexibility is a common feature among many Australian languages, which often rely more on morphological markers than on fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships. In Garrwa, the roles of subject, object, and verb can be identified through case marking rather than their position in the sentence.

Given this flexibility, it is difficult to pinpoint a single dominant word order for declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Studies and descriptions of Garrwa indicate that the language does not consistently adhere to one specific order of constituents. Instead, the word order can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, or topicalization.

Therefore, based on the available linguistic data and the observed variability in constituent order, the most accurate classification for Garrwa is:

Conclusion: No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Ngankikurungkurr,"Ngankikurungkurr is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia. Like many Australian languages, it exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which marks grammatical relations on the nouns and verbs themselves. This allows for a relatively free word order, as the grammatical roles of the subject and object are clear from the inflections rather than their position in the sentence.

In examining the available linguistic data on Ngankikurungkurr, it becomes evident that there is no single dominant word order that is consistently used in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Instead, the language allows for various word orders depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization.

Given this flexibility and the lack of a consistently preferred word order in the data, it is appropriate to conclude that Ngankikurungkurr does not have a dominant word order in the sense defined by typological studies.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wagiman,"Wagiman is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is known for its relatively free word order, which is a common characteristic among Australian languages. This flexibility in word order means that the language does not adhere strictly to a single dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

In Wagiman, the order of subject, object, and verb can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. This variability makes it difficult to pinpoint a single dominant word order. Studies and linguistic descriptions of Wagiman indicate that the language allows for multiple word orders, and no single order is overwhelmingly preferred in all contexts.

Given this flexibility and the lack of a clear, consistent pattern that would indicate a dominant word order, the most accurate classification for Wagiman in terms of word order typology is ""No dominant order.""

**Reasoning:**
1. Wagiman exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, influenced by pragmatic factors.
2. There is no single word order that is consistently preferred in all contexts.
3. Linguistic descriptions and studies of Wagiman support the conclusion that the language does not have a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), a modern dialect of Aramaic, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb. However, there is a dominant word order that is typically observed in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Context:** Classical Aramaic, from which Neo-Aramaic descends, predominantly used the SVO order. This historical influence often persists in modern dialects.
   - **Empirical Observations:** Studies and linguistic descriptions of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) indicate that the SVO order is the most frequently used in natural speech and written texts. For example, a typical sentence structure would be ""The man (S) saw (V) the dog (O).""
   - **Comparative Analysis:** When compared with other Semitic languages, which often exhibit SVO order, Neo-Aramaic aligns with this pattern, reinforcing the prevalence of SVO in its syntax.
   - **Flexibility and Markedness:** While Neo-Aramaic allows for variations in word order to emphasize different parts of the sentence (e.g., topicalization or focus), these variations are considered marked. The unmarked, or default, order remains SVO.

**Conclusion:** SVO",sov,svo
English,"1. **Reasoning:**

English is a language that predominantly uses a fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships, rather than relying heavily on inflection. In declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the typical structure follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. 

For example:
- ""The cat (S) chased (V) the mouse (O).""
- ""John (S) reads (V) the book (O).""

In these sentences, the subject (the cat, John) precedes the verb (chased, reads), which in turn precedes the object (the mouse, the book). This pattern is consistent across most declarative sentences in English, making SVO the dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Korean,"Korean is a language that predominantly follows the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. This means that in a typical declarative sentence, the subject comes first, followed by the object, and the verb comes at the end. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Grammatical Structure:** Korean is an agglutinative language, which means it uses affixes to express grammatical relations and functions. This structure supports a relatively fixed word order, with the verb typically placed at the end of the sentence.
   - **Sentence Examples:** In Korean, a typical sentence like ""철수가 사과를 먹는다"" (Cheolsu-ga sagwa-reul meokneunda) translates to ""Cheolsu eats an apple,"" where ""철수"" (Cheolsu) is the subject, ""사과"" (sagwa) is the object, and ""먹는다"" (meokneunda) is the verb.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Numerous linguistic studies and typological surveys, such as those by Greenberg (1963) and Dryer (2013), have consistently classified Korean as an SOV language.
   - **Flexibility and Markedness:** While Korean does allow for some flexibility in word order for pragmatic reasons (such as emphasis or topicalization), the SOV order is unmarked and considered the default or neutral order.

Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Basque,"1. **Reasoning:**

Basque is a language isolate spoken in the Basque Country, which straddles the border between Spain and France. It is known for its unique grammatical structure, which is quite different from the Indo-European languages that surround it. One of the key features of Basque is its relatively free word order, which is influenced by its rich system of case marking. However, despite this flexibility, there is a dominant word order that is typically used in neutral, declarative sentences.

In Basque, the dominant word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that in a neutral declarative sentence where both the subject and the object are nouns, the subject typically comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb. This SOV order is considered the unmarked or default word order in Basque, although variations can occur due to pragmatic factors such as emphasis or topicalization.

For example:
- ""Gizona (S) emakumea (O) ikusten du (V)."" translates to ""The man sees the woman.""

In this sentence, ""gizona"" (the man) is the subject, ""emakumea"" (the woman) is the object, and ""ikusten du"" (sees) is the verb, following the SOV order.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Malayalam,"Malayalam, a Dravidian language spoken predominantly in the Indian state of Kerala, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. However, it has a dominant or preferred word order in neutral, declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Syntactic Structure:** In Malayalam, the typical sentence structure follows the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. This is evident in simple declarative sentences where the subject comes first, followed by the object, and the verb appears at the end.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""അവൻ പുസ്തകം വായിച്ചു"" (avan pustakam vāyiccu) translates to ""He read the book,"" where ""അവൻ"" (avan) is the subject, ""പുസ്തകം"" (pustakam) is the object, and ""വായിച്ചു"" (vāyiccu) is the verb.
     - ""അവൾ ഭക്ഷണം പാചകം ചെയ്തു"" (avaḷ bhakṣaṇaṁ pācakam ceytu) translates to ""She cooked the food,"" where ""അവൾ"" (avaḷ) is the subject, ""ഭക്ഷണം"" (bhakṣaṇaṁ) is the object, and ""പാചകം ചെയ്തു"" (pācakam ceytu) is the verb.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Various linguistic studies and typological surveys of Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, consistently identify SOV as the dominant word order. This is supported by the syntactic patterns observed in natural speech and written texts.

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Iu Mien,"Iu Mien is a language spoken by the Iu Mien people, primarily in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Hmong-Mien language family. To determine the dominant word order in Iu Mien, we need to look at the typical structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

Based on linguistic studies and descriptions of Iu Mien, the dominant word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This is evidenced by the typical sentence structure observed in the language, where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb. For example, a sentence like ""The man eats rice"" would be structured as ""Man eats rice"" in Iu Mien, aligning with the SVO order.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Iu Mien grammar indicate that the subject typically comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object. This is consistent with the SVO word order.
2. **Sentence Examples**: Examples from Iu Mien texts and linguistic studies show that declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects follow the SVO pattern.
3. **Typological Consistency**: The SVO order is common among languages in the region and within the Hmong-Mien language family, supporting the classification of Iu Mien as having an SVO dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Semelai,"Semelai is an Austroasiatic language spoken by the Semelai people in Malaysia. The dominant word order in Semelai has been studied and documented by various linguists. According to research, Semelai exhibits a relatively flexible word order, but there is a tendency towards a particular structure in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies on Semelai, such as those by Nicole Kruspe, indicate that the language tends to follow a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in its basic declarative sentences. This is consistent with the broader typological patterns observed in many Austroasiatic languages.
   - **Sentence Structure:** In typical declarative sentences, the subject usually precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb. This pattern is observed in natural speech and written texts.
   - **Flexibility:** While Semelai allows for some flexibility in word order due to pragmatic factors like emphasis or topicalization, the SVO order remains the most frequently occurring and unmarked structure.

**Conclusion:** SVO",no dominant order,svo
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"Yukaghir (Kolyma) is a language spoken in northeastern Siberia, and it is known for its relatively free word order due to its rich morphological system. However, despite this flexibility, there is a dominant word order that can be identified in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Yukaghir (Kolyma) is an agglutinative language with a complex system of case marking that allows for a relatively free word order. This means that the grammatical roles of the subject and object are often indicated by case markers rather than word order.
   - Despite this flexibility, studies and linguistic descriptions of Yukaghir (Kolyma) indicate that the most frequently occurring word order in natural discourse is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the typological tendency of many languages with rich case marking systems.
   - The SOV order is observed in both elicited data and naturalistic texts, suggesting that it is the unmarked or default order, even though other orders are possible for pragmatic reasons such as emphasis or focus.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Georgian,"Georgian is a language that exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which marks grammatical relations through case endings rather than word position. This flexibility allows for various word orders to be used depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. 

However, despite this flexibility, there is a tendency for certain word orders to be more common in neutral, declarative sentences. In the case of Georgian, the most frequently observed word order in such contexts is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the typological pattern found in many other languages with rich inflectional systems, where the verb tends to appear at the end of the clause.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Inflectional Morphology:** Georgian uses case markings to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns, which allows for flexibility in word order. However, in neutral contexts, the SOV order is often preferred.
   - **Pragmatic Factors:** While Georgian can use various word orders to highlight different parts of the sentence, the unmarked, or default, order in simple declarative sentences tends to be SOV.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Research and linguistic descriptions of Georgian often note that SOV is the most common order in neutral contexts, even though other orders are possible and used for specific pragmatic purposes.

Conclusion: SOV",no dominant order,sov
Alutor,"Alutor is a language spoken by the Alutor people in the northeastern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. It belongs to the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family. Like many languages in this family, Alutor exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which marks grammatical relations through case endings rather than word position.

In Alutor, the word order can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis or focus. However, the most frequently occurring and unmarked word order in neutral declarative sentences, where both the subject and the object are nouns, is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the general tendency observed in many languages with rich morphological marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Marking**: Alutor uses case markings to indicate grammatical relations, which allows for flexibility in word order. Despite this flexibility, the SOV order is the most common and unmarked structure in neutral contexts.
2. **Linguistic Studies**: Research on Alutor and related languages in the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family indicates a preference for SOV order. This is supported by linguistic descriptions and field studies that document sentence structures in natural speech.
3. **Cross-linguistic Patterns**: The SOV order is prevalent in many languages with similar morphological characteristics, suggesting a typological alignment.

### Conclusion:
SOV",no dominant order,sov
Thai,"Thai is a language that predominantly follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in declarative sentences. This means that in a typical sentence, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object. 

### Reasoning:
1. **Sentence Structure**: In Thai, a typical declarative sentence with both subject and object as nouns follows the SVO order. For example:
   - ""เด็ก กิน ข้าว"" (dek kin khao) translates to ""The child eats rice,"" where ""เด็ก"" (dek) is the subject (the child), ""กิน"" (kin) is the verb (eats), and ""ข้าว"" (khao) is the object (rice).

2. **Consistency**: This SVO structure is consistently observed in Thai sentences, making it the dominant word order. While Thai can exhibit some flexibility in word order for emphasis or topicalization, the SVO order remains the unmarked, default structure.

3. **Typological Classification**: Thai, like many other languages in the Southeast Asian linguistic area, aligns with the SVO typology. This is consistent with the broader typological patterns observed in the region.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Nganasan,"Nganasan is a Samoyedic language spoken in northern Siberia. It exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb without causing ambiguity. However, despite this flexibility, there is a tendency towards a particular order in neutral, declarative sentences.

In Nganasan, the most frequently observed word order in such sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the general typological pattern found in many Uralic languages, where the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Richness**: Nganasan, like other Uralic languages, uses extensive case marking to indicate grammatical relations, which allows for flexibility in word order. However, the default or unmarked order tends to be SOV.
2. **Typological Consistency**: Within the Uralic language family, SOV is a common word order. Nganasan aligns with this pattern.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Studies and descriptive grammars of Nganasan often illustrate sentences in the SOV order when presenting neutral, declarative sentences. This suggests a preference for this order in the absence of pragmatic factors that might motivate a different arrangement.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"Nivkh (South Sakhalin) is a language that exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich morphological system, which allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb. However, despite this flexibility, there is a dominant word order that can be identified in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Evidence:** Nivkh is an agglutinative language with a complex system of affixes that mark grammatical relations. This morphological richness allows for a degree of flexibility in word order, but it does not eliminate the presence of a dominant order.
   - **Syntactic Patterns:** Studies and linguistic descriptions of Nivkh, particularly those focusing on South Sakhalin dialects, indicate that the most frequently occurring word order in natural discourse is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the typological tendency of many languages with rich inflectional morphology.
   - **Pragmatic Considerations:** While Nivkh can use different word orders to emphasize different parts of the sentence or to convey specific pragmatic nuances, the unmarked, neutral order in declarative sentences is SOV.

Given these points, the dominant word order for Nivkh (South Sakhalin) is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Jarawa (in Andamans),"The Jarawa language, spoken by the Jarawa people of the Andaman Islands, is not extensively documented, but available linguistic studies and fieldwork provide some insights into its syntactic structure. Based on the research conducted by linguists who have studied the language, the dominant word order in Jarawa appears to be Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Field Studies:** Linguistic fieldwork on Jarawa, such as the work by Anvita Abbi and other researchers, indicates that the language predominantly follows an SOV word order. This is observed in the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.
   - **Comparative Analysis:** Jarawa shares typological features with other languages in the Andamanese family, which also tend to exhibit SOV word order. This consistency across related languages supports the conclusion that SOV is the dominant order in Jarawa.
   - **Sentence Examples:** Examples from documented Jarawa sentences show a pattern where the subject precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end. For instance, a typical sentence structure would place the subject first, followed by the object, and then the verb.

Given these points, the evidence supports the conclusion that the dominant word order in Jarawa is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Nahali,"Nahali, also known as Nihali, is a language spoken in central India, primarily in the state of Maharashtra. It is considered a language isolate, meaning it has no known relatives. The study of Nahali's syntax, including its word order, has been limited due to the language's small number of speakers and the lack of extensive linguistic research.

However, based on the available linguistic data, Nahali exhibits a relatively flexible word order. This flexibility is often seen in languages with rich inflectional morphology, where grammatical relations are marked by inflections rather than by word order. In such languages, the word order can be used to convey pragmatic information, such as emphasis or focus.

Despite this flexibility, there is a tendency for Nahali to follow a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order in neutral, declarative sentences. This is consistent with the word order patterns found in many other languages of the region, including Dravidian and some Indo-Aryan languages, which also predominantly use SOV order.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Data**: Limited but available linguistic data on Nahali suggests a tendency towards SOV order in neutral contexts.
2. **Regional Influence**: The SOV order is common in the surrounding linguistic environment, which may influence Nahali.
3. **Flexibility**: While Nahali exhibits flexibility in word order, the SOV order appears to be the unmarked or neutral choice.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Kusunda,"Kusunda is a language isolate spoken in Nepal, and it has been the subject of various linguistic studies due to its unique characteristics and endangered status. Determining the dominant word order in Kusunda can be challenging due to the limited amount of data and the language's flexible syntax.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Kusunda exhibits a high degree of syntactic flexibility, and it does not adhere strictly to a single dominant word order. This flexibility is partly due to the language's reliance on other grammatical markers, such as case marking, to indicate the roles of nouns in a sentence.
   - Studies and field reports on Kusunda have shown that sentences can be constructed with varying word orders, and there is no strong preference for one particular order over others. This variability suggests that Kusunda does not have a fixed dominant word order.
   - The lack of a dominant word order is not uncommon in languages with rich inflectional morphology, where the grammatical relationships between words are indicated by inflections rather than by word order.

Given the evidence from linguistic studies and fieldwork, it is reasonable to conclude that Kusunda does not exhibit a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",sov,no dominant order
Udihe,"Udihe, a Tungusic language spoken in Russia, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich morphological system. However, despite this flexibility, there is a dominant word order that can be identified in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Richness:** Udihe, like other Tungusic languages, uses extensive case marking to indicate grammatical relations. This allows for a degree of flexibility in word order.
   - **Empirical Studies:** Linguistic studies and fieldwork on Udihe have shown that the most frequently occurring word order in natural discourse is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with many other languages in the Tungusic family.
   - **Typological Consistency:** The SOV order aligns with the typological tendencies of other languages in the region and family, which often exhibit SOV as the dominant order due to historical and structural reasons.

Given these points, the dominant word order in Udihe is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Ingush,"Ingush is a language spoken in the North Caucasus region, and it belongs to the Nakh-Daghestanian (Northeast Caucasian) language family. To determine the dominant word order in Ingush, we need to consider the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Research:** Studies on Ingush, such as those by Johanna Nichols and other linguists specializing in Caucasian languages, indicate that Ingush typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. This is consistent with the general typological characteristics of many languages in the Northeast Caucasian family.
   - **Sentence Structure:** In declarative sentences, the subject usually precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end. For example, a typical sentence structure in Ingush might be ""The man (S) the book (O) reads (V).""
   - **Flexibility:** While Ingush does exhibit some flexibility in word order due to its rich case marking system, the SOV order is the most unmarked and frequently observed structure in natural discourse.

Given these points, the dominant word order in Ingush can be identified as SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Lezgian,"Lezgian is a language spoken in the northeastern Caucasus region, primarily in southern Dagestan, Russia, and parts of Azerbaijan. It belongs to the Lezgic branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Research on Lezgian, such as the work by Martin Haspelmath, indicates that the language predominantly follows the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. This is consistent with many other languages in the Northeast Caucasian family.
   - **Sentence Structure:** In typical declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the verb tends to appear at the end of the sentence. For example, a sentence like ""The boy (S) the book (O) reads (V)"" would be structured as ""The boy the book reads"" in Lezgian.
   - **Grammatical Marking:** Lezgian, like many other languages with SOV order, uses case marking to indicate grammatical relations, which allows for relatively flexible word order. However, the unmarked or neutral order remains SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Galo,"Galo is a language spoken in the northeastern part of India, primarily in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the Tani branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The dominant word order in Galo has been studied and documented by various linguists.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - According to linguistic studies and fieldwork conducted on Galo, the language predominantly follows the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. This is consistent with many other languages in the Sino-Tibetan family, particularly those in the Tibeto-Burman subgroup.
   - In typical declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the subject usually precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end. For example, a sentence like ""The man (S) the book (O) reads (V)"" would follow this SOV structure.
   - This word order is also reflected in the structure of noun phrases and other syntactic constructions within the language, further reinforcing the SOV pattern as the dominant order.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"Yup'ik (Norton Sound) is a member of the Eskimo-Aleut language family, specifically within the Yupik branch. The word order in Yup'ik languages, including Norton Sound Yup'ik, is generally considered to be flexible due to the rich inflectional morphology that marks grammatical relations. However, there is a tendency towards a particular order in neutral, declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Richness:** Yup'ik languages have a highly inflected morphology, which means that grammatical relations are often indicated by affixes rather than word order. This allows for a relatively free word order.
   - **Pragmatic Factors:** The word order can change depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis or focus. However, in neutral contexts, there is a tendency for a specific order.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies on Yup'ik languages, including Norton Sound Yup'ik, suggest that the most common word order in neutral, declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the general tendency in many languages with rich inflectional morphology.

Given these points, the dominant word order in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Yuki,"Yuki is a language that was historically spoken by the Yuki people in Northern California. It is now considered extinct. The dominant word order in Yuki is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Yuki, like many other Native American languages, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. However, linguistic studies and documentation of the language, such as those by Mary Haas and other linguists, indicate that the most common and unmarked order in declarative sentences is SOV.
   - This means that in typical transitive sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the subject tends to precede the object, and the verb comes at the end of the sentence. For example, a sentence like ""The man (S) the dog (O) saw (V)"" would typically be ordered as ""The man the dog saw"" in Yuki.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Pipil,"Pipil, also known as Nawat, is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Pipil people in El Salvador. The dominant word order in Pipil has been a subject of study, and it is generally characterized by a flexible word order. However, there is a tendency towards a particular structure in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical and Comparative Evidence:** Pipil is closely related to Nahuatl, which typically exhibits a verb-initial word order (VSO). This historical relationship suggests that Pipil might share similar syntactic structures.
   - **Descriptive Studies:** Linguistic descriptions of Pipil often note that the verb tends to appear at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the subject and then the object. This aligns with the VSO pattern.
   - **Pragmatic Flexibility:** While Pipil allows for flexibility in word order to emphasize different parts of the sentence (e.g., topicalization or focus), the unmarked or neutral order in declarative sentences tends to be verb-initial.

Given these points, the dominant word order in Pipil is most accurately described as VSO.

**Conclusion:** VSO",no dominant order,vso
Micmac,"To determine the dominant word order in the Micmac language, we need to examine the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Micmac, also known as Mi'kmaq, is an Algonquian language spoken by the Mi'kmaq people in Canada and the United States.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Micmac is known for its relatively free word order, which is a characteristic of many Algonquian languages. This flexibility is due to the rich inflectional morphology that marks grammatical relations, making the order of constituents less crucial for conveying meaning.
   - Despite this flexibility, studies and linguistic descriptions of Micmac suggest that there is no single dominant word order that is consistently preferred in all contexts. Instead, the word order can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization.
   - In practice, Micmac speakers may use different word orders interchangeably, and the context often dictates the arrangement of subject, object, and verb. This variability makes it difficult to pinpoint a dominant word order.

Given the evidence of flexible word order and the lack of a consistently preferred structure in declarative sentences, it is appropriate to conclude that Micmac does not have a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",vos,no dominant order
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"To determine the dominant word order in Tepehua (Huehuetla), we need to examine the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Tepehua is a Totonacan language spoken in Mexico, and like many indigenous languages, it exhibits certain typological features that can help us identify its dominant word order.

1. **Linguistic Data and Analysis:**
   - **Subject-Verb Agreement:** In Tepehua, verbs often agree with the subject in person and number, which can provide clues about the positioning of the subject relative to the verb.
   - **Sentence Examples:** Analyzing sentence structures from available linguistic descriptions and texts, we observe patterns in the placement of the subject, object, and verb.
   - **Field Studies and Descriptions:** Linguistic fieldwork and descriptions by researchers such as Yolanda Lastra and others provide insights into the typical sentence constructions in Tepehua.

2. **Observations:**
   - **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):** There are instances where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb. For example, ""The man (S) eats (V) the corn (O).""
   - **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):** There are also instances where the subject and object precede the verb. For example, ""The man (S) the corn (O) eats (V).""
   - **Flexibility:** While both SVO and SOV structures are observed, the frequency and naturalness of these structures in spontaneous speech and texts need to be considered to determine the dominant order.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis of linguistic data and descriptions, Tepehua (Huehuetla) does not exhibit a strong preference for a single word order in declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects. Both SVO and SOV orders are used, and the choice can be influenced by pragmatic factors such as emphasis or focus.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Musqueam,"Musqueam, also known as hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓, is a dialect of the Halkomelem language, which belongs to the Salishan language family. Salishan languages, including Musqueam, are known for their relatively flexible word order. However, they often exhibit a tendency towards a particular order in neutral, declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Flexible Word Order:** Musqueam, like other Salishan languages, exhibits a flexible word order, meaning that the order of subject, object, and verb can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis or focus.
   - **Tendency Towards VSO:** Despite this flexibility, there is a tendency for verb-initial orders, particularly VSO (Verb-Subject-Object), in neutral declarative sentences. This is a common feature in many Salishan languages.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies and linguistic descriptions of Musqueam and related Salishan languages often highlight the prevalence of VSO order in neutral contexts. For example, in a simple declarative sentence where both the subject and object are nouns, the verb typically precedes the subject and object.

Given these points, while Musqueam allows for various word orders, the dominant or most frequent order in neutral declarative sentences is VSO.

**Conclusion:** VSO",vso,vso
Omaha,"Omaha, a Siouan language spoken by the Omaha people, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich morphological system. However, linguistic research and documentation suggest that the dominant word order in Omaha is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Evidence:** Omaha, like many other Siouan languages, uses a system of affixes to indicate grammatical relations, which allows for some flexibility in word order. Despite this flexibility, the SOV order is most frequently observed in natural speech and documented texts.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies on Omaha syntax, such as those by Catherine Rudin and other linguists specializing in Siouan languages, have noted that the SOV order is the most common and unmarked word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.
   - **Comparative Analysis:** When comparing Omaha to other Siouan languages, which also predominantly exhibit SOV order, it is consistent to classify Omaha within the same typological framework.

Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Washo,"Washo is a Native American language spoken in the area around Lake Tahoe in the United States. It is known for its relatively free word order, which can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis and focus. However, linguistic studies and fieldwork have shown that there is a tendency towards a particular word order in neutral, declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Washo exhibits a flexible word order, but research indicates that the most frequently occurring order in neutral, declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the typological pattern observed in many other languages with flexible word order, where SOV tends to be the default or unmarked order.
   - Studies such as those by Jacobsen (1964) and Mithun (1999) have documented instances of Washo sentences where the SOV order is predominant. For example, in sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the verb typically appears at the end of the sentence.
   - Although Washo allows for variations in word order due to topicalization, focus, or other discourse-related factors, the SOV order is the most common and can be considered the dominant order in neutral contexts.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Koasati,"Koasati, also known as Coushatta, is a Muskogean language spoken by the Coushatta people in Louisiana and Texas. The language exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb in a sentence. However, linguistic studies and descriptive grammars of Koasati indicate that there is a preferred or dominant word order in declarative sentences when both the subject and the object are nouns.

In Koasati, the dominant word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is evidenced by the fact that in neutral, unmarked declarative sentences, the subject typically precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end of the sentence. This SOV order is consistent with the general typological characteristics of many other Muskogean languages.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Evidence**: Koasati uses suffixes and inflectional morphology to mark grammatical relations, which allows for flexibility in word order. However, the default or unmarked order in declarative sentences tends to be SOV.
2. **Descriptive Studies**: Linguistic descriptions and field studies of Koasati, such as those by Geoffrey Kimball, indicate that SOV is the most common and preferred order in neutral contexts.
3. **Comparative Evidence**: Other Muskogean languages, such as Choctaw and Chickasaw, also predominantly use SOV order, supporting the typological consistency within the language family.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Chumash (Barbareño),"Chumash (Barbareño) is a language from the Chumashan family, traditionally spoken in the coastal regions of Southern California. The word order in Chumash languages, including Barbareño, is known to be quite flexible. This flexibility is largely due to the rich morphological system that marks grammatical relations, allowing for various permutations of subject, object, and verb without causing ambiguity.

In Chumash (Barbareño), the word order can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. While there are instances of SOV, SVO, VSO, and other orders, no single order consistently dominates in all contexts. The language's reliance on morphological markers rather than fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships supports this flexibility.

Given this information, the most accurate classification for the dominant word order in Chumash (Barbareño) is ""No dominant order.""

**Reasoning:**
1. Chumash (Barbareño) exhibits a high degree of word order flexibility.
2. The language uses morphological markers to indicate grammatical relations, reducing reliance on a fixed word order.
3. Various word orders (SOV, SVO, VSO, etc.) are used depending on pragmatic needs, with no single order being predominant.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",vos,no dominant order
Yuchi,"Yuchi, also known as Euchee, is a language isolate spoken by the Yuchi people in the southeastern United States. The language has been extensively studied, and its syntactic structure has been documented in various linguistic works.

1. **Reasoning:**
   Yuchi exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology, which allows for different constituent orders to be used without causing ambiguity. However, despite this flexibility, linguistic studies and fieldwork have shown that the most frequently occurring and unmarked word order in Yuchi declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This order is considered the default or dominant word order in the language, especially when both the subject and the object are nouns.

   For example, in a typical Yuchi sentence, the subject noun precedes the object noun, and the verb comes at the end:
   - ""The man (subject) the dog (object) sees (verb).""

   This SOV structure aligns with the dominant word order found in many other languages with similar morphological characteristics.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Alsea,"Alsea is an extinct language that was spoken by the Alsea people on the central Oregon coast. The language has been documented primarily through the work of linguists such as Leo J. Frachtenberg in the early 20th century. Given the limited documentation and the fact that Alsea is no longer spoken, determining the dominant word order relies heavily on the analysis of available texts and linguistic descriptions.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Documentation:** Frachtenberg's work on Alsea provides some insight into its syntactic structure. However, the documentation is not extensive enough to provide a comprehensive analysis of all possible sentence structures.
   - **Linguistic Analysis:** Based on the available texts and linguistic descriptions, Alsea appears to exhibit a relatively flexible word order. This flexibility is often a characteristic of languages with rich inflectional morphology, which allows for various word orders without losing grammatical clarity.
   - **Examples and Patterns:** The examples provided in Frachtenberg's documentation do not consistently adhere to a single word order pattern. Instances of SOV, SVO, and other orders can be found, suggesting that no single word order is overwhelmingly dominant.

Given the evidence from historical documentation and linguistic analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that Alsea does not have a single dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order.",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Arikara,"Arikara is a Caddoan language spoken by the Arikara people in North Dakota. To determine the dominant word order of Arikara, we need to look at the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Arikara, like other Caddoan languages, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. This means that the language uses inflections to convey grammatical relationships, allowing for different word orders to be used pragmatically.
   - Despite this flexibility, linguistic studies and descriptive grammars of Arikara indicate that the most frequently occurring word order in natural discourse is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the general tendency observed in many Native American languages.
   - For example, in a typical declarative sentence, you might find structures like ""The man (S) the horse (O) saw (V)"" aligning with the SOV order.
   - However, due to the flexibility and the influence of pragmatic factors, other word orders can also be found in the language, but they are less common compared to SOV.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Takelma,"Takelma is a language that was spoken by the Takelma people in southwestern Oregon. It is a member of the Penutian language family. The dominant word order in Takelma has been studied and documented by linguists, particularly by Edward Sapir, who conducted extensive research on the language.

1. Reasoning:
Takelma exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich morphological system, which allows for a variety of syntactic arrangements. However, despite this flexibility, there is a discernible dominant word order in Takelma. According to Sapir's analysis and subsequent linguistic studies, the most common and unmarked word order in Takelma declarative sentences, where both the subject and the object are nouns, is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with the typological tendencies of many languages with rich inflectional morphology, where the verb tends to appear at the end of the clause.

Conclusion: SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Jemez,"Jemez is a Tanoan language spoken by the Jemez Pueblo people in New Mexico. In examining the syntactic structure of Jemez, it is important to consider the typical arrangement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Jemez exhibits a relatively flexible word order, but it tends to follow a pattern where the verb often appears at the end of the sentence. This suggests a preference for the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.
   - Linguistic studies and descriptive grammars of Jemez indicate that while there is some flexibility due to pragmatic factors, the most frequent and unmarked order in declarative sentences is SOV.
   - This SOV order is consistent with the typological characteristics of many other Native American languages, which often exhibit verb-final structures.

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Zuni,"Zuni, a language spoken by the Zuni people in New Mexico, exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its polysynthetic nature. In polysynthetic languages, words often consist of many morphemes that convey a lot of grammatical information, which allows for more flexibility in the arrangement of constituents within a sentence.

However, despite this flexibility, linguistic research and descriptive grammars of Zuni indicate that there is a tendency towards a particular word order in declarative sentences when both the subject and the object are nouns. This tendency is towards the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Polysynthetic Nature:** Zuni's polysynthetic nature allows for a high degree of inflection and incorporation, which can lead to flexible word order. However, even in such languages, a dominant or preferred order can often be identified.
   - **Descriptive Studies:** Studies and grammatical descriptions of Zuni, such as those by linguists like Stanley Newman, have noted that while Zuni allows for various word orders, the SOV order appears to be the most frequently occurring in natural discourse.
   - **Cross-Linguistic Patterns:** In many polysynthetic languages, SOV is a common order due to the way verb morphology interacts with noun phrases.

Given these points, while Zuni allows for flexibility, the dominant word order in declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Rama,"Rama is a Chibchan language spoken by the Rama people on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. The language has been studied to some extent, and its syntactic structure has been documented in various linguistic works.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Word Order Analysis:** According to linguistic studies on Rama, the language exhibits a relatively flexible word order. However, there is a tendency for the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order in declarative sentences when both the subject and the object are nouns. This is consistent with the typological characteristics of many indigenous languages in the Americas.
   - **Examples from Linguistic Data:** In documented examples of Rama sentences, the SOV order appears frequently. For instance, sentences where the subject and object are clearly marked and the verb appears at the end are common.
   - **Linguistic Research:** Research by linguists such as Craig and others who have worked on the Rama language supports the observation that SOV is the dominant word order, despite some flexibility in the language.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Tonkawa,"Tonkawa is a Native American language historically spoken by the Tonkawa people in present-day Texas. The language is now considered extinct, but it has been documented and studied by linguists.

1. **Reasoning:**
   Tonkawa exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order due to its polysynthetic nature. In polysynthetic languages, words often consist of many morphemes that convey a large amount of grammatical information, which can lead to a more flexible syntax. In the case of Tonkawa, the language does not adhere strictly to a single dominant word order. Instead, it allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb, depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis and focus. This flexibility means that no single word order can be identified as dominant in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

   Studies and linguistic descriptions of Tonkawa, such as those by Harry Hoijer, indicate that the language does not consistently use one specific word order over others. This variability is a hallmark of languages that rely heavily on morphological markers to indicate grammatical relationships rather than fixed syntactic positions.

2. **Conclusion:**
   No dominant order",sov,no dominant order
Tunica,"Tunica is a language isolate that was historically spoken by the Tunica people in what is now the southeastern United States. The language has been extensively documented, particularly by Mary Haas in the early 20th century. Based on her work and other linguistic studies, we can analyze the word order in Tunica.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Tunica exhibits a relatively flexible word order, but there is evidence to suggest a preference for certain structures in declarative sentences.
   - In many documented sentences, the verb tends to appear at the end of the clause, which aligns with the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.
   - However, there are also instances where the verb appears in the middle (SVO) or even at the beginning (VSO), indicating some level of flexibility.
   - Despite this flexibility, the most frequently occurring pattern in the data is SOV, suggesting it is the dominant order.

Given the evidence from linguistic documentation, the dominant word order in Tunica appears to be SOV, even though the language allows for some variation.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Wappo,"Wappo is a language that belongs to the Yukian language family, historically spoken in Northern California. The dominant word order in Wappo has been studied and documented by various linguists. According to the research, Wappo exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich morphological system, which allows for a significant degree of freedom in the arrangement of constituents. However, despite this flexibility, there is a preferred or dominant word order that can be identified.

In Wappo, the dominant word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of naturalistic data and elicited sentences, where the SOV order appears most frequently in declarative sentences when both the subject and the object are nouns. This order aligns with the typological tendency observed in many other languages around the world.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Evidence**: Wappo has a complex system of suffixes and inflections that mark grammatical relations, which allows for flexibility in word order. Despite this, the SOV order is the most common and unmarked structure in declarative sentences.
2. **Syntactic Patterns**: In naturalistic speech and elicited examples, sentences with a clear subject, object, and verb most frequently follow the SOV pattern.
3. **Typological Consistency**: The SOV order is consistent with the typological characteristics of many other languages with rich morphological systems, where the verb tends to come at the end of the clause.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Ute,"Ute is a Southern Numic language spoken by the Ute people in the western United States. The word order in Ute is relatively flexible due to its rich inflectional morphology, which allows for various permutations of subject, object, and verb without causing ambiguity. However, linguistic studies and descriptive grammars of Ute indicate that there is a tendency towards a particular word order in neutral, declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Ute is known to exhibit a flexible word order, but the most frequently occurring order in natural discourse and in elicited sentences tends to be Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is consistent with many other Native American languages, which often prefer SOV order.
   - In Ute, the verb typically appears at the end of the sentence, which aligns with the SOV structure. This order is observed in both spoken and written forms of the language.
   - Although Ute allows for variations in word order for pragmatic reasons (such as emphasis or topicalization), the SOV order is considered the unmarked or default order in neutral contexts.

**Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Yurok,"Yurok is a language of the Algic family, spoken by the Yurok people in northwestern California. It is known for its relatively free word order, which is influenced by pragmatic factors such as focus and topicalization. However, when examining the dominant or most frequently occurring word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, certain patterns can be discerned.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Flexibility and Pragmatic Factors:** Yurok exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order, often influenced by the need to highlight certain elements of the sentence for pragmatic reasons. This flexibility can make it challenging to pinpoint a single dominant word order.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies of Yurok syntax, such as those by linguists like R. H. Robins and others, have noted that while the language allows for various word orders, there is no single word order that overwhelmingly dominates in usage.
   - **Examples and Data:** Examination of Yurok texts and elicited sentences shows variability in the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs. Sentences can be found in SOV, SVO, VSO, and other configurations, depending on the context and emphasis.

Given the above points, it is clear that Yurok does not adhere strictly to one dominant word order but rather employs a variety of orders based on contextual needs.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Nuuchahnulth,"Nuuchahnulth, also known as Nuu-chah-nulth or Nootka, is a Wakashan language spoken by the Nuu-chah-nulth people on the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The language is known for its polysynthetic nature, which means that it often forms complex words that can express what would be entire sentences in other languages. This polysynthetic nature can influence the flexibility of word order in the language.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Polysynthetic Structure:** Nuuchahnulth's polysynthetic structure allows for a high degree of morphological complexity within single words, which can encode much of the grammatical information that would otherwise be conveyed through word order in less morphologically rich languages.
   - **Flexibility in Word Order:** Due to its polysynthetic nature, Nuuchahnulth exhibits significant flexibility in word order. This flexibility means that the language does not rely heavily on a fixed order of subject, object, and verb to convey meaning.
   - **Pragmatic Factors:** In Nuuchahnulth, word order can be influenced by pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. This further contributes to the variability in the order of constituents in declarative sentences.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Studies and descriptions of Nuuchahnulth have noted that there is no single dominant word order that consistently appears in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns. Instead, various orders can be used depending on the context and the specific communicative needs of the speaker.

Given these points, it is clear that Nuuchahnulth does not adhere to a single dominant word order. The language's polysynthetic nature and the influence of pragmatic factors result in a flexible approach to the arrangement of subject, object, and verb.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Columbia-Wenatchi is a Salishan language spoken in the United States, specifically in the state of Washington. Salishan languages are known for their relatively free word order due to their polysynthetic nature, which means that they often use extensive inflection and derivation to convey grammatical relationships. This characteristic allows for a high degree of flexibility in the arrangement of subjects, objects, and verbs within a sentence.

In the case of Columbia-Wenatchi, the language does not adhere strictly to a single dominant word order. Instead, the word order can vary significantly depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization. This flexibility is typical of many polysynthetic languages, where the morphological complexity of the verb can encode much of the grammatical information that word order conveys in other languages.

Given the variability and the lack of a strict, consistent pattern in the arrangement of subjects, objects, and verbs, it is appropriate to classify Columbia-Wenatchi as having ""No dominant order.""

**Reasoning:**
1. Columbia-Wenatchi is a polysynthetic language, which typically allows for flexible word order.
2. The language uses extensive inflection and derivation, reducing the need for a fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships.
3. Pragmatic factors such as emphasis and focus play a significant role in determining word order in sentences.
4. There is no consistent, dominant pattern in the arrangement of subjects, objects, and verbs.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",vos,no dominant order
Hidatsa,"Hidatsa is a Siouan language spoken by the Hidatsa people in North Dakota. To determine the dominant word order in Hidatsa, we need to examine the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Studies:** According to linguistic studies on Hidatsa, the language exhibits a relatively flexible word order due to its rich inflectional morphology. However, there is a preferred or dominant order that can be identified.
   - **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):** In Hidatsa, the most common and unmarked word order in declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that the subject typically precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end of the sentence. For example, a typical sentence structure would be ""The man (subject) the horse (object) saw (verb).""
   - **Cross-Linguistic Comparison:** The SOV order is consistent with many other languages that have similar morphological characteristics, where the verb tends to be placed at the end of the sentence.

Given the evidence from linguistic research and the syntactic patterns observed in Hidatsa, the dominant word order can be identified as SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Toqabaqita,"Toqabaqita is an Oceanic language spoken in the Solomon Islands. The dominant word order in Toqabaqita is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). This conclusion is based on linguistic research and documentation of the language, which shows that the typical structure of declarative sentences in Toqabaqita places the subject first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Documentation**: Studies and grammatical descriptions of Toqabaqita indicate that sentences typically follow the SVO order. For example, in sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the subject precedes the verb, and the verb precedes the object.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: As an Oceanic language, Toqabaqita shares typological features with other languages in the region, many of which also exhibit SVO order.
3. **Sentence Structure**: Examples from Toqabaqita texts and elicited data consistently show the SVO pattern in declarative sentences. This pattern is observed in natural speech and written forms, reinforcing the conclusion that SVO is the dominant order.

Manambu,"Manambu is a language spoken in the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Ndu family of languages. The dominant word order in Manambu is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Research and linguistic descriptions of Manambu, such as those by Alexandra Aikhenvald, indicate that the typical sentence structure in declarative sentences with both noun subjects and objects follows the SOV order. 
   - **Examples:** In documented examples of Manambu sentences, the subject typically precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end. For instance, a sentence like ""The man (S) the fish (O) caught (V)"" would be structured in Manambu as ""The man the fish caught.""
   - **Typological Consistency:** The SOV order is consistent with other languages in the region and within the Ndu language family, which also predominantly use the SOV structure.

Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Momu,"To determine the dominant word order in Momu, we need to examine the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This involves looking at the typical arrangement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in such sentences.

Based on available linguistic research and descriptions of Momu, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, the dominant word order is identified as SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of sentence structures in Momu, where the subject typically precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end of the sentence. This SOV pattern is consistent across various examples and contexts within the language.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptive grammars and linguistic studies on Momu indicate that the language predominantly follows an SOV order. This is evident in the majority of naturalistic sentence examples provided by native speakers and documented by linguists.
2. **Sentence Structure**: In declarative sentences, the subject noun phrase usually appears first, followed by the object noun phrase, and the verb is placed at the end. This structure is consistently observed in transitive sentences.
3. **Cross-Linguistic Patterns**: The SOV order is common among many languages in the region, and Momu aligns with this typological pattern. The consistency of this order in everyday usage further supports its classification as the dominant word order.

### Example:
Consider a simple transitive sentence in Momu:
- ""The man (S) the dog (O) saw (V).""

In Momu, this would typically be structured as:
- ""Man (S) dog (O) saw (V).""

This example illustrates the SOV order, where the subject ""man"" precedes the object ""dog,"" and the verb ""saw"" follows both.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Makasae,"Makasae is an Austronesian language spoken in East Timor. Based on linguistic research and analysis of the syntactic structure of Makasae, it has been observed that the dominant word order in declarative sentences, where both the subject and the object are nouns, is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Studies**: Various linguistic studies and fieldwork on Makasae have documented that the typical sentence structure follows the SOV pattern. This is consistent with many other languages in the region and within the Austronesian language family.
2. **Sentence Examples**: Analysis of sentence examples from Makasae texts and spoken language data shows a clear preference for placing the subject first, followed by the object, and then the verb. For instance, a typical sentence structure would be ""The man (S) the book (O) reads (V).""
3. **Typological Consistency**: The SOV order is common among languages that exhibit similar typological features to Makasae, such as agglutinative morphology and postpositional phrases.

### Conclusion:

Motuna,"Motuna, also known as Siwai, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. According to linguistic studies and typological data, Motuna exhibits a flexible word order, but there is a tendency towards a particular structure in declarative sentences when both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Motuna is known for its relatively free word order due to its rich morphological marking, which allows for flexibility in the arrangement of constituents.
   - Despite this flexibility, studies and linguistic descriptions of Motuna indicate a preference for the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order in declarative sentences.
   - This preference is observed in naturalistic data and elicited sentences, where SOV order tends to be the most frequently occurring structure.
   - The SOV order aligns with the typological tendencies of many Papuan languages, which often favor this word order.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Lavukaleve,"Lavukaleve is a language spoken in the Solomon Islands, and it belongs to the Central Solomons family. The word order in Lavukaleve is known to be quite flexible, and it does not adhere strictly to a single dominant order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. 

In Lavukaleve, the order of constituents can vary depending on pragmatic factors such as emphasis or focus. This flexibility means that no single word order can be identified as dominant. The language allows for multiple configurations of subject, object, and verb, and the choice among these configurations can be influenced by the context and the communicative needs of the speaker.

Given this flexibility and the lack of a consistently preferred order in declarative sentences, Lavukaleve does not have a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",sov,no dominant order
Dla (Menggwa),"To determine the dominant word order in the language Dla (Menggwa), we need to analyze the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This involves examining the relative positioning of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) within these sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Data:** According to linguistic studies and descriptions of the Dla (Menggwa) language, it has been observed that the typical sentence structure follows a pattern where the subject precedes the object, and the verb comes at the end of the sentence.
   - **Examples:** In various documented sentences, the subject (S) is placed at the beginning, followed by the object (O), and the verb (V) appears at the end. For instance, a sentence like ""The man (S) the dog (O) sees (V)"" would be structured as ""The man the dog sees"" in Dla (Menggwa).
   - **Cross-linguistic Comparison:** This pattern aligns with the SOV order, which is the most common word order globally, found in about half of the world's languages.

Given this consistent pattern in the syntactic structure of Dla (Menggwa), it is reasonable to conclude that the dominant word order is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Duna,"Duna is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. The dominant word order in Duna is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on linguistic studies and fieldwork that have analyzed the syntactic structure of Duna sentences. In declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns, the typical order observed is that the subject comes first, followed by the object, and the verb appears at the end.

### Reasoning:
1. **Field Studies and Descriptions**: Linguistic fieldwork conducted on Duna has consistently shown that the SOV order is prevalent in natural speech. Researchers have documented numerous examples of sentences that follow this pattern.
2. **Typological Consistency**: Duna's SOV order aligns with the typological characteristics of many other languages in the Trans-New Guinea family, which also predominantly use the SOV order.
3. **Sentence Structure**: Analysis of sentence structures in Duna reveals that the subject typically precedes the object, and the verb is placed at the end of the sentence. This structure is maintained across various contexts and sentence types, indicating a strong preference for SOV order.

### Example:
A typical Duna sentence might look like this:
- **Subject**: The man
- **Object**: The food
- **Verb**: Eats

In Duna, this would be structured as:
- The man (subject) the food (object) eats (verb).

### Conclusion:

Taulil,"To determine the dominant word order in Taulil, we need to examine the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This involves analyzing linguistic data from Taulil to see which order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) is most frequently used.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Data Analysis**:
   - If we have access to a corpus of Taulil sentences, we would look for patterns in sentences with clear subjects and objects.
   - For example, if we observe sentences like ""The man (S) the dog (O) sees (V)"" frequently, this would suggest an SOV order.
   - Conversely, if sentences like ""The man (S) sees (V) the dog (O)"" are more common, this would indicate an SVO order.

2. **Linguistic Descriptions**:
   - Descriptive grammars or linguistic studies on Taulil might provide insights into the typical sentence structure.
   - If linguistic descriptions consistently mention a particular word order as the default or most common, this would be a strong indicator of the dominant order.

3. **Cross-Linguistic Comparison**:
   - Comparing Taulil to related languages or languages in the same geographical area might provide additional clues, as languages in close contact or within the same language family often share typological features.

Based on available linguistic research and descriptions of Taulil, it has been observed that the language predominantly follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

### Conclusion:

Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Lower Sepik-Ramu family. It is known for its polysynthetic and highly inflected nature, which allows for a significant degree of flexibility in word order. In Yimas, the verb often carries extensive agreement morphology that includes information about the subject and object, which reduces the need for a fixed word order to convey grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Yimas exhibits a high degree of flexibility in the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. This flexibility is largely due to the rich inflectional morphology on the verb, which explicitly marks the roles of the subject and object.
   - Studies and linguistic descriptions of Yimas, such as those by linguist William Foley, indicate that while certain word orders might be more common in specific contexts, there is no single dominant word order that can be identified across all contexts.
   - The language allows for various permutations of S, O, and V, and the choice of word order can be influenced by pragmatic factors such as emphasis, focus, and topicalization rather than strict syntactic rules.

Given this high degree of flexibility and the lack of a single predominant order in natural discourse, it is appropriate to classify Yimas as having no dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
