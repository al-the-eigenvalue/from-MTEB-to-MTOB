Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Supyire can be determined by examining the structure of simple declarative sentences, particularly those involving both a subject and a direct object. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the structure of simple clauses and mentions that verbal clauses typically have the order: **SUBJECT – TENSE-ASPECT-MODALITY (TAM) – DIRECT OBJECT – VERB**. This suggests that the direct object precedes the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of verbal clauses with various constituents. The example with a direct object is: ""Unmha suroshwoho"" (She HAB mush cook), where ""Unmha"" is the subject, ""suroshwoho"" is the verb, and ""mush"" is the direct object. This follows the pattern **SUBJECT – TAM – DIRECT OBJECT – VERB**.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Reiterates that the basic word order in simple clauses is **subject—predicate**. The subject typically precedes the verb, and the direct object precedes the verb as well.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions that in Supyire, the direct object precedes the verb, but all indirect objects follow it. This further supports the **S – O – V** structure.

5. **Paragraph 7**: Provides an example of a sentence with a serial verb construction: ""Κά ml1 / ιήρά u ni-zini-qi ta... mobfligitaän"" (I came and found him lying beside the car), where the structure is consistent with the subject preceding the verb and the object preceding the verb.

6. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses questioning in serial verb constructions and provides examples where the direct object precedes the verb, such as in ""Jlähä u a lwb a kärd pyenga ye?"" (What did s/he take home?), where ""Jlähä"" (what) is the direct object, ""u"" (s/he) is the subject, and ""a lwb a kärd"" (take home) is the verb phrase.

7. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses grammaticalized verbs in serial constructions but does not contradict the observed **SOV** pattern.

8. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses focus constructions and provides examples where the subject and direct object precede the verb, such as in ""Jö u a kü itbd ye?"" (Who killed it?), where ""Jö"" (who) is the subject, ""u"" (s/he) is the subject pronoun, and ""kü itbd"" (killed it) is the verb phrase.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Supyire is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Jamsay,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order of the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly states that ""The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.""
   - This ordering is common even when the subject is a pronoun.
   - The object is described as the inner (immediately preverbal) argument, and the subject as the outer argument.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The regular ordering pattern in main clauses is described as ""Adv-SNP-X-V,"" where ""SNP"" stands for nonpronominal subject, and ""X"" includes nonpronominal dative, object, and adverbials.
   - Example (14.b) illustrates subject-object-verb ordering with nonpronominal NPs: ""ti -$ ta@˘ jç$Nç@ ko$˘-Ø"" (The hyena ate the hare).

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - It mentions that ""Most if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.""
   - This reinforces the SOV order as a characteristic of Jamsay.

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - It provides an example of a relative clause with the structure ""place.L 2SgO 1SgS.L see.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh,"" which translates to ""the place where I saw you."" This follows the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Example (22.b) shows the sentence ""ni N $ i $r<e$ a$nsa@˘ra@-n mi $ E^˘-Ø"" (the day when I saw the white person), which follows the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - It describes the ""before"" construction, which also follows the SOV order: ""[mi $ de^˘] ma$ [a@ra@ ma$ sa@˘ku$] jE@˘rE@-wE$ le$"" (before my father brings the sack of rice).

7. **Paragraph 14**:
   - It provides examples of relative clauses with the structure ""di ˘$ < u@ mi $ E^˘-Ø"" (the place where I saw you), following the SOV order.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Jamsay is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by multiple explicit statements and examples throughout the provided paragraphs, consistently indicating that the subject precedes the object, which in turn precedes the verb in declarative sentences.",sov,sov
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, I will analyze the information to determine the dominant word order.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph mentions that the 'Burulo dialect of Ma'di is SVO, while the Lokai dialect is partly SVO and partly SOV. This indicates that there is some variability in word order across dialects, but SVO is at least a significant pattern.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (5) shows the structure ""maeßlpara IS fish N-eat AFF"" which translates to ""I will certainly eat fish."" This suggests an SVO order (Subject-Verb-Object).

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph discusses the possibility of objects being left-dislocated before the verb, which implies that the typical order might be SVO, but objects can be fronted for emphasis or other pragmatic reasons.

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example (1) ""ká gbándá pä 3S cassava N-eat"" translates to ""He is eating cassava,"" which again suggests an SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - It is stated that in the 'Burulo dialect, the object never precedes the inflected verb, reinforcing the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 17**:
   - This paragraph mentions that Lokai can have object-verb order, but this seems to be a dialectal variation rather than the dominant pattern.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the dominant word order in Ma'di appears to be **SVO**. This is supported by multiple examples and explicit statements about the word order in different dialects, with SVO being a common pattern.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Bangime,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, the dominant word order in the language can be determined by examining the frequency and context of the different word orders mentioned.

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph states that the attested word orders in Bangime are SVO, SOV, and OSV for untopicalized sentences. It mentions that incompletive aspects are usually SVO, completive aspects are SOV, and the future can be expressed with OSV word order. This indicates that different word orders are used depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the phrase.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates that the incompletive categories are usually in SOV order, the completed categories are SVO, and the future tense may be either SOV or OSV. It also mentions that some verbs may deviate from the default word order to indicate topicalization.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the irrealis mood, which has SVO word order. It also mentions that the incompletive aspects follow the word order S-AUX-O-V, which is a variation of SOV.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of incompletive sentences with SOV word order and mentions that the default word order for an incompletive clause with an object is SOV.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in the completive aspect with SVO word order and mentions that the verb ‘take’ may only appear with SVO word order in the completive aspect.

6. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the subjunctive and imperative moods, which also follow SOV word order.

7. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in the completive, perfective, and perfect aspects, all of which have SVO word order.

8. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph reiterates that the perfective aspect is normally formed with SVO word order and provides examples of sentences with SVO word order.

9. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the passive construction, which uses OSV word order.

10. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the future tense, which can be formed with OSV word order.

11. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph mentions that in an incompletive clause with an object, the default word order is subject-object-verb (SOV).

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided, it is clear that Bangime exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order, with different orders being used depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the sentence. The language uses SVO, SOV, and OSV word orders in different contexts, and no single word order appears to be dominant across all contexts. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Bangime's word order is ""No dominant order.""

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Gumuz as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph explicitly mentions that transitive constituent order in Gumuz varies between AVP (SVO) and APV (SOV). It also lists other possible orders such as PVA (OVS), VAP (VSO), and VPA (VOS).
   - Examples provided include:
     - (10.71) AVP (SVO): ""The child rolled the tire.""
     - (10.72) AVP (SVO): ""The donkey ate the grass.""
     - (10.73) APV (SOV): ""He found salt.""
     - (10.74) APV (SOV): ""The woman raised her child.""
     - (10.75) PVA (OVS): ""The fire consumed the house.""
     - (10.76) PVA (OVS): ""The wind broke the tree.""
     - (10.77) VAP (VSO): ""And he took my child.""

2. **Paragraph 9**:
   - This paragraph mentions that the more typical word order in Gumuz main clauses is AVO (SVO).

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Example (12.50a) shows AVO (SVO) order: ""The person hit the woman.""

4. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example (12.51) shows AVO (SVO) order: ""The one who hit the chair is Bamita.""

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that while Gumuz allows multiple word orders, the SVO (AVP) order appears frequently and is noted as typical in main clauses. This suggests that SVO is the dominant word order in Gumuz.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object). This is further illustrated with examples showing the subject NP followed by the verb and then the object NP.
2. **Paragraph 4** reinforces this by providing examples where the subject NP precedes the verb, and the direct object NP follows the verb.
3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that the distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order, with subject NPs preceding the verb and direct objects following it.
4. **Paragraph 19** also supports this by stating that Koyra Chiini shows S-MAN-V-X constituent order, where the direct object follows the verb.

These paragraphs consistently describe and exemplify an SVO word order, indicating that this is the dominant word order in Koyra Chiini.

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple paragraphs explicitly describe the SVO order as the basic or typical sentence structure.
- Examples provided in these paragraphs consistently follow the SVO pattern.
- The grammar does not suggest significant variation or flexibility that would indicate a lack of a dominant order.

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Seme,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in the language Seme can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses OV word order in Siamou, indicating that VO word order is not permitted and presenting an example of SOV order.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Explicitly states that the basic word order of Siamou clauses is S (Particle) O V.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that head-final order (SOV) is the most prevalent surface order in Siamou.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses SVO characteristics in Kru languages but notes that Siamou has exclusive SOV word order.
5. **Paragraph 8**: Reiterates that Siamou sentences always have surface SOV word order.
6. **Paragraph 9**: Confirms that Siamou does not display any alternation in word order and consistently has S (Part) OV word order.
7. **Paragraph 14**: States that Siamou consistently has SOV word order, even though most clauses have some kind of particle.
8. **Paragraph 18**: Summarizes that Siamou has properties consistent with SOV languages, including SOV word order.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Siamou (and by extension, Seme, if they are the same or closely related languages) is consistently SOV. This conclusion is supported by multiple explicit statements and examples provided in the grammar.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Tima,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Tima can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 2** mentions that the word order concerning a specific type of passive is SVO.
   - **Paragraph 6** explicitly states that the active word order of the sentence in Tima is SVO.
   - **Paragraph 7** provides an example where the word order is SVO: ""uŋ-k-umun-dʌy-ana"" (I found/saw cows).
   - **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 13** discuss the placement of pronominal markers and object markers in relation to the verb, which indirectly supports the SVO structure by showing the typical positions of subjects and objects around the verb.
   - **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 8** discuss the verb structure and head-marking characteristics of Tima, but do not directly address the dominant word order.

The consistent mention of SVO order in active sentences and the examples provided support the conclusion that SVO is the dominant word order in Tima.

2. **Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and descriptions given.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the SOV order explicitly: ""There are various alternative word orders, in particular subject—object—verb (SOV; see be-229The clauseW24.ha ma di (a) mi ké Nl TOP teach -T IsG TR ‘He teaches me the !Xun language.’""

2. **Paragraph 2** provides a table indicating that the basic word order is SVO: ""As table 7-1 shows, the basic word order is subject—verb—object (SVO), irrespective of whether pronominal or nominal participants are involved.""

3. **Paragraph 3** states that while the basic word order is SVO, there is also an SOV structure: ""While the basic word order is SVO, there is a second word order structure in all dialects, namely SOV, when specific matrix verbs taking either nominal or verbal complements are involved.""

4. **Paragraph 4** emphasizes the importance of word order for case differentiation and mentions that some verbs allow for a reversal of subject and complement: ""Since there are no case inflections, word order is important for case differentiation. Still, in many instances, case functions are marked neither by word order nor by any other formal means but have to be derived from the semantic context of the utterance.""

5. **Paragraph 7** indicates that the object follows the verb: ""What is common to all dialects is that TAM (tense—aspect-modality) markers and negation are placed between subject and verb, that the object follows the verb, and that the question marker is placed before the verb phrase.""

6. **Paragraph 11** mentions the SOV construction explicitly: ""Kohler (1973: 63) says that when transitive verbs are used in E2, the object is expressed even if this is not required by the context, as in the following example: = nllé6(-a) teach ‘[He] lied to him [the hyena] and [the hyena] just stood there.’""

7. **Paragraph 15** provides an example of SOV order: ""Subject to the SOV word order constraint, e.g., WImf. Isc-PRG stay-a ‘I stay at home.’ (Heikkinen 1987: 50)""

8. **Paragraph 19** discusses the serialization of verbs and indicates that the object follows the verb: ""The two verbs may not be separately marked for tense—aspect, nor may they take separate adverbial modifiers.""

From the analysis, it is clear that both SVO and SOV orders are mentioned frequently. However, the grammar explicitly states that the basic word order is SVO, and SOV appears to be used in specific contexts, particularly with certain matrix verbs and in narrative discourse.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Katcha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Katcha, we can derive the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""That it is left on the external argument node reflects the fact that Katcha basic word order is either SVO or VSO."" This indicates that Katcha primarily uses either SVO or VSO word order.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses passive constructions but does not provide direct evidence about the dominant word order in active declarative sentences.

3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 4** focus on case markers and relative clauses, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss locative adverbs and pronouns, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss verb extensions and applicatives, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss theoretical analyses and nominal modifiers, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** discuss applicatives and verb extensions, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

8. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** discuss verb extensions and applicatives, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

9. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss relative clauses and nominal modifiers, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

10. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss relative clauses and applicatives, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

11. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss verb extensions and nominal modifiers, respectively, without providing direct evidence about the dominant word order.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 1 that Katcha's basic word order is either SVO or VSO, and the lack of contradictory evidence in the other paragraphs, we can conclude that Katcha has a dominant word order of either SVO or VSO.

### Conclusion:
SVO or VSO",no dominant order,svo
Ijo (Kolokuma),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ijo (Kolokuma), the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here is the analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Examples like ""t o b q dii"" (child look) and ""t o b y wenj-mQ"" (child walk D) show the verb following the noun, but these are intransitive sentences.
   - Transitive example: ""ay6 bara-ki akj, ddma tun"" (new way em1 take song sing) translates to ""sing a song in a new way,"" showing the verb ""sing"" following the object ""song.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Examples like ""y6 gba-nj,l y-pjrj"" (thing say him give) and ""dbma tun-ni, a-pjri"" (song sing her give) show the structure where the verb follows the object, indicating an SOV pattern.
   - ""egberi gbi-ni, y-pjr/"" (story say him give) translates to ""tell him a story,"" showing the verb ""say"" following the object ""story.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples like ""eri, b6-mi"" (he come Spa) and ""eri, am6 dbo, b6-mi"" (he came through the town) are intransitive and do not provide information on the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive sentences.

    - This paragraph discusses numeral adjustments and does not provide clear examples of basic declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - This paragraph discusses transformations and does not provide clear examples of basic declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - This paragraph discusses pronouns and does not provide clear examples of basic declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

16. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Example: ""omtnj, ken[ 6b6ri toboy erj-mj"" (they a goat child see Spa) translates to ""they saw a young goat,"" showing the verb ""see"" following the object ""child,"" indicating an SOV pattern.

17. **Paragraph 17**:
    - This paragraph discusses numeral transformations and does not provide clear examples of basic declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

18. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Example: ""irap, ingo deri, pit$-mj"" (she trap weave set Spa) translates to ""she wove a trap and then set it,"" showing the verb ""set"" following the object ""trap,"" indicating an SOV pattern.

19. **Paragraph 19**:
    - This paragraph discusses the introduction of ""akjz 'USE'"" and does not provide clear examples of basic declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

**Reasoning**:
The examples provided in the relevant paragraphs consistently show the verb following the object in transitive sentences, indicating an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.

**Conclusion**:
SOV",sov,sov
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 17** are particularly relevant:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example sentence: ""ólí ómòhè é ólí émàè.""
   - Translation: ""The man has eaten the food.""
   - Structure: Subject (ólí ómòhè) - Verb (é) - Object (ólí émàè)

2. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example sentence: ""ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.""
   - Translation: ""He killed the rat, that is the man.""
   - Structure: Subject (ó) - Verb (gbé') - Object (ólí ófè)

Both examples clearly show the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, the dominant word order in the language can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses. It also mentions that SVO order is restricted to subordinate clauses. Examples provided in the paragraph, such as:

   - (31) Atsʼa ŋoka oka. (VAO - ""The dog gnaws a bone."")
   - (32) Epa bee ŋok. (VS - ""The dog slept (yesterday)."")
   - (33) Atsʼa noo ŋoka oka. (VAO - ""The dog gnawed the bone (a while ago)."")
   
   These examples clearly show the verb preceding the subject and object in main clauses, confirming the VSO order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses subordinate clauses, noting that they have an SVO constituent order. However, it reiterates that the basic unmarked main clauses retain the VSO order. Examples such as:
   - (75) Na soreima ceyoo poposaa... (VSO - ""If a boy kills a lizard,..."")
   - (76) Noo ŋokia epad,... (SV - ""When the dog was sleeping,..."")
   - (77) Noo ŋokia atsʼee okak,... (AVO - ""When the dog gnawed the bone,..."")
   
   These examples further support the VSO order in main clauses.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides additional examples of subordinate clauses with SVO order but confirms that main clauses retain the VSO order:
   - (78) Hyeiyaa toimena epa ŋok. (VSO - ""I know that the dog is sleeping."")
   - (79) Hyeiyaa toimena atsʼa ŋoka oka. (VSO - ""I know that the dog is gnawing the bone."")

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses auxiliary verbs and notes that auxiliarized clauses also follow the same order found in subordinate clauses, which is SVO. However, it does not contradict the VSO order in main clauses.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph mentions that temporal subordinate clauses have the form of a relative clause and exhibit SVO order. It does not provide new information about the order in main clauses.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses case marking and provides examples of transitive clauses with third-person subjects, showing the accusative marking on objects. It does not contradict the VSO order in main clauses.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides an overview of the case system and confirms that subjects of indicative clauses always bear the nominative case, with examples supporting the VSO order.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses verbs and their inflectional affixes but does not provide new information about word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses noun compounding and does not provide new information about word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the sequential impersonal passive and provides examples of VSO order in main clauses:
    - (17) Naa iryametanie gwasak,... (VSO - ""When a stone is gotten,..."")
    - (18) Ceesa ntsa riyek. (VSO - ""He flushed out an animal (from a thicket)."")

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides a typological overview and confirms that the basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO (VS/VAO).

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses cleft constructions and does not provide new information about word order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses relative clause structure and confirms that the order of constituents in a main clause is VS or VAO.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the solicitive intonation pattern and does not provide new information about word order.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Paragraph 2** mentions that in the Perfective Present, Ngiti has SVO word order.
   - **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 12** describe constructions where the object precedes the nominalized verb stem and an auxiliary follows the subject, resulting in SAuxOV order. However, this is a specific construction and not indicative of the general word order.
   - **Paragraph 16** provides examples of sentences with the verb ""to be"" and shows SVO order in declarative sentences.
   - **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss pronouns and clitics but do not contradict the SVO order mentioned earlier.

The evidence from the paragraphs indicates that the SVO order is used in declarative sentences, particularly in the Perfective Present tense, which suggests it is the dominant word order.

2. **Conclusion**: SVO",no dominant order,svo
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the word order is predominantly SOV when the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words. It also mentions that OSV order is possible but used only when the subject is in focus, indicating that SOV is the neutral and more common order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** confirms that the basic word order is SOV.
   
3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the flexibility of constituent order in benefactive constructions but emphasizes that the verb remains final, supporting the SOV structure.
   
4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, consistent with SOV order.
   
5. **Paragraph 5** includes examples where the verb is final, further supporting the SOV order.
   
6. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the order of dative NP and subject NP can sometimes be inverted, but this does not affect the verb-final nature of the sentences, consistent with SOV.
   
7. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** do not provide direct evidence about the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive clauses.
   
8. **Paragraph 9** discusses the flexibility of adverbial positions but does not contradict the SOV order for the main constituents.
   
9. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** provide examples and discussions that are consistent with SOV order.
   
10. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** do not provide direct evidence about the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive clauses.
   
11. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss possession and other constructions but do not contradict the SOV order.
   
12. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss grammatical relations and adjective-noun order but do not contradict the SOV order.
   
13. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss suffix order and other morphological aspects but do not contradict the SOV order.
   
14. **Paragraph 20** provides examples where the verb is final, consistent with SOV order.

Given the consistent emphasis on the verb-final structure and the explicit statements about SOV being the basic and predominant order, it is clear that the dominant word order in Sidaama is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structures and the examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Mursi utilizes a canonical constituent order AVO/SV and a non-canonical OVA/VS order. This suggests that the language has multiple word orders depending on the context, but it does not specify which is dominant.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the use of case markers and the pragmatic roles of pronouns in different constituent orders. It mentions that the AVO order is often used for topical constituents, while the OVA order is used for focused constituents. This indicates flexibility in word order but does not establish a dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of sentences in different orders, including AVO and OVA. The examples show that both orders are used, but it does not indicate which is more frequent or dominant.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the canonical order AVO/SV and provides examples of intransitive and transitive clauses. It states that AVO/SV is the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses uttered in isolation, suggesting that AVO/SV might be the dominant order.

5. **Paragraph 5** reiterates that AVO/SV is the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses uttered in isolation, reinforcing the idea that AVO/SV is the dominant order.

6. **Paragraph 6** provides more examples of AVO constituent order in monotransitive clauses, further supporting the dominance of AVO/SV order.

7. **Paragraph 7** discusses the non-canonical OVA/VS order and its use in specific contexts, such as marking nominative case and avoiding argument ambiguity. This indicates that OVA/VS is used but does not suggest it is the dominant order.

8. **Paragraph 8** provides examples of passive constructions and the use of nominative pronouns in non-canonical orders, indicating flexibility in word order but not dominance.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses the use of interrogative words and their positions in sentences, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order of declarative sentences.

10. **Paragraph 10** provides a linguistic profile of Mursi, mentioning that it has a canonical constituent order AVO/SV and other orders depending on clause types and pragmatic context. This suggests that AVO/SV is the default or dominant order.

11. **Paragraph 11** discusses the structure of Mursi nouns and their morphological categories, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

12. **Paragraph 12** discusses the use of object pronominal suffixes and their co-occurrence with subject suffixes, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses the phonological and morphological properties of Mursi words, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

14. **Paragraph 14** discusses nominative case marking on pronouns and the agreement of verbs with post-verbal nominative pronouns, indicating flexibility in word order but not dominance.

15. **Paragraph 15** provides examples of canonical and non-canonical orders, reinforcing the idea that AVO/SV is the most frequently found order.

16. **Paragraph 16** discusses content questions and the positions of interrogative words, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order of declarative sentences.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses the morphological categories of nouns and their syntactic functions, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

18. **Paragraph 18** discusses the syntactic functions of noun subclasses, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

19. **Paragraph 19** provides examples of noun modification constructions and the use of deictic elements, which does not directly relate to the dominant word order.

20. **Paragraph 20** provides examples of passive constructions and the use of nominative pronouns, indicating flexibility in word order but not dominance.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Mursi is **AVO/SV**.

### Conclusion: AVO/SV",svo,not mentioned in the grammar
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Majang by examining the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the VAP (Verb-Agent-Patient) order, which corresponds to VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) in the context of Majang. It mentions that attempts to elicit other word orders did not produce variants and that VAP has a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that in a Majang clause where the constituents A (agent), verb, and P (patient) are overtly expressed, they frequently appear in the order Verb – Subject – Object (VSO). It also provides examples showing this order and mentions that VAP (VSO) is invariably the order of constituents when eliciting transitive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that VAP (VSO) is a very infrequent constituent structure in natural discourse but is the default in elicited sentences.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph confirms that the canonical order in Majang is VAP (VSO).

5. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph states that the basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP (VSO), where A stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent, usually the object.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Majang is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object). This order is consistently mentioned as the basic or canonical order in both elicited and natural discourse, although it is less frequent in natural texts due to pragmatic factors.

### Conclusion:
VSO",vso,vso
Birri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Birri, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions a construction where the object precedes the verb, which suggests an OV order.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of sentences with the structure ""subject + verb + object"" (e.g., ""mu-ru ma (a)ndd"" for ""you are me seeing""), indicating an SVO order.
3. **Paragraph 6** describes imperative constructions where the verb precedes the object (e.g., ""Beat the child me yoo-ngu""), suggesting a VO order.
4. **Paragraph 9** includes examples of infinitive constructions where the object precedes the verb (e.g., ""object + g(a) + verb""), indicating an OV order.
5. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of sentences with the structure ""subject + verb + object"" (e.g., ""He brought a big tree ana re kpi ukama""), indicating an SVO order.
6. **Paragraph 19** shows examples of sentences with the structure ""subject + verb + object"" (e.g., ""Sing. 1. amd aviri I am Birri""), indicating an SVO order.
7. **Paragraph 20** includes examples of sentences with the structure ""subject + verb + object"" (e.g., ""I drank water mdyd-ngi wu""), indicating an SVO order.

The evidence from the paragraphs suggests that while there are instances of OV order, the predominant pattern in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is SVO. This is supported by multiple examples in the provided text.

### Reasoning:
- **SVO Order**: Multiple paragraphs (5, 14, 19, 20) provide clear examples of SVO order in declarative sentences.
- **OV Order**: Some paragraphs (1, 9) suggest an OV order, but these are less frequent and often appear in specific constructions (e.g., infinitive).

Given the frequency and clarity of SVO examples in declarative sentences, it is reasonable to conclude that the dominant word order in Birri is SVO.

### Conclusion:
SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Tamashek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can analyze the word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example: ""i-la-\faell-l aslhaeqq"" translates to ""It (=animal) has a right on me."" Here, ""i-la"" (verb) precedes the subject ""aslhaeqq"" (right) and the object ""l"" (me).
   - Example: ""i-tatt maesseku"" translates to ""He eats sweet potato."" Here, ""i-tatt"" (verb) precedes the subject ""he"" and the object ""maesseku"" (sweet potato).

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example: ""t-3nhasy-\taen"" translates to ""The woman saw them."" Here, ""t-3nhasy"" (verb) precedes the subject ""woman"" and the object ""them.""

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example: ""i-tdtt i-sdss"" translates to ""He eats and drinks."" Here, ""i-tdtt"" (verb) and ""i-sdss"" (verb) precede the subject ""he.""

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example: ""i-ll-\e udi a-\dar-3s-\t n-asj Yds"" translates to ""But there is some butter; that [focus] is what we'll just put in it (=food)."" Here, ""i-ll"" (verb) precedes the subject ""butter"" and the object ""it.""

5. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example: ""i-faelAad baemasko"" translates to ""He left Bamako."" Here, ""i-faelAad"" (verb) precedes the subject ""he"" and the object ""Bamako.""

6. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example: ""i-ss-anta e-wet"" translates to ""Rain began to strike (=fall)."" Here, ""i-ss-anta"" (verb) precedes the subject ""rain"" and the object ""strike.""

From these examples, it is evident that the verb consistently precedes both the subject and the object in declarative sentences. This indicates a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order.

### Conclusion:
VSO",vso,vso
Coptic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Coptic, several key points indicate the dominant word order of the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""S-V-O order can be established as the basic word order on syntactic grounds,"" and provides examples such as ""a brother (oy-con) asked (a ... xne) Apa Sarapion."" It also mentions that Coptic is a head-initial language where the verb precedes the direct and indirect objects, and the subject precedes the direct object.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Reiterates that ""S-V-O order can be established as the basic word order on syntactic grounds,"" and provides another example supporting this structure.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses that ""S-V-O is the order which arises in pragmatically neutral contexts,"" providing examples such as ""his (Apa Mena’s) sister (req-cwne) (a... wa) his bones (N-Neq-Keec).""

4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that Coptic has relatively flexible word order but identifies S-V-O as the canonical order, especially in pragmatically neutral contexts.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Again, it is mentioned that Coptic permits several arrangements of the main constituents but classifies it as a discourse-configurational language where the canonical order is S-V-O.

6. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses subject inversion and other marked constructions but implies that these are deviations from the canonical S-V-O order.

7. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions that subject inversion is used for focus, yielding V-O-S order, but this is a marked construction, not the basic word order.

8. **Paragraph 15**: Provides examples of basic word order (S-V-O) and discusses left-dislocation and subject inversion as marked constructions.

9. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the use of V-O-S order in specific contexts (focus, presentational constructions), indicating that these are not the default structures.

### Conclusion:
Based on the consistent references to S-V-O as the basic or canonical word order in pragmatically neutral contexts and the examples provided, it is clear that the dominant word order in Coptic is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences and the placement of subjects, verbs, and objects.

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of verbs and their objects, such as ""Nryòn (AT Nrònó) ínû"" (I know thing) and ""îká (OK îkà) mún"" (He brought water). In these examples, the subject (S) precedes the verb (V), and the object (O) follows the verb, indicating an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the structure of sentences, indicating that the verb is the head of the verb phrase (VP) and dominates the direct object and indirect object. The structure suggests that the verb follows the subject and precedes the object, supporting an SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: The schematic representation of sentence structure shows the subject (NP) followed by the verb (V) and then the object (NP), reinforcing the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the argument structure of verbs, indicating that transitive verbs take both a subject NP and a direct object NP. The examples provided, such as ""Àdazùtàràakwà"" (Ada bought a cloth) and ""ÀdazùtààràChikeakwà"" (Ada bought the cloth for Chike), follow the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides examples of complex verbs and their complements, such as ""wèru anya àlà"" and ""zugbu mmadù n’ohī"". These examples also follow the SVO order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Igbo is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object).

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Mambai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Mambai by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 2** is particularly relevant as it explicitly discusses the constituent order in Mambai. It states that the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly SVO (subject–verb–object). This is supported by examples provided in the text:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```
   tí4gérêm %á%4zí túrà
   AUG-woman:PL sow:PFV-PL millet
   S V O
   ""The women sowed millet""
   ```

2. **Example 2:**
   ```
   mìí yáh pìzá
   1SG:IRR take:FUT horse
   S V O
   ""I will take the horse""
   ```

These examples clearly show the subject preceding the verb, which in turn precedes the object, confirming the SVO order.

Furthermore, the paragraph mentions that in verbal clauses with two objects, the more salient object in the discourse follows the other object, but this does not affect the primary SVO structure. Additional examples and explanations in the paragraph reinforce the SVO order as the dominant structure.

Other paragraphs provided do not contradict this finding and mostly focus on other aspects of the language, such as verb morphology, suffixes, and auxiliary constructions, without providing conflicting information about the basic word order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Ingessana,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingessana, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (1) shows the sentence: ""The youth leader bought the food for the grandfather.""
     - Subject: mɛ̀ɛn̄ (youth leader)
     - Verb: māār-sá (bought)
     - Object: nāms-á (food)
   - This sentence follows the SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (34) compares verb and adjective syntax:
     - ""The person chops"" (ɟɛ̄n kɔ́m)
     - Subject: ɟɛ̄n (the person)
     - Verb: kɔ́m (chops)
   - This sentence also follows the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (4) states: ""The Baggara were kidnapping young girls.""
     - Subject: bāárg-á (Baggara)
     - Verb: ŋáɔ́-a᷄ ǹ (were kidnapping)
     - Object: ɲā-lg (young girls)
   - This sentence follows the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (8) shows a transitive sentence: ""Jader led his very large group.""
     - Subject: ɟād̪ɛɛ̀ r̀ =ā (Jader)
     - Verb: wár-sá (led)
     - Object: kāŋ (group)
   - This sentence follows the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example (2a) shows: ""I buried the egg.""
     - Subject: á (I)
     - Verb: d̪ùr-sù (buried)
     - Object: kɔ́lɔ́d=̪ ɔ́ (the egg)
   - This sentence follows the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 17**:
   - It mentions that ""As expected in an SVO language, subject pronouns are pre-verbal and object and dative pronouns are post-verbal.""
   - This explicitly states that Ingessana is an SVO language.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ingessana is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Gorowa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gorowa, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""SOV word order is common enough to be considered canonical,"" but also notes that Gorowa nouns may appear in any order relative to each other and the verb, indicating some flexibility.
   
2. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that the basic constituent order in pragmatically neutral clauses is ""Subj. Obj. Sel V,"" which translates to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

3. **Paragraph 7** provides an example of a pragmatically unmarked phrase where the subject noun occurs clause-initially, followed by the object and then the verb: ""garma baahaa ngina taáhh"" (The boy hit the hyaena), which is SOV.

4. **Paragraph 15** further supports the SOV order with examples of direct object positioning relative to the verb and selector, showing that the object typically precedes the verb.

5. **Paragraph 18** reiterates that SOV word order is canonical in Gorowa.

While there are instances of other word orders (e.g., OSV, VS, VO) mentioned in the text, the consistent reference to SOV as the canonical or basic order in pragmatically neutral clauses suggests that SOV is the dominant word order in Gorowa.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Shatt,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Shatt language, I will analyze the relevant information to determine the dominant word order.

### Analysis:

#### Paragraph 1:
- ""käꞌdoc käzäkeyza tä pang Osox. ‘She went and reported (something) to Lion’""
  - This sentence does not provide a clear example of a transitive clause with both subject and object as nouns.

#### Paragraph 3:
- ""Kig kasax op. Person refused the young man.""
  - This sentence follows the SVO order: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasax) - Object (op).

#### Paragraph 5:
- ""Na kala apoco kox Nyaxolow poko päxä deny. Then Hare saw Hyena carrying the calf.""
  - This sentence follows the SVO order: Subject (Na kala apoco kox Nyaxolow) - Verb (poko) - Object (päxä deny).

#### Paragraph 10:
- ""Kig kasiy ya. Person ate meat.""
  - This sentence follows the SVO order: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasiy) - Object (ya).

#### Paragraph 17:
- ""Kig kasiy ya. Person ate meat.""
  - This sentence repeats the SVO order: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasiy) - Object (ya).

#### Paragraph 18:
- ""Kig togada deny. Person gives calf.""
  - This sentence follows the SVO order: Subject (Kig) - Verb (togada) - Object (deny).

### Reasoning:
The examples provided consistently show the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. This pattern is observed in multiple instances across different paragraphs, indicating a dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information regarding the word order in Koromfe:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the subject NP is positioned before the verb in intransitive verbs and that there is no difference in the positioning of the subject NP in transitive verbs.
2. **Paragraph 4** states that the direct object NP is positioned after the verb.
3. **Paragraph 6** indicates that Koromfe sentences require a subject, but other verb arguments can be omitted. The order of the constituents for the combination of verb, subject, and direct object is given in the relevant sections.
4. **Paragraph 13** mentions that the indirect object NP is positioned after the verb.
5. **Paragraph 14** provides an example where the verb ""give"" is used, and the order of constituents is verb-object-indirect object, with the possibility of the indirect object being expressed with a postposition.
6. **Paragraph 15** describes the order of constituents in copular sentences, where the subject usually precedes the copula, and the complement follows it.
7. **Paragraph 16** states that word order is used to distinguish the NP arguments of the verb; in a simple non-emphasized sentence, the subject NP precedes the verb, and the object NPs follow the verb.

From these observations, it is clear that the typical order in declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns is:

- **Subject (S) precedes the Verb (V)**
- **Verb (V) precedes the Object (O)**

This indicates that the dominant word order in Koromfe is **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Nobiin,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Nobiin by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are some key observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""then the woman who served the boy said to him""
     - Structure: [the woman] (S) [the boy] (O) [served] (V)
     - This example shows an SOV order.
   - Example: ""look, the tree which you cursed has withered""
     - Structure: [you] (S) [the tree] (O) [cursed] (V)
     - This example also shows an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""he buries him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock""
     - Structure: [he] (S) [him] (O) [buries] (V)
     - This example shows an SVO order.
   - Example: ""and he looked around to the woman who had done this""
     - Structure: [he] (S) [the woman] (O) [looked around] (V)
     - This example shows an SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Example: ""the teacher, coming, calls you""
     - Structure: [the teacher] (S) [you] (O) [calls] (V)
     - This example shows an SVO order.
   - Example: ""my daughter Miskine is coming""
     - Structure: [my daughter Miskine] (S) [is coming] (V)
     - This example shows an SV order (intransitive).

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example: ""the man who says the word""
     - Structure: [the man] (S) [the word] (O) [says] (V)
     - This example shows an SOV order.
   - Example: ""the word, which the man said""
     - Structure: [the man] (S) [the word] (O) [said] (V)
     - This example shows an SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example: ""the girl brought her father a small fire""
     - Structure: [the girl] (S) [a small fire] (O) [brought] (V)
     - This example shows an SVO order.

From these examples, we observe that both SOV and SVO orders are present in Nobiin. However, SOV appears more frequently in the examples provided, especially in more complex sentences and relative clauses. This suggests that while SVO is also used, SOV might be the more dominant or neutral order in declarative sentences involving nouns as subjects and objects.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Nyimang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information to determine the dominant word order in Nyimang. Here are the key observations:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the placement of particles in relation to the verb and subject, but it does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

2. **Paragraph 3** provides several examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns:
   - ""gil doso ka tam"" (the dog is eating food)
   - ""kwedile ka fidsij"" (the salt is finished)
   - ""a gilo a wen"" (I see a dog)
   - ""a lli>u twil"" (I am drinking water)
   - ""kwonn ls\""1S"" (cook the meat)
   - ""en a eloo twen"" (he is bringing milk)
   - ""sn a miro ka tushe"" (she has lit the fire)
   - ""wadaI,J timi:l:.o. tows"" (the man is making a wattle door)

   From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
   - ""gil doso ka tam"" (SOV)
   - ""a gilo a wen"" (SOV)
   - ""a lli>u twil"" (SOV)
   - ""kwonn ls\""1S"" (SOV)
   - ""en a eloo twen"" (SOV)
   - ""sn a miro ka tushe"" (SOV)
   - ""wadaI,J timi:l:.o. tows"" (SOV)

   The consistent pattern here is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

3. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 8** provide additional examples that reinforce the SOV pattern:
   - ""a bar a wen"" (I see a cow)
   - ""a bar a wenden"" (I see two cows)
   - ""a bar a wendi"" (I see cows)

   These examples also follow the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** discuss verb forms and suffixes but do not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

5. **Paragraph 19** provides additional examples of verb usage but does not contradict the SOV pattern observed in previous paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided examples and analysis, the dominant word order in Nyimang is **SOV**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Lamé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Lamé can be determined by examining the relative positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences, particularly in transitive clauses where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""A direct object noun immediately follows the verb.""
   - ""In the perfective/subjunctive clause the direct object pronoun follows the verb (SVO)...""
   - ""In the non-perfective clause, the direct object pronoun follows the tense/aspect marker and precedes the verb (S Tense/Aspect O V).""
   - This indicates that in perfective/subjunctive clauses, the order is SVO.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""SVO"" is mentioned multiple times in the context of perfective/subjunctive clauses.
   - ""S (Tense/Aspect) O V"" is mentioned for non-perfective clauses.
   - This reinforces the SVO order in perfective/subjunctive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""In the perfective clause, the indirect object can be marked by position alone, provided it immediately follows the verb and is immediately followed by a nominal direct object.""
   - ""The position between subject and verb serves as a coding means in two circumstances: (a) in the non-perfective clause with a pronominal direct object and no indirect object (S O V)...""
   - This suggests that SVO is a common order, especially in perfective clauses.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""Different linear orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and moods.""
   - This indicates variability but does not contradict the SVO order in perfective clauses.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""The subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and verb.""
   - ""A direct object noun immediately follows the verb.""
   - This supports the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 15**:
   - ""The subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and verb.""
   - ""In a perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun follows the verb.""
   - This again supports the SVO order in perfective clauses.

7. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""In a perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun follows the verb.""
   - ""In a non-perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun precedes the verb.""
   - This indicates that while there is variability, the SVO order is dominant in perfective clauses.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in Lamé is SVO, particularly in perfective/subjunctive clauses. While there is variability in non-perfective clauses, the SVO order is consistently mentioned as the primary structure in the most neutral and common contexts.",svo,svo
Bininj Gun-Wok,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Bininj Gun-Wok can be inferred as follows:

- **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that all orderings are grammatically possible and that there is no evidence that particular orders (like SVO) are used to disambiguate sentences. However, it also states that the commonest orders in transitive clauses with one external nominal group are OV, SV, and VO. This suggests a tendency towards OV and SV orders when there is one external nominal group.

- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples illustrating each order for transitive clauses. It notes that verb-initial orders are the rarest and that it was difficult to find clear examples of verb-initial orders in Gun-djeihmi. This suggests that verb-initial orders (VSO, VOS) are not dominant.

- **Paragraph 3**: It discusses the importance of word order in the organization of discourse and mentions that the grammatical function of word order is limited. It also states that the few grammatical word order rules involve non-arguments tending to follow the verb rather than precede it. This supports the idea that OV and SV orders are common.

- **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with different word orders, including SOV and SVO. It shows that SOV and SVO orders are used, but it does not provide a clear indication of which is more frequent.

- **Paragraph 5**: It discusses the use of pronominal prefixes and the flexibility of word order in Bininj Gun-Wok. It mentions that external nominals are not obligatory and that the language relies heavily on pronominal prefixation on the verb. This suggests that word order may be more flexible, but it does not provide a clear dominant order.

- **Paragraph 6**: It mentions that the use of subordinating conjunctions is common in adverbial clauses and that tightly-linked strings of finite verbs are often used. This suggests that word order may be influenced by discourse factors rather than strict syntactic rules.

- **Paragraph 7**: It discusses the difficulty of identifying a phrase-like group due to the lack of ordering restrictions when a sequence of nominal words occurs together. This supports the idea that word order is flexible and influenced by discourse factors.

- **Paragraph 8**: It provides examples of sentences with different word orders, including SOV and SVO. It shows that both orders are used, but it does not provide a clear indication of which is more frequent.

- **Paragraph 9**: It discusses the structure of the verbal word and the importance of pronominal prefixation. It mentions that the order of slots in the verbal word does not directly reflect iconic ordering principles, suggesting that word order is flexible.

- **Paragraph 10**: It defines grammatical relations and discusses the use of pronominal prefixes and incorporated nominals. It mentions that external nominals are not obligatory, supporting the idea that word order is flexible.

- **Paragraph 11**: It discusses the use of pronominal prefixes and the flexibility of word order. It mentions that external nominals are not obligatory and that the language relies heavily on pronominal prefixation on the verb.

- **Paragraph 12**: It discusses the use of subordinating conjunctions and the flexibility of word order in adverbial clauses. It mentions that tightly-linked strings of finite verbs are often used, suggesting that word order is influenced by discourse factors.

- **Paragraph 13**: It discusses the difficulty of identifying a phrase-like group due to the lack of ordering restrictions when a sequence of nominal words occurs together. This supports the idea that word order is flexible and influenced by discourse factors.

Based on the analysis of these paragraphs, it appears that Bininj Gun-Wok has a flexible word order with a tendency towards OV and SV orders when there is one external nominal group. However, there is no clear indication of a single dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Not mentioned in the grammar.",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Wardaman,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman offer a detailed analysis of the language's word order. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the ordering of object, agent, and subject. It mentions that while different orders are grammatically acceptable, there is a tendency for noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verb rather than after it. Specifically, subjects show a marked tendency to occur before the verb, while objects and ergative-marked agents show less difference in their position relative to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples from various texts, showing instances of ergative-marked agents and objects. The examples include orders such as AVO, OVA, and VOA, indicating variability in word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the positioning of participants in tone units, with examples showing participants presented as new information in the first position of the unit. This suggests a tendency for subjects to appear early in the clause.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions that indefinite qualifiers tend to precede the nominal they modify, but the reverse order is also found. This indicates some flexibility in word order within noun phrases.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the importance of prosodically defined units and their interaction with grammatical structure. It notes that intransitive subjects, transitive objects, and ergative-marked agents tend to occur preceding the verb, with the tendency being strongest for intransitive subjects.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Addresses the concept of ""free"" word order in Australian languages, including Wardaman. It acknowledges greater freedom of ordering compared to languages like English but also notes that not all orders are equally common.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the ordering tendencies within noun phrases, indicating that certain modifiers tend to follow the nominal they modify, while others may precede it.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions generic-specific noun phrases, with examples showing both generic-specific and specific-generic orders.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Summarizes noun phrase constituency and ordering, noting that noun phrases can consist of a single word or multiple words with various modifiers.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Provides examples of noun phrase structures, including demonstrative + nominal combinations.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the ordering of pronominal elements in the verb prefix system, indicating that first person elements tend to appear before others.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Summarizes noun phrase constituency, noting various types of noun phrases and their internal syntax.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the distribution of the element ""gu"" in pronominal prefixes, indicating its role in marking nonsingular objects.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses possessive constructions, noting that the possessor nominal may occur before or after the head noun.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Summarizes noun phrase coordination, noting that coordination is often achieved by juxtaposition without overt coordinators.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses finite verbs and their marking for subject and object, indicating that verbs can be marked for up to two participants.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of modifiers and their ordering relative to the nominal they modify.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the notion of ""difference"" in noun phrases, noting that demonstratives tend to precede the nominal they modify.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of two-clause tone groups, indicating that clauses can be linked prosodically.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses particle cooccurrence and their role in narrative structure, indicating that particles can occur without a finite verb but still convey meaning.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The analysis of the provided paragraphs indicates that while Wardaman exhibits some tendencies in word order, such as subjects often preceding the verb, there is significant variability and flexibility in the ordering of constituents. This variability suggests that Wardaman does not have a single dominant word order, as different orders are used in various contexts and are grammatically acceptable. Therefore, the conclusion is that Wardaman lacks a dominant word order.",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that ""constituent order is 'free' (Dixon 1980:441), in the sense that changing it does not affect the referential or experiential meaning (Halliday 1974:47) of a clause."" This suggests that Gooniyandi allows for flexible word order.

2. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of constituency trees and mentions that the order of entities can vary, indicating flexibility in word order.

3. **Paragraph 6** discusses the placement of enclitics and their interaction with the verb phrase, further supporting the idea of flexible word order.

4. **Paragraph 13** provides examples of existential clauses where the order of the Location and Existent phrases can vary, again indicating flexibility.

5. **Paragraph 15** discusses thematic structures and tagging, which implies that the order of constituents can be manipulated for discourse purposes.

6. **Paragraph 17** mentions that postpositions can attach to any word in a phrase, indicating that the syntactic structure is not rigidly fixed.

7. **Paragraph 18** provides examples of identifying clauses with different orders, showing that the subject and object can appear in various positions.

8. **Paragraph 19** discusses the flexibility in the construction of the classifier complex, which suggests that the verb phrase can accommodate different orders of subject and object.

From these observations, it is clear that Gooniyandi does not have a rigid word order and allows for flexibility in the arrangement of subject, object, and verb. This flexibility is used to encode pragmatic information such as topicalization or focus.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Tiwi:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the word order in Modern Tiwi (MT) and Traditional Tiwi (TT). It mentions that in MT, where there is only an uninflected verb, the word order has become rigid, being SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object). This suggests an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order. It also states that when there is an inflected verb, there is greater freedom, but the normal order is still SPO.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explains that in TT, the clause may consist of just a verb, and most arguments of the verb may be indicated in the verb. However, when arguments are external to the verb, they can be unmarked noun phrases. This implies some flexibility in word order but does not contradict the SVO order mentioned in Paragraph 1.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of direct objects following the verb, reinforcing the SVO order. It also mentions that in casual MT or children's Tiwi, where there is no inflected verb, the word order is fairly rigidly SVO.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses transitive clauses in TT, stating that the unmarked order is SPO (SVO), but this may vary due to discourse considerations. It also mentions that variations are due to discourse considerations, but the unmarked order remains SVO.

5. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in MT where the normal order is (S)PO, but when there is no overt subject, the order OP may occur. However, this does not contradict the dominant SVO order when both subject and object are present.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the subject and direct object in TT, stating that neither have case-marking and cannot be distinguished by word order differences, but the unmarked order is SPO (SVO).

From these paragraphs, it is clear that both in Traditional Tiwi (TT) and Modern Tiwi (MT), the dominant word order in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is SVO. This is explicitly stated in multiple paragraphs and supported by examples.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Nakkara,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Nakkara:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Provides an example of an intransitive sentence: ""Mother laughed."" This does not directly inform us about the transitive word order but shows that the subject precedes the verb in intransitive sentences.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that a basic transitive clause consists of a single transitive verb-complex, and the pronominal prefix of this verb-complex codes both the transitive subject (A) and transitive object (O). This suggests that the verb-complex is central to the clause structure, but it does not specify the order of subject, object, and verb.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the pronominal prefix (PP) and mentions that in transitive verbs, the PP codes the transitive subject (A) and transitive object (O). It also notes that the ordering of (A) and (O) marking in the PP is complex and subject to morphological analysis. This indicates that the verb-complex (including the PP) is crucial in determining the structure but does not give a clear SOV, SVO, etc., order.

4. **Paragraph 7**: States that verbs and nominals constitute the major word classes and that major grammatical relations are coded within the verb-complex. This implies that the verb-complex is a central element in the clause, but again, it does not specify the exact order of S, O, and V.

5. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses clause structure and mentions that a simple verbal predicate consists minimally of a single verb complex, which can be expanded to include inner-core participants (the intransitive subject, the transitive subject, and the transitive object). This suggests that the verb complex is central, but the exact order of S, O, and V is not specified.

6. **Paragraph 19**: Provides an example of a transitive sentence: ""I gave the goose to Milak and Wamud."" The structure ""I=them(A)=O)WamudMilak-na+give -PAST"" suggests that the subject (I) comes first, followed by the object (them), and then the verb (give). This indicates an SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 20**: Provides another example of a transitive sentence: ""So then he left the woman behind for him and he took her off with him."" The structure ""ki.+kka3M(A) +take 3Mf(O)nawara_ womanki +bbawa -na 3M(A) tleave -PC/T 3Mf(O) behind-yabarr+nge-ba-na-PC/T3UAf+UA (S)-go-PC/Tliyawa 3MOBLQ (Ben.)"" suggests that the subject (he) comes first, followed by the object (her), and then the verb (take). This also indicates an SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the examples and descriptions provided, the dominant word order in Nakkara appears to be **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Garrwa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, the following observations can be made regarding the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Indicates that the verb is the initial element in declarative sentences of positive polarity where there is no marked pragmatic constituent. This suggests a verb-initial order in unmarked contexts.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**: Explicitly states that Garrwa has a verb-initial basic word order. This is reinforced by examples and the analysis provided in the paragraph.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb appears initially, followed by pronouns and other elements. This further supports the verb-initial order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses non-canonical word orders, indicating that deviations from the verb-initial order are pragmatically or grammatically motivated, implying that the verb-initial order is the default.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that the canonical word order in simple sentences includes the verb in the initial position, followed by tense/aspect/mood (TAM) clitics and pronouns, with nominal arguments following these elements.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Provides examples where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, reinforcing the verb-initial order.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the ordering of arguments and indicates that nominal arguments typically follow the second-position clitic cluster, which follows the verb.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of interrogative and negative sentences where the verb follows the initial interrogative or negative particle, again suggesting a verb-initial order in declarative contexts.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Illustrates that the core of a sentence, which includes the verb, is often preceded by conjunctions or adjuncts, but the verb remains in the initial position within the core.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses pragmatically determined non-canonical orders, indicating that deviations from the verb-initial order are used for emphasis or focus, implying that the verb-initial order is the default.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, supporting the verb-initial order.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the interaction between prosody and word order, indicating that the verb-initial order is maintained even when other elements are emphasized prosodically.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, reinforcing the verb-initial order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the positioning of grammatical information in the second position, following the verb, which is in the initial position.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Provides examples of intransitive and transitive constructions where the verb is initial, followed by arguments.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses information packaging and the marking of prominence, indicating that the verb-initial order is maintained even when other elements are emphasized.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, supporting the verb-initial order.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the ordering of dependent clauses, indicating that the verb-initial order is maintained in both main and dependent clauses.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, reinforcing the verb-initial order.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb is initial, followed by pronouns and nominal arguments, supporting the verb-initial order.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Ngankikurungkurr,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ngankikurungkurr can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 10** provides the most relevant information regarding the order of constituents in declarative sentences. It states that ""The complex verb constitutes a single phonological word (having only a single primary word stress, cf. 2.5.3) and is typically ordered with the verb stem following the auxiliary, as in 3-2 and 3-4."" This suggests that the verb (V) follows the auxiliary, which is part of the verb complex. The examples provided in this paragraph show the verb stem following the auxiliary, indicating that the verb comes after the subject and object in the sentence structure.

2. **Example 3-5** in Paragraph 10: ""derrigidi-wurrmum-ngi want-3plHands-1sgSU Pres DO They want/like me."" Here, the structure shows the subject (3plHands) preceding the verb (want) and the object (1sgSU).

3. **Example 3-6** in Paragraph 10: ""perrety-meny die-3sgSaySU Perf He died."" Although this example is intransitive, it still shows the verb following the subject.

4. **Paragraph 13** provides another example: ""ngerim-ne-tyerr-baty-ngannunggu 1sgHands-3sg-mouth-hold-1plexGodlSU PresSUIOSU Pres I am leading him along."" Here, the subject (1sgHands) precedes the verb (hold) and the object (3sg-mouth).

5. **Paragraph 17** also supports the SVO structure: ""wa-wunu wupun-@-ta, e M-there 3sgSlash-3sg-hit and cl SU Perf DO wa-wunu-ninggi dam-© -pawal M-there-AGENT 3sgPoke-3sg-spear cl SUPerf DO He hit that man, then that man speared him."" The subject (3sgSlash) precedes the verb (hit) and the object (3sg).

From these examples, it is clear that the subject (S) typically precedes the verb (V), and the object (O) follows the verb (V). Therefore, the dominant word order in Ngankikurungkurr is SVO.

**Conclusion:** SVO",no dominant order,svo
Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, the following points are relevant for determining the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It explicitly states that Wagiman does not have a normal SOV order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the difficulty in determining any order due to the rarity of both A (Agent) and O (Object) occurring together in transitive clauses. It mentions that the overwhelming choice for the single overt free nominal was O, while A occurred overtly only in 4 sentences. This indicates a lack of clear evidence for a dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph highlights the freedom of constituent order in Wagiman, mentioning that 59 different sentence order types occur. It also states that only 6 sentences actually contained both A and O, indicating no strong order tendencies.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph explicitly states that there is a lack of evidence for any 'basic word order' in Wagiman, as it is extremely rare for sentences to contain free nominal expressions of both A and O or even Si (intransitive subject).

5. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides some statistical data, indicating that O tended to occur initially or before V and/or A in 36 clauses, but followed A or V in 12 clauses. However, it concludes that no clear favoured orders can be determined from the data.

6. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the structural and semantic generalizations concerning the relationships between finite verbs and participles, indicating a flexible order.

From these points, it is clear that Wagiman exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order, with no single order being dominant. The language allows various orders depending on pragmatic and discourse factors, and there is no consistent pattern that can be identified as the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"### Reasoning

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian) exhibits flexibility in word order, with examples of SVO, SOV, and VSO structures. However, the most frequently mentioned and exemplified order is Subject—Verb—Object (SVO).

**Conclusion: SVO**",sov,svo
English,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of English, the dominant word order in English can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1:** This paragraph discusses the ungrammaticality of placing the object before the predicator (verb) and the subject, emphasizing that the subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb in canonical declarative sentences. Examples like ""You heard their arguments"" (SVO) and the ungrammatical ""*Their arguments heard you"" (OVS) support this.
   - **Paragraph 3:** This paragraph mentions that in open interrogatives, if the interrogative element is the subject, the order remains the same as in declarative sentences (SVO). For example, ""Who bought it?"" (SVO) versus ""What did you buy?"" (VSO), indicating that the default declarative order is SVO.
   - **Paragraph 4:** This paragraph explicitly states that the default position of the subject is before the predicator (verb), and the object’s basic position is after the predicator, reinforcing the SVO order. Examples like ""You heard their arguments"" (SVO) and ""Their arguments you heard"" (OSV) further illustrate this.
   - **Paragraph 14:** This paragraph contrasts canonical sentences with passive and preposing constructions, showing that in canonical sentences like ""She took the others"" (SVO), the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.
   - **Paragraph 16:** This paragraph discusses the position of adverbs relative to lexical verbs and auxiliaries, but it indirectly supports the SVO order by showing that the subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb in declarative sentences.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in English declarative sentences, where both the subject and the object are nouns, is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo
Korean,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, the dominant word order in Korean can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the typical sentence structure in Korean, emphasizing that sentences usually end in a verb. It provides examples such as ""Ayki ka emeni lul ponta"" (The baby looks at the mother) and ""Emeni ka ayki lul ponta"" (The mother looks at the baby), which follow the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.
   - **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph also supports the SOV order by providing examples like ""Kay lul pap ul mekinta"" (I feed the dog), where the subject (Kay) precedes the object (pap) and the verb (mekinta).
   - **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides further examples of the SOV order, such as ""Cikum emeni ayki ponta"" (Now the mother looks at the baby), where the subject (emeni) precedes the object (ayki) and the verb (ponta).
   - **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of the accusative particle ul/lul to mark the direct object, reinforcing the SOV structure. For example, ""hak.kyo lul kanta"" (goes to school) follows the SOV order.
   - **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph mentions the nominative particle i/ka and the accusative particle ul/lul, which are used to mark the subject and object, respectively, in an SOV structure.

The consistent use of the SOV order in these examples and explanations indicates that Korean predominantly follows the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order.

2. **Conclusion:**
   - **SOV**",sov,sov
Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, several key points emerge regarding the dominant word order in Basque:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that SOV is considered the 'neutral' or 'basic' word order in Basque. It also discusses how other orders often imply focalization or emphasis, indicating that SOV is the default, unmarked order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that the subject-object order is required in certain syntactic constructions, and that verb-finality is a characteristic feature of Basque. It also mentions that absolutive sequences are interpreted as subject-object sequences, further supporting the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph states that most Basque grammarians have identified SOV as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order. It provides an example sentence that follows the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 4**: It contrasts the verb-final order in predicative and equative constructions with nominal arguments, indicating that verb-finality is the most neutral order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the tendency for heavy elements to occur to the right, but it also mentions that the neutral position of nominal objects is preverbal, which aligns with an SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 6**: It describes the prominence of the word preceding the verb, which is consistent with an SOV order where the object typically precedes the verb.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions that the standard word order in Basque finite clauses has the auxiliary following the verb, but it does not contradict the SOV order for main clauses.

8. **Paragraph 8**: It discusses the changes in word order due to negation but still maintains the verb-final characteristic in neutral contexts.

9. **Paragraph 9**: It mentions that altering the neutral or canonical order affects the interpretation of new or focalized information, implying that the neutral order is SOV.

Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can extract relevant information to determine the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""the verb usually occupies the final position in the sentence,"" indicating a tendency towards SOV order. However, it also notes that word order is not rigid, suggesting some flexibility.

2. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of sentences with verbs in the final position, such as ""Let me give her this child"" and ""Let me give her this book."" These examples align with the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 13** discusses various drills and exercises aimed at practicing the normal word order of sentences, which implies that there is a standard or dominant order that learners are encouraged to use.

4. **Paragraph 14** provides an example sentence structure: ""It is he who tells the matter,"" which, although not a direct SOV example, shows the verb in a final position in a complex sentence.

From these observations, it is clear that while Malayalam exhibits some flexibility in word order, the dominant pattern, especially in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns, is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Iu Mien,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Mien appears to be a complex issue influenced by pragmatic factors rather than a strictly grammaticalized structure. Here is the reasoning based on the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It argues against the common view that Iu Mien is an SVO language, suggesting that SVO order is rare in isolation and that word order is better explained by pragmatic principles.
2. **Paragraph 2**: While it acknowledges that Iu Mien shows SVO order in pragmatically neutral clauses, it also emphasizes the role of object-fronting for discourse-pragmatic purposes.
3. **Paragraph 3**: It mentions that the basic constituent order is still SVO, even with modifications like adverbs or aspectual verbs.
4. **Paragraph 4**: It states that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language but does not have a strictly grammaticalized SVO pattern.
5. **Paragraph 5**: It reiterates that an isolated SVO order is rare and that Iu Mien uses word order to indicate grammatical relations, similar to other languages in the region.
6. **Paragraph 6**: It emphasizes that Iu Mien is not primarily an SVO language and that pragmatics play a more important role in word-order choice.
7. **Paragraph 7**: It provides examples of V-NP (seemingly VS) order in certain types of clauses, indicating flexibility in word order.
8. **Paragraph 9**: It discusses the principle that verb-medial word order does not necessarily mean SVO and provides examples of post-verbal subjects in specific constructions.
9. **Paragraph 10**: It describes Iu Mien as a topic-prominent language rather than an SVO language, with a common sentence structure of topic on the left and comment on the right.
10. **Paragraph 13**: It outlines principles that include verb-medial word order and the importance of pragmatics, stating that Iu Mien is not strictly an SVO language.
11. **Paragraph 18**: It states that while SVO order does occur, the topic-focus order is dominant in actual speech events and discourse.

From these points, it is clear that while SVO order is present in Iu Mien, it is not the dominant order in a strict grammatical sense. Instead, the language relies heavily on pragmatic principles, particularly topic-focus structure, to determine word order. Therefore, the dominant word order in Iu Mien cannot be classified as strictly SVO or any other fixed order.

Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Semelai, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

   - **Paragraph 1:** Mentions the complexity of determining a basic constituent order due to frequent partial representation and zero-representation of arguments.
   
   - **Paragraph 2:** States that in universal or generic transitive clauses, the order is AVO (SVO in terms of subject, verb, object).
   
   - **Paragraph 3:** Indicates that constituent order is fluid and driven by pragmatic factors, with a tendency for verb-initial structures in transitive clauses.
   
   - **Paragraph 5:** Emphasizes that constituent order is fluid and determined by various factors, including transitivity and discourse organization. It mentions a tendency for verb-initial structures in transitive clauses.
   
   - **Paragraph 6:** States that the most frequently employed constituent order is verb-initial, with A and O (or S) placed after the verb.
   
   - **Paragraph 9:** Notes that although both OV and VO are allowable, the preferred pattern in concatenated clauses appears to be VO.
   
   - **Paragraph 14:** Mentions that in complement clauses, the order is V (O) (PP), which aligns with the universal clause order.
   
   - **Paragraph 19:** Discusses the coding strategies for syntactic functions but does not directly address word order.

   From these observations, it is clear that while there is some flexibility in word order, there is a strong tendency for verb-initial structures, particularly in transitive clauses. This suggests that the dominant word order in Semelai is likely to be VSO (Verb-Subject-Object).

2. **Conclusion:** VSO",no dominant order,vso

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses deviations from the SOV order, such as right dislocation and clause-initial objects. However, it reinforces that SOV is the basic order by describing these deviations as exceptions.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that the most frequent word order is verb-final, which aligns with the SOV order. It also mentions that the relative order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles, but the verb-final order is preferred.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph states that word order patterns in Kolyma Yukaghir are overwhelmingly head-final, which includes SOV in main clauses. It mentions that other word orders are possible but less common.

5. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph notes that placing the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position before the A constituent is prohibited by word-order rules, reinforcing the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph describes a special case of split intransitivity but still aligns with the SOV structure by associating the S participant with either Nominative or Predicative marking, depending on its role in the clause.

7. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences that follow the SOV order, further supporting the claim that SOV is the dominant word order.

Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), we can determine the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the usual word order in Nivkh is ""topic - embedded clause - adverbials - subject - causee - secondary object - primary object - predicate."" This suggests a general SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure, with the subject preceding the object and the verb coming at the end.

2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Nivkh is a head-marking SOV language"" and mentions that the syntax is organized according to an S/A pivot. This directly supports the SOV word order.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides an example of word order with ditransitive verbs: ""Subject ^ Secondary Object ^ Primary Object-Predicate."" This again aligns with an SOV structure, where the subject comes first, followed by the objects, and the verb is at the end.

4. **Paragraph 7** provides an example sentence: ""ni Tagun-әskәm-ḑ zadaţa"" (I explained the exercise to Tagun), where ""ni"" (I) is the subject, ""zadaţa"" (exercise) is the object, and ""Tagun-әskәm-ḑ"" (explained to Tagun) is the verb phrase. This example also follows the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 11** discusses the focus position and mentions that the primary object is 'excorporated' and fronted when focused, freeing the pre-predicate position. This indicates that the default position of the object is before the verb, consistent with SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 14** states that secondary objects are free constituents and never marked on the verb, and that the undergoer-verb complex may be dissolved under certain conditions. However, the default order remains SOV.

7. **Paragraph 19** compares Nivkh to other languages and mentions that Nivkh has a fixed SOV word order, reinforcing the dominant SOV structure.

### Conclusion:

- Example (258b): ""pyana tsi agai-da pumba-d-i"" translates to ""Yesterday I beat the dog.""
  - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject (S), ""agai-da"" (dog-ACC) is the object (O), and ""pumba-d-i"" (beat-1-PAST) is the verb (V).
  - The order is SOV.

#### Paragraph 9:
- Example (309b): ""na tsi d~aba-d-i gimi, n˙n-da e-d-u-wa"" translates to ""This is money that I found, I will not give it to you.""
  - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject (S), ""d~aba-d-i"" (find-1-PAST) is the verb (V), and ""gimi"" (money) is the object (O).
  - The order is SVO.

#### Paragraph 14:
- Example (226d): ""na tsi kila-d-ßn gimi"" translates to ""This is money that I stole.""
  - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject (S), ""kila-d-ßn"" (steal-1-REAL) is the verb (V), and ""gimi"" (money) is the object (O).
  - The order is SVO.

#### Paragraph 19:
- Example (147b): ""tul-a-t-ßn"" translates to ""I dressed (someone).""
  - Here, ""tsi"" (I) is the subject (S), ""tul"" (dress) is the verb (V), and the object is implied but not explicitly mentioned.
  - The order is SVO.

#### Paragraph 20:
- Example (107b): ""gina g-˙m-da-n"" translates to ""They ate.""
  - Here, ""gina"" (he) is the subject (S), ""g-˙m-da-n"" (eat-PL-REAL) is the verb (V), and there is no explicit object.
  - The order is SV.

### Analysis:
The examples provided show a mixture of SOV and SVO word orders. However, the majority of the examples with explicit subjects and objects tend to follow the SOV pattern, especially in transitive sentences where both subject and object are present.

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples of sentences with clear SOV structure:
     - ""Mamasa ule:-we olokto-ini."" (The old woman meat-ACC cook-3SG) - 'The old woman is cooking meat.'
     - ""Omölo-i wopti-we kimpigi-e-ni."" (Granddaughter-1SG door-ACC close-PAST-3SG) - 'My granddaughter closed the door.'
     - ""Cinda-ziga jegdige ag'a-du kuge-we kuge:-ti."" (Bird-PL hero brother-DAT bellows-ACC blow.PAST-3PL) - 'The birds blew (the fire) with bellows for the brother hero.'

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Explicitly states that Udihe exhibits features of a head-final SOV language and provides statistical evidence that SOV is the most common order.
   - ""The SOV order is the most common statistically as well.""

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses the importance of the preverbal position of the focus element, which often results in the object being placed before the verb, supporting the SOV structure.
   - ""The most important requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position of the focus element. In a clause that does not involve any constituents other than SOV, this, under normal discourse conditions, results in the preverbal position of the object.""

4. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Mentions that adverbials and other elements can be positioned freely as long as the focus element is preverbal, which aligns with the SOV structure.
   - ""In general, there is a certain freedom of adverbial positioning, as long as the main requirement of Udihe word order, the preverbal position of the focus element, is satisfied.""

5. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Notes that the object may be postposed without particular information structure motivation, indicating some flexibility but still within the context of SOV being the norm.
   - ""In the language of the younger generation the object may be postposed without any particular information structure motivation, under the influence of Russian.""

6. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Provides examples of sentences where the subject focus can lead to OSV or SVO order, indicating some flexibility but not overriding the dominance of SOV.
   - ""When the subject bears a focus status, the possible word orders are OSV or SVO.""

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Udihe is SOV, as evidenced by the statistical prevalence of this order and the structural requirements that align with SOV, despite some flexibility influenced by information structure and external language influences.",sov,sov
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can analyze the dominant word order in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Ingush is a consistently head-final language except for predominantly verb-second order in main clauses. This suggests a flexible word order but indicates a tendency towards verb-final structures in non-main clauses.

2. **Paragraph 2** specifies that Ingush uses verb-final order in non-main and some main clauses, and verb-second order in most main clauses. It also mentions that the basic order of arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV, which indicates a preference for subject-object-verb (SOV) order in pragmatically neutral main clauses.

3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the grammatically most basic order of arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV, and provides examples that support this structure. It also mentions that this order is not rigid and can change based on pragmatic factors.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of verb-second order in main clauses but also shows verb-final order in pragmatically neutral contexts, reinforcing the idea that SOV is a common structure.

5. **Paragraph 5** discusses argument focus and mentions that the focal nominal or NP is often clause-initial, with the verb following immediately after it. This suggests that while verb-second order is common, verb-final order is also prevalent.

6. **Paragraph 6** mentions that temporal subordinates and complement clauses often require or favor verb-second order, but this does not negate the prevalence of verb-final order in other contexts.

7. **Paragraph 7** provides additional examples of verb-final order in non-main clauses and pragmatically neutral main clauses, further supporting the SOV structure.

8. **Paragraph 8** discusses verb-final order in episode-initial clauses and all-new spoken clauses, reinforcing the idea that SOV is a common structure in these contexts.

9. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** do not provide additional relevant information about the dominant word order.

10. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** provide examples of verb-final order in various contexts, supporting the SOV structure.

11. **Paragraph 13** discusses existential, locative, and possessive sentences, which follow an A patterner + O patterner + V structure, consistent with SOV order.

12. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** provide additional examples of verb-final order in various contexts, supporting the SOV structure.

13. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** do not provide additional relevant information about the dominant word order.

14. **Paragraph 18** discusses word order in core chaining, mentioning that main clauses in core chaining constructions are verb-initial, but this does not negate the prevalence of verb-final order in other contexts.

15. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** do not provide additional relevant information about the dominant word order.

Overall, the evidence from the provided paragraphs indicates that while Ingush exhibits some flexibility in word order, the dominant order in pragmatically neutral contexts, especially in non-main clauses and some main clauses, is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",no dominant order,sov
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can determine the dominant word order in the language by examining the positions of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e., verb-final. This suggests a tendency towards SOV order, but it also notes that alternative orders are possible, especially in colloquial language.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides more specific information, stating that the finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This is illustrated with examples where the verb appears at the end of the sentence, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3** does not provide specific information about word order but mentions that the chapter deals with word order at the clause level.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the order of arguments and indicates that information structure (given vs. new information) can influence word order. However, it still suggests that the subject tends to precede other arguments, which aligns with an SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 5** reiterates that word order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final and that SOV order is preferred for clauses, although other orders are possible in spoken language.

6. **Paragraph 6** mentions specific conditions under which non-verb-final word order is usual, such as in the formulaic beginning of a fairy tale or in direct speech in narrative prose. However, these are exceptions rather than the norm.

7. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** focus on word order within noun phrases and do not provide direct information about the order of S, O, and V in clauses.

8. **Paragraph 9** discusses the general tendency for elements of a constituent to be adjacent and mentions that discontinuous noun phrases are prohibited, but it does not directly address the order of S, O, and V.

9. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** do not provide relevant information about the order of S, O, and V.

10. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** provide examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end, supporting the SOV order.

11. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss valence patterns and grammatical relations but do not provide specific information about the order of S, O, and V.

12. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss adverbial clauses and the position of arguments, indicating that the subject tends to precede other arguments, which is consistent with SOV order.

13. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** provide examples of sentences with verb-final order, reinforcing the SOV structure.

14. **Paragraph 20** discusses verbal valence patterns and provides examples where the verb appears at the end of the sentence, supporting the SOV order.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, we can determine the dominant word order in Yuki by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides several examples of Yuki sentences and explicitly states that Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final. The examples given (1) through (4) consistently show the verb at the end of the clause, indicating a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. For instance:
   - Example (1): ""you fellows laughed yesterday"" (SOV)
   - Example (2): ""I like to gig (hunt) fish"" (SOV)
   - Example (3): ""he gave me his (someone else’s) baby"" (SOV)
   - Example (4): ""And all [who were in the ceremonial house came out, and] looked"" (SOV)

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that Yuki is primarily suffixing and agglutinating, with grammatical relations marked on pronouns and some nouns. It also states that Yuki clauses are generally verb-final, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the use of switch-reference markers and clause connectors, which do not directly impact the basic word order but support the verb-final tendency in complex sentences.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph describes dependent clauses and relative clauses, noting that the dependent clause marker =namli is used, and these clauses are verb-final. This supports the overall verb-final structure of Yuki sentences.

5. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph describes the argument structure of Yuki, noting that agents are unmarked while patients are marked with an enclitic. This morphological marking aligns with the SOV structure, where the verb follows the subject and object.

6. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with primary stress on the initial syllable of the root, which is typically the first syllable of the word. This does not directly address word order but supports the consistency of verb-final clauses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the consistent evidence from multiple paragraphs indicating that Yuki clauses are generally verb-final, the dominant word order in Yuki is **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Pipil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences with both noun subjects and objects.

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - Examples of OV and SV orders are given, but these are noted to emphasize the object or subject, respectively.
   - Examples of VOS order are not provided in this paragraph.

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - It is explicitly stated that the most common neutral order for transitive sentences is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS).
   - VOS order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest frequency in texts and conversation, and it is the only order for transitive sentences which is neutral with respect to focus and emphasis.
   - Examples provided include:
     - ""ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin."" (VOS)
     - ""mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe."" (VOS)
     - ""kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk pih-pi:pil-met."" (VOS)
     - ""ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín."" (VOS)
     - ""ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t."" (VOS)
   - Other orders like SVO and VSO are mentioned but are less frequent and used for specific emphasis or with ""heavy"" objects.

3. **Paragraph 3:**
   - Examples of SVO and VSO orders are provided, but these are noted to occur with less frequency and under specific conditions (e.g., subject emphasis or heavy objects).

4. **Paragraph 4:**
   - Discusses copular sentences and the order of modifiers, which is not directly relevant to determining the dominant order of subject, object, and verb in transitive clauses.

5. **Paragraph 5:**
   - Discusses the order when the subject is a pronoun, which is not directly relevant to the order of noun subjects and objects.

6. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Provides examples of verb-initial transitive sentences with pronominal subjects or objects, which is not directly relevant to the order of noun subjects and objects.

7. **Paragraph 7:**
   - Discusses pronominal object prefixes, which is not directly relevant to the order of noun subjects and objects.

8. **Paragraph 8:**
   - Provides examples of relativized subjects and objects, which is not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

9. **Paragraph 9:**
   - Discusses question formation, which is not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

10. **Paragraph 10:**
    - Provides examples of verb phrases and other constructions, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

11. **Paragraph 11:**
    - Discusses grammatical categories and morphology, which is not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

12. **Paragraph 12:**
    - Provides examples of plural formation and other morphological details, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

13. **Paragraph 13:**
    - Discusses cleft sentences, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

14. **Paragraph 14:**
    - Discusses adjectives, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

15. **Paragraph 15:**
    - Discusses numbers and locatives, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

16. **Paragraph 16:**
    - Discusses phonological processes, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

17. **Paragraph 17:**
    - Discusses phonological rules, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

18. **Paragraph 18:**
    - Provides examples of purpose clauses, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

19. **Paragraph 19:**
    - Discusses verb morphology, which is not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

20. **Paragraph 20:**
    - Discusses coordinate constructions and complement clauses, which are not directly relevant to the basic word order in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
**VOS**",no dominant order,vos
Micmac,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Micmac, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that in transitive verbs, copies of both the object and subject must appear after the verb stem in some order, and it is advisable to have the object copy precede the subject copy. This suggests a structure where the verb comes first, followed by the object, and then the subject (VOS).

2. **Paragraph 4** further supports this by stating that the object marker should precede the subject marker, both following the verb stem. This again indicates a VOS order.

3. **Paragraph 5** describes a structure where the verb is followed by the subject and object markers, which could imply a VSO order. However, this is less clear than the previous paragraphs.

4. **Paragraph 8** provides an underlying structure for Micmac as follows: Subject, Verb (stem). This suggests an SVO order but does not explicitly mention the object.

5. **Paragraph 10** describes a structure where the subject and object are right daughters of the verb, with the closest NP being copied first. This could imply a VOS order if the object is closer to the verb than the subject.

6. **Paragraph 12** mentions rules affecting the order of subject and object markers, with some forms appearing in subject-object order and others in object-subject order. This indicates some flexibility but does not clearly establish a dominant order.

7. **Paragraph 17** describes transformations that delete object markers in certain forms, which might affect the surface word order but does not provide a clear dominant order.

Considering the evidence from the paragraphs, particularly Paragraphs 3 and 4, which explicitly describe a VOS structure, it is reasonable to conclude that the dominant word order in Micmac is VOS.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tepehua (Huehuetla), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the statistical frequencies and examples given.

1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Paragraph 1** (Table 32, Table 33, Table 34):
     - The most frequent word order in transitive clauses with two overt arguments is SVO (39.5%), followed by VSO (34.2%), OVS (13.2%), and VOS (10.5%). SOV does not occur at all.
     - When only one argument is present, VO (65.3%) is much more common than OV (18.1%).
   - **Paragraph 4** (Table 34):
     - Reiterates the frequencies of SVO (39.5%) and VSO (34.2%) as the most common orders in transitive clauses with two arguments.
   - **Paragraph 7**:
     - Summarizes that in texts with ample context and pragmatic cues, SVO is somewhat more frequent than VSO, and all other word orders (except SOV) are possible but less frequent.

2. **Examples and Elicitation**:
   - **Paragraph 3**:
     - Provides examples of all possible word orders (SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV, OVS) and notes that all are acceptable in certain contexts.
     - Indicates that in pragmatically neutral clauses, VSO is the volunteered word order, but SVO is also readily accepted.
   - **Paragraph 6**:
     - Discusses the influence of pragmatics and context on word order, noting that SVO and VSO are dominant orders.
   - **Paragraph 13**:
     - Mentions that the word order in subordinate clauses follows the same patterns as in main clauses, with VSO and SVO being preferred.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The statistical data and examples indicate a strong preference for SVO and VSO word orders in Tepehua (Huehuetla). While both orders are common, SVO appears slightly more frequently in natural discourse, and VSO is often used in elicited examples and pragmatically neutral contexts.
   - Given the close frequencies and the acceptance of both orders, it is reasonable to conclude that Tepehua (Huehuetla) has **No dominant order** between SVO and VSO.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Musqueam,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the relevant information for determining the dominant word order in Musqueam can be found in Paragraph 6:

> ""Pluralized objects with and their occur, but mulaet Vj,g-O-S,,P verbs: subjects-S,-O0, S, only as plAN always agreement pluralized these almost requires in number bet-and O is obligatory shown in the (A Nee ypl?""

This paragraph indicates that the word order in Musqueam can be VOS, as it mentions ""Vj,g-O-S"" and ""subjects-S,-O0, S,"" which suggests that the verb often precedes the object and the subject. The mention of ""Vj,g-O-S"" directly points to a verb-object-subject order.

Given this information, it appears that the dominant word order in Musqueam is VOS.

### Reasoning:
- The phrase ""Vj,g-O-S"" suggests a verb-object-subject order.
- The structure ""subjects-S,-O0, S,"" supports the idea that the subject follows the object and verb.

### Conclusion:
VOS",vso,vos
Omaha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, several key points about the word order in Omaha can be extracted:

1. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states: ""Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after their nouns, whether these are subject or object. This is entirely different than in English, where object nouns normally come after their verb. Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught (transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse (object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].""

   This indicates that the verb follows both the subject and the object, suggesting an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 3** mentions: ""A noun can be modified by a verb. When this happens in English, we put the verb in front of the noun. In Omaha, the verb follows the noun.""

   This reinforces the idea that verbs follow nouns, supporting the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 9** states: ""In Omaha a verb can stand alone as a complete sentence, without needing a subject in front of it as in English. The subject is implied.""

   While this indicates that verbs can stand alone, it does not contradict the SOV order when both subject and object are present.

4. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 19** discuss verb chains and pronoun combinations but do not provide direct evidence about the order of subject, object, and verb in simple declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 1**, **Paragraph 5**, **Paragraph 6**, **Paragraph 7**, **Paragraph 8**, **Paragraph 10**, **Paragraph 11**, **Paragraph 12**, **Paragraph 13**, **Paragraph 14**, **Paragraph 15**, **Paragraph 16**, **Paragraph 17**, **Paragraph 18**, and **Paragraph 20** do not provide relevant information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns.

### Conclusion:

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Koasati can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object, verb (SOV). This is a clear indication of the dominant word order.
2. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the order with the object following the verb (SVO) is quite unusual and occurs in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the verbal element. This suggests that SVO is not the dominant order but rather a marked or less common variation.
3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the most unmarked word order is SOV, even though there are variations due to focus on the verb.
4. **Paragraph 4** supports the SOV order by stating that the most unmarked position for the sentence subject is before the verb in intransitive sentences and before the object in transitive sentences.
5. **Paragraph 5** provides an example where the word order is SVO due to emphasis on the verb, reinforcing that SOV is the unmarked or dominant order.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses the movement of objects and subjects in specific contexts but does not contradict the SOV dominance.
7. **Paragraph 10** mentions that the noun must precede the verb to indicate it is the object, which aligns with the SOV order.
8. **Paragraph 14** provides examples where the subject precedes the verb, consistent with SOV order.

From these observations, it is clear that the dominant word order in Koasati is SOV, with other orders occurring in marked or specific contexts.

Chumash (Barbareño),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the examples and descriptions of sentence structures.

#### Paragraph 1:
- The paragraph explicitly states that ""a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure.""
- It also mentions that ""Most clauses have at most one full NP,"" indicating that the VOS structure is observed when both subject and object are present as full NPs.

#### Paragraph 2:
- This paragraph provides multiple examples of sentences with the VOS structure:
  - Example (244): ""Right then the Indians lowered their arrows."" (VOS)
  - Example (245): ""and a white cloth covered her face."" (VOS)
  - Example (246): ""When a rattlesnake bites a person,"" (VOS)
- It also notes that the object-subject order can be reversed if the object NP is especially long, but this is an exception rather than the rule.

#### Paragraph 3:
- This paragraph does not provide relevant information about word order.

#### Paragraph 4:
- This paragraph discusses the positioning of adverbial clauses and their motivations but does not provide information about the basic word order of subject, object, and verb.

**Conclusion: VOS**",vos,vos
Yuchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

   - **Paragraph 2:** This paragraph provides a clear description of the basic word order in Yuchi. It states that in a two-place verb (transitive sentence), the order is Actor (A) then Patient (P), then Verb (V). This corresponds to the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order. The examples given, such as ""Sissy Sonny siothzshane"" (Sissy loves Sonny), further illustrate this order.
   
   - **Paragraph 3:** This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 2 by showing that while noun phrases can move for emphasis or focus, the basic word order remains APV (Actor-Patient-Verb), which aligns with SOV. The examples of possible and impossible word orders also support this.
   
   - **Paragraph 6:** This paragraph discusses the word order in causative constructions, where the basic order is Causer (A), Affected Patient (P), and then the verb (V), again supporting the SOV order.
   
   - **Paragraph 12:** This paragraph mentions that when all three participants are made into noun phrases, the most common word orders are Actor-Patient-Recipient/Beneficiary and Actor-Recipient/Beneficiary-Patient, which still align with the SOV structure.
   
   - **Paragraph 19:** This paragraph states that the affected participant can be at the end of the sentence, but the basic word order with the affected participant in the effect clause is given as Actor-Patient-Verb, further supporting the SOV order.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV

The dominant word order in Yuchi is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).",sov,sov
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, the following observations can be made regarding the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph indicates that the nominal object must appear after the verb but can precede or follow the subject. This suggests a preference for the object to follow the verb, which is indicative of a verb-final structure (SOV or OSV).

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that parts of the sentence can be shifted without impairing the sense, suggesting some flexibility in word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph states that nominal subjects can appear in initial, medial, or terminal positions, indicating flexibility in the position of the subject.

4. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions that the verb appears in terminal position, which aligns with a verb-final structure (SOV or OSV).

5. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph indicates that the position of certain syntactic particles is freely shifted and independent of the word to which they refer, suggesting flexibility in word order.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions that the verb must be preceded by certain prefixes, which again suggests a verb-final structure.

From these observations, it is clear that while Alsea exhibits some flexibility in word order, there is a strong tendency for the verb to appear at the end of the sentence, with the object typically following the verb. This aligns with an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure as the dominant word order.

### Conclusion: SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, we can analyze the information to determine the dominant word order. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses subject prefixes and verb forms but does not provide information on word order.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions word-for-word translation but does not specify the word order.
3. **Paragraph 3**: States that modes in Arikara are expressed by prefixes to the verb and do not require changes in word order, but does not specify what the word order is.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Indicates that the subject in English translation is the object in Arikara inflection, suggesting a different syntactic structure but not explicitly stating the word order.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that the order of word parts remains the same in negative and declarative sentences, but does not specify the order.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses imperative forms but does not provide information on declarative sentence word order.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Talks about grammatical additions to verbs and nouns but does not mention word order.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses singular and non-singular prefixes but does not provide information on word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses inclusive forms and modes but does not provide information on word order.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions verb patterns but does not specify the word order.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses indicative and negative prefixes but does not provide information on word order.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Talks about verbs describing how garments are worn but does not specify the word order.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Lists subject, verb form, and indicative prefix but does not specify the word order.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses gerunds but does not provide information on word order.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Talks about spoken and written sounds but does not mention word order.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Contains a conversation in Arikara but does not provide explicit information on word order.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses matching letters with English model words but does not mention word order.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Defines interrogative and intransitive verbs but does not provide information on word order.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Lists verb stems but does not specify the word order.

From the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of the dominant word order in Arikara. The information given focuses on other grammatical aspects such as prefixes, verb forms, and modes without specifying the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

**Conclusion: Not mentioned in the grammar.**",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides an example of a sentence structure: ""ne’k‘di o’k‘ik"" (WHO-GAVE IT? [=TO WHOM DID HE GIVE IT?]). This suggests a structure where the subject (ne’k‘di) precedes the verb (o’k‘ik).

2. **Paragraph 3** offers another example: ""dénadagwa hadele'p‘t"" (HIS-OWN (-dagwa) -EAR HE-PIERCED-IT). Here, the subject (dénadagwa) precedes the verb (hadele'p‘t), and the object (EAR) follows the verb.

3. **Paragraph 17** provides a clear example: ""HE FOUNDTHEANTsITne’k‘diis expressedvy thhist! tlaya‘k’, but THE ANTS FOUND HIM by tlibis't' tlayak‘wa."" This indicates that the subject (HE) precedes the verb (FOUND) and the object (ANTS) follows the verb.

These examples consistently show the subject preceding the verb and the object following the verb, indicating an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order.

**Reasoning:**
- The examples provided consistently show the subject preceding the verb and the object following the verb.
- The structure of the sentences aligns with the SVO order, where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

**Conclusion:** SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Jemez,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, we can analyze the word order in transitive declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 8:**
   - Example: ""d6- S6- tat&&"" ('I punched that man.')
     - Here, ""d6- S6-"" (that man) is the subject, ""tat&&"" (punched) is the verb, and the object is implied by the verb prefix.
   - Example: ""d6- S6-tq its-s'ae"" ('I was punched by that man.')
     - Here, ""d6- S6-"" (that man) is the subject, ""its-s'ae"" (punched) is the verb, and the object is implied by the verb prefix.

2. **Paragraph 13:**
   - Example: ""v&la dPli f&"" ('A man killed a chicken.')
     - Here, ""v&la"" (man) is the subject, ""dPli"" (chicken) is the object, and ""f&"" (killed) is the verb.
   - Example: ""nf qmf'"" ('I saw you (sg).')
     - Here, ""nf"" (I) is the subject, ""qmf'"" (you) is the object, and the verb is implied by the verb prefix.

3. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Example: ""John ~k~~&'r@k?a?e tan-$"" ('I saw John's dog')
     - Here, ""John"" is the subject, ""r@k?a?e"" (dog) is the object, and ""tan-$"" (saw) is the verb.

### Reasoning:
From the examples provided, the dominant word order in Jemez appears to be **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**. In the sentences where both the subject and object are nouns, the subject precedes the object, and the verb follows both.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, I will analyze the information to determine the dominant word order.

**Paragraph 1:**
- Mentions that focus movement restores SOV order and results in OSV word order in other clauses.

**Paragraph 2:**
- Describes OSV order as a result of object movement past the subject.

**Paragraph 3:**
- Discusses OSV word order in finite clauses with weak pronoun objects.

**Paragraph 4:**
- Illustrates the order of arguments as Subject - Indirect Object - Direct Object.

**Paragraph 5:**
- States that Zuni word order is strict SOV, with the verb appearing finally in its clause.

**Paragraph 6:**
- Notes that Zuni clauses with pronominal objects have OSV order, contrasting with SOV order found with lexical NP arguments.

**Paragraph 7:**
- Mentions OSV order as the unmarked order in certain cases.

**Paragraph 8:**
- Provides general information about the grammar and mentions verb-final order.

**Paragraph 9:**
- Discusses clitic order based on person features.

**Paragraph 10:**
- Talks about the rigid order of fronted WH words.

**Paragraph 11:**
- Describes the order of elements in noun phrases.

**Paragraph 12-20:**
- Provide various additional information, but not directly relevant to the dominant word order.

**Reasoning:**
- Paragraphs 1, 5, and 6 are particularly relevant. Paragraph 5 explicitly states that Zuni has a strict SOV order, with the verb appearing finally in its clause. Paragraph 6 supports this by contrasting the SOV order found with lexical NP arguments with the OSV order found in clauses containing pronominal objects. This suggests that while OSV order can occur, especially with pronouns, the basic or dominant order when both subject and object are lexical NPs is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Rama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1:** Mentions that Rama is an SOV language and that the word order is relatively rigid.
- **Paragraph 2:** Explicitly states that Rama is an SOV language, similar to Miskitu and Sumu, and mentions verb-final morphosyntax.
- **Paragraph 4:** Discusses the SOV word order of the language and provides examples that align with this structure.
- **Paragraph 6:** Reiterates that the basic word order of Rama is SOV.
- **Paragraph 8:** Provides text excerpts that demonstrate SOV word order in practice.
- **Paragraph 20:** Mentions that Rama has a strict SOV word order, especially in constructions involving relational preverbs and overt NPs.

The consistent mention of SOV word order across multiple paragraphs, along with examples and explicit statements, strongly indicates that SOV is the dominant word order in Rama.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Tonkawa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tonkawa, we can analyze the word order to determine the dominant order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

#### Paragraph 1:
- ""The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject, object and verb.""
- Example: ""gwa'n-enox-la henox yagnano'a"" (pretty woman he shoots well).

This paragraph explicitly states that the normal word order is subject-object-verb (SOV).

#### Paragraph 2:
- Example: ""'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o'"" (The bad dog severely bit a big man).
- Analysis: The sentence structure follows the SOV order: 'egwan (subject) - ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak (object) - djigeu nadj-o' (verb).

#### Paragraph 11:
- ""This sentence illustrates the usual word order in Tonkawa: subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal verb.""
- Example: ""/'e-kla'edcin'eha-nadaThenagaingoing off"" (subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal verb).

This paragraph confirms the usual word order as SOV, with additional modifiers and subordinated verbs.

#### Paragraph 19:
- Example: ""Vd cax'ai-lak yalba-da t'cel-'a'y'ik yela-k-la heilaban-awa'dak heigo'oklakno'o"" (and he set an arrow into the ground and, as he sat on top of it, it became a very tall tree, it is said).
- Analysis: The structure follows SOV: Vd cax'ai-lak (subject) - yalba-da (object) - t'cel-'a'y'ik yela-k-la (verb).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Tonkawa is subject-object-verb (SOV), as explicitly stated in the grammar and supported by multiple examples.",sov,sov
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1:** Mentions that the independent subject tends to precede all other syntactic elements in the clause except the sentence connective. This suggests a tendency for the subject to come first.
  
- **Paragraph 5:** States that the independent object will normally be placed just before the predicative word and that the independent object will normally follow the independent subject if both are expressed in the same clause. This indicates a typical SOV order.

- **Paragraph 13:** Reiterates that the independent subject tends to precede other elements and that the independent object normally follows the independent subject and precedes the predicative word. This further supports the SOV order.

- **Paragraph 15:** Discusses the flexibility of non-locative predicate modifiers but does not contradict the SOV order for the main syntactic elements.

- **Paragraph 19:** Provides examples of simple sentences where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the subject, aligning with an SOV structure.

From these observations, it is clear that the typical structure in Tunica places the subject first, followed by the object, and then the verb, indicating a dominant SOV word order.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can derive the dominant word order in Wappo by examining the syntactic structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 3** is particularly informative:
- ""The verb is always last except that occasionally nouns in the instrumental case follow it.""
- Example sentences:
  - ""pa't.a hu't'asi lelho'tsu mai'opo'nta"" (then coyote locked himself up in the hole of a rock)
  - ""pa't*a hu't'asi k'a'pe ha'ota"" (then coyote picked up the feathers)
  - ""tse'pi k-a'naci po'le ne'eke"" (he the Indian had a boy)
  - ""o'na eole'kuma make'kdta me'yu"" (again he threw the fish-line in the water)
  - ""tseka'li me'yu menata'ake"" (thus he got in the water)
  - ""ma"" a mewi'eski te""ti"" (still he held on with the string)
  - ""pa't-a me-'i tehotse'ta husa""oki"" (then the water was up to his neck)

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- The verb consistently appears at the end of the sentence.
- The subject typically precedes the object and the verb.

**Paragraph 4** provides additional support:
- ""They [personal pronouns] practically always appear before the verb, the pronominal subject preceding the object.""

**Paragraph 5** also mentions:
- ""Position plays a relatively small place in Wappo, most of the syntactical relations being expressed by suffixes, prefixes, and particles (post-positions).""

Despite the flexibility in syntactic relations due to morphological markers, the examples and descriptions provided indicate a consistent pattern where the verb is placed at the end of the sentence, and the subject precedes the object.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Ute,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ute, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the syntactical cases in Ute, mentioning the subjective case for subjects of non-subordinate verbs and the objective case for objects of transitive verbs. This indicates a distinction between subjects and objects but does not directly address their order relative to the verb.
   - **Paragraph 3**: Mentions the order of verbal elements but focuses on the internal structure of the verb rather than the order of subject, object, and verb in a clause.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb often appears at the end, such as ""sari 'tcL dro'"" (dog it-is), suggesting an SOV structure.
   - **Paragraph 6**: Contains examples like ""go ahead! go again and bring her this liver"" and ""let us two go in order to drink,"" which are imperative forms and do not clearly indicate the declarative sentence structure.
   - **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the use of substantive verbs and provides examples like ""cina'rjwav aru'a"" (coyote it-is), again suggesting an SOV structure.
   - **Paragraph 8**: Discusses enclitics and their positions but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 9**: Mentions noun incorporation and verb compounds but does not provide clear evidence of the dominant word order in declarative sentences.
   - **Paragraph 10**: Discusses combinations of enclitic pronouns and their order but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 11**: Mentions the expression of number in verbs but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 12**: Discusses combinations of enclitic pronouns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 13**: Discusses verb stems and their combinations but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 14**: Discusses compound nouns and their structure but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 15**: Discusses combinations of enclitic pronouns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 16**: Discusses noun-adjective compounds but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 17**: Discusses compound nouns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 18**: Discusses compound nouns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the order of verbal elements but focuses on the internal structure of the verb rather than the order of subject, object, and verb in a clause.
   - **Paragraph 20**: Discusses combinations of enclitic pronouns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

From the examples provided in Paragraphs 5 and 7, there is a pattern where the verb appears at the end of the sentence, suggesting an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order. This is further supported by the structure of sentences like ""sari 'tcL dro'"" (dog it-is) and ""cina'rjwav aru'a"" (coyote it-is).

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, the following points can be noted:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Yurok word order is flexible and that the order chosen by speakers may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than on purely syntactic rules. This suggests that there is no rigid word order.

2. **Paragraph 4** states that it is uncommon for a sentence in ordinary usage to have more than one noun, and it is common for sentences to have no nouns. When there is a noun, it may be positioned either before or after its verb. It also mentions that no more than one noun will be positioned before the verb, and any others will be positioned after the verb. This indicates variability in the positioning of nouns relative to the verb.

3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 6** provide examples of sentences where the position of adverbs and nouns can vary, further supporting the idea of flexible word order.

4. **Paragraph 18** defines nouns and their roles but does not provide specific information about a dominant word order.

From the information provided, it is clear that Yurok exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, with the position of nouns and verbs varying based on discourse factors such as emphasis and new versus old information. This flexibility suggests that there is no single dominant word order in Yurok.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar explicitly states that word order is flexible and dependent on discourse factors.
- Examples show variability in the positioning of nouns and verbs.
- There is no indication of a single word order being more frequent or dominant.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Nuuchahnulth,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3**: 
   - Example (180)c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees the baby.""
     - Structure: S V O
   - Example (180)d: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees him/her/it.""
     - Structure: S V O

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (182)a: ""j`QGr@O`Q KTbrl@j QTwVhChs"" translates to ""Woodpecker’s wife brought out her salmonberry dish.""
     - Structure: S V O
   - Example (182)c: ""B`wRhF`QQ@ XTpi@ Ji`krhb"" translates to ""Kwalisits too speared the whale.""
     - Structure: S V O

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (185)e: ""BhprhO`Q E`F`j IhlRr`bFh ji`sx@s"" translates to ""Kwatyat poured water into the boiling box.""
     - Structure: S V O

4. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (466)a: ""Qtojr@O`Q`G rTshK"" translates to ""I woke you.""
     - Structure: S V O
   - Example (466)b: ""Qtojr@O`QdFhb rHChK"" translates to ""You woke me.""
     - Structure: S V O

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example (196)a: ""p`Gr@O`Ql` Y@stRFh"" translates to ""He/she/it/they killed the deer.""
     - Structure: S V O
   - Example (196)b: ""ghm`otO`QpTvdFhm StGbjiH"" translates to ""The Ucluelets kept lifting up the (severed) heads.""
     - Structure: S V O

From these examples, it is evident that the structure of declarative sentences in Nuuchahnulth predominantly follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. The subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.

### Conclusion: SVO",no dominant order,svo
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Columbia-Wenatchi can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive, and the unmarked VOS for transitive clauses, noting that there is some freedom of word order as VSO constructions are also possible.""
2. **Paragraph 3** states that ""the basic transitive word order is VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order.""
3. **Paragraph 4** reinforces this by stating that ""the direct object ttw’it ‘boy’ appears immediately following the predicate and the subject kiy’dna? ‘girl’ is in final position. This represents the unmarked word order VOS.""
4. **Paragraph 6** also supports this by mentioning that ""VOS appears to be the unmarked order in the language.""

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while there is some flexibility in word order, the unmarked or basic word order for transitive clauses in Columbia-Wenatchi is VOS. This means that the verb typically comes first, followed by the object, and then the subject.

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Hidatsa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hidatsa, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 4** explicitly mentions that ""The unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons."" Here, A stands for Agent (which is equivalent to Subject in the context of transitive clauses), O stands for Object, and V stands for Verb. This indicates that the default or unmarked word order in Hidatsa is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).
   - **Paragraph 5** supports this by discussing the disambiguation of arguments in transitive clauses and providing examples that align with the SOV order. For instance, in the example (40a), ""Buusíhgees íìdahu ágsiac"" translates to ""The cat caught a mouse,"" where ""Buusíhgees"" (the cat) is the subject, ""íìdahu"" (mouse) is the object, and ""ágsiac"" (caught) is the verb, following the SOV order.
   - **Paragraph 19** also aligns with this by discussing the ergative case marking and providing examples where the ergative suffix identifies the agent (subject) and the unmarked form identifies the object, fitting into an SOV structure.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV

The evidence from the grammar indicates that the dominant word order in Hidatsa is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).",sov,sov
Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Toqabaqita by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the structure of verb phrases and mentions the position of direct objects relative to verbs and postverbal particles. It provides examples where the verb precedes the object:

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Momu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Momu, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of participants in a clause, indicating that the subject precedes the object(s), which in turn precede the predicate (verb). This suggests a subject-object-verb (SOV) order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V or simply verb-final. It also mentions that all participants in a clause typically occur before the verb, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides examples of transitive sentences where the subject precedes the object, and both precede the verb. For example:
   - (8.13a) ""Slupi took the things.""
   - (8.13b) ""Slupi feared the man.""
   - (8.13c) ""Slupi spoke to the man.""
   - (8.13d) ""Slupi shot the man dead.""
   These examples consistently follow the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of objects in ditransitive verbs, indicating that both objects occur after the subject and before the verb. This further supports the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides examples of bivalent clauses with transitive predicates, showing the subject, oblique-marked object, and verb in that order. For example:
   - (10.3a) ""Flerwick ate fish.""
   - (10.3b) ""I shot a pig.""
   - (10.3c) ""Flerwick was talking to Slupi.""
   These examples also follow the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph mentions that the neutral word order typically places the head (verb) in the clause-final position, which aligns with the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses serial verb constructions (SVCs) and mentions that in verb-final languages like Momu, the reduction of clauses produces a stack of verbs at the right edge of the clause, indicating a verb-final (SOV) structure.

8. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph states that Momu has a nominative-accusative system of agreement and that subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs, while objects are less so. It also mentions that predicates can be verbal or non-verbal, with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms, but transitive predicates are almost exclusively coded by verbs, reinforcing the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the basic constituent order in Makasae is SOV. It provides examples and explains that this order holds for both kinds of verb-phrase-internal arguments. The example given is:
   - (13) ... [asi-pada Timor]SUBJ [ani]OBJ [pase]PRED ... ‘… my fellow Timorese beat me…’

2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces this by mentioning that non-canonical word orders are relatively rare and that the overwhelming majority of clauses conform to the unmarked SOV word order.

3. **Paragraph 5** also states that the unmarked word order in the clause is SOV and that word order is the main device to indicate the grammatical role of an NP.

4. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the majority of sentences in Makasae follow the unmarked SOV word order, although it allows for left-dislocation of participants for pragmatic purposes.

5. **Paragraph 9** discusses the determination of grammatical roles and mentions that in a sequence of an NP and a transitive verb, the NP preceding the verb is generally interpreted as the verb’s object, which aligns with the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 15** again confirms that the majority of sentences in Makasae follow the unmarked SOV word order.

Given the consistent mention of SOV as the unmarked or basic word order in multiple paragraphs, it is clear that SOV is the dominant word order in Makasae.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Motuna, we can deduce the dominant word order by examining the syntactic structures and examples given.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a table of basic word orders and mentions that the choice between certain orders depends on which argument is the topic. It lists several possible orders: OAVP, AOVP, AOVP, OVP, AVP, and VP. This indicates that the language allows for flexibility in word order, but it does not specify a single dominant order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the cross-referencing of person and number in NPs and mentions that the ergative suffix marks the A argument. It implies that the word order can vary depending on the topicality and given/new information status of the arguments.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph categorizes noun phrases and their functions in clauses. It mentions that core arguments are obligatorily cross-referenced by pronominal markings on the verb, which suggests that the verb can appear in various positions relative to the subject and object.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph lists various tables and diagrams related to gender categories, case suffixes, and other morphological features. It does not provide specific information about the dominant word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph repeats examples of fully inflected non-medial verbs and discusses the cross-referencing of arguments. It mentions that verbs may take core noun phrases (S, A, or O), which are obligatorily cross-referenced, but it does not specify a dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph classifies words into major and minor word classes and describes their syntactic functions. It mentions that Motuna is predominantly agglutinative and that word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors. It lists SV, OAV, and AOV as commonly found constituent orders.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the order of adjectives and participles within noun phrases. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides examples of verb morphology and cross-referencing suffixes. It mentions that transitive verbs require two core arguments (O and A) and that the order of NP constituents and verbs is unmarked but can vary due to discourse factors.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides examples of subjects and objects in transitive clauses. It mentions that A NPs in absolutive case usually function as sentential topics, contrasting with those in ergative case.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph summarizes the core case markings and mentions that word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors. It lists SV, OAV, and AOV as commonly found constituent orders.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the order of adjectives and participles within noun phrases. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses rules of dearticulation and TAM and gender suffixes. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the order of post-head attributes in noun phrases. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

14. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses attributes within noun phrases and their order. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

15. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph lists gender suffixes and discusses the paradigms of verbs. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph provides an example of a relative clause modifying a noun phrase. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides examples of compounds and syntactic constructions. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides examples of nominal clauses and their structure. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides an overview of the language's morphology and syntax. It mentions that word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors and lists SV, OAV, and AOV as commonly found constituent orders.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the valency of verbs and their cross-referencing markings. It does not provide information about the dominant word order of clauses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, it appears that Motuna does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, the word order is flexible and determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors, with SV, OAV, and AOV being commonly found constituent orders.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can determine the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Basic Clause Structure**:
   - ""Basic clauses in Lavukaleve consist maximally of a predicate, which is the head of the clause, two core NPs (subject and object arguments of the predicate), and any number of adjuncts.""
   - ""The predicate is typically the final constituent of the clause.""
   - ""Core NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object.""

2. **Constituent Order**:
   - ""There is thus a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV.""
   - ""It was stated above that there was a fairly strict constituent order SV/AOV. This is for the most part true; if both subject and object NPs occur before the predicate, they must occur in that order, and usually the predicate is the final element of the sentence.""

3. **Examples**:
   - ""A textual example of a near-maximal clause: [Aka] [taragau na ne ruia la] [tail fi] [lovolori hi].""
   - ""In this example, there are two NPs; taragau na ne ruia la, the subject; and tail fi, the object (with a focus marker). The predicate is lovolori hi (with a focus marker).""

4. **Flexibility and Variations**:
   - ""However it is not unknown for one of the NPs, usually the subject NP, to appear after the predicate. If this does happen, there is almost always an intonation break between the predicate and the NP.""
   - ""Many such constructions seem to be repair constructions, in which the speaker, having omitted to mention the NP subject overtly, then wonders whether the hearer understood it properly, and adds it in as an afterthought.""

### Conclusion:
The dominant word order in Lavukaleve is **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**. This conclusion is based on the consistent description of the basic clause structure and constituent order provided in the grammar, which specifies that the subject and object precede the verb, with the subject preceding the object.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Dla (Menggwa),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dla (Menggwa), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 6** both indicate that clauses are predominantly verb-final. Specifically, Paragraph 3 states, ""When there are (pro)nominals in a clause, the verb is placed after all the (pro)nominals."" This suggests a tendency towards a verb-final structure. Paragraph 6 reinforces this by stating, ""Most clauses are verb-final, and the order amongst the free constituents (noun phrases and other words) before the verb is free.""

2. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** further support this by reiterating that clauses are usually verb-final, with the order of constituents before the verb being free. Paragraph 7 mentions, ""Clauses are most usually verb-final,"" and Paragraph 8 states, ""Clauses are predominantly verb-final.""

3. **Paragraph 11** provides examples where the verb follows the subject and object, such as in the sentence ""Hilari medicine drink-3MSG-PAST,"" which translates to ""Hilari took the medicine."" This example follows the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 14** discuss the grammatical relations and alignment in the language, but they do not directly address the word order of subject, object, and verb.

5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 19** discuss noun phrases and modifiers but do not provide information on the overall clause structure.

From the evidence provided, it is clear that the verb typically comes at the end of the clause, and the order of the subject and object before the verb is flexible. This suggests that the dominant word order in Dla (Menggwa) is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Duna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can infer the dominant word order of the language. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""In typical word order, subject argument NPs are clause-initial. Object NPs typically follow subject NPs.""
   - This suggests that the subject (S) comes first, followed by the object (O), and then the verb (V) comes last.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the identification of subjects and objects but does not provide additional information on word order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""An object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause. Fronting typically indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in some way.""
   - This indicates that while fronting (moving constituents to the front of the clause) is possible, it is marked and used for pragmatic reasons, not the typical order.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""Marked constructions typically involve movement of a phrase that is prominent in some way to the front or back of the clause.""
   - This further supports that deviations from the typical word order are pragmatically marked.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""In bivalent or trivalent clauses, the position of an oblique NP, PlcP or PP generally reflects the nature of its semantic role.""
   - This discusses the placement of oblique arguments but does not contradict the typical SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 8**:
   - ""The typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause is summarised in Figure 4.2.""
   - The figure and examples provided indicate that the subject precedes the object, which precedes the verb.

7. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Examples provided show the subject preceding the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""In each example the A argument NP precedes the P argument NP, and this exemplifies typical word order.""
   - This confirms that the subject (A argument) precedes the object (P argument), which precedes the verb.

9. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Examples provided show the subject preceding the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 17**:
    - ""Serialised verbs as noted in the textual data are always contiguous. Interposing an NP between the verbs was judged to be unacceptable.""
    - This indicates that verbs tend to stay together, supporting the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Duna is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Taulil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Taulil can be determined by examining the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The paragraph mentions ""Constituent order AVP ‘A’VPSVVSSV(S)P(S) use of NSPEC go in negation."" This suggests that the order of constituents can vary but does not provide a clear dominant order.

2. **Paragraph 5:**
   - Example (559) shows the structure of a verb complex and mentions that ""O/SO arguments, oblique arguments and adjuncts occur as post-VC elements."" This implies that the object and subject can follow the verb, suggesting a V-initial order.

3. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Example (51a) shows a transitive clause with the order ""da bokbok =a a-bət to kori a-pə∼vunə puikət,"" which translates to ""so that it will not be boiling vigorously, it forms the grease."" The order here is V (a-bət) - O (bokbok) - S (da).
   - Example (51b) shows an intransitive clause with the order ""doto voi idə-re nangə navonbət io iap o və-məto∼mətor konəng me və-t∼ton be boi da məle bətəpm =a iləm=a,"" which translates to ""When the river carried trees like that, he was sitting and looking at the river waiting for the flood to stop."" The order here is V (və-məto∼mətor) - S (iap).

4. **Paragraph 10:**
   - Example (68) shows a transitive clause with the order ""təre moli du ləm bəvon avar kəməron, to kori du-tuk vəvat, məte kori go idə-t∼tu udu, tove məgət o bə= də-mət =a mətmət mərek me i-t∼tu udu, bəvon o kori,"" which translates to ""It’s true that our life before is different, that we didn’t grow fat, like we didn’t grow fat, because now we eat good food, so we are growing fat, before no."" The order here is S (du) - V (tuk) - O (vəvat).

5. **Paragraph 11:**
   - The paragraph explicitly states, ""The basic order of clausal constituents is SVO, with split-intransitivity alignment.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit statement in Paragraph 11 and the examples provided in other paragraphs, the dominant word order in Taulil is **SVO**.

### Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can analyze the word order by examining the structure of the sentences given.

1. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (4-19b): ""Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun""
     - Translation: ""Sopak chopped firewood""
     - Structure: Subject (Sopak) - Object (firewood) - Verb (chopped)

2. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (5-1a): ""poŋgro""
     - Translation: ""they hit him""
     - Structure: Subject (they) - Object (him) - Verb (hit)

3. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Example (3-29): ""ŋayi yu tanun""
     - Translation: ""I saw you""
     - Structure: Subject (I) - Object (you) - Verb (saw)

4. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example (9-34a): ""Sopakyi Nik tatŋgɨn mbor pokunŋa""
     - Translation: ""Sopak saw Nik spearing the pig""
     - Structure: Subject (Sopak) - Object (Nik) - Verb (saw)

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example (5-6a): ""ewar ŋgɨgi ŋɨ poŋgro""
     - Translation: ""yesterday they hit him""
     - Structure: Subject (they) - Object (him) - Verb (hit)

6. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example (6-4b): ""ŋguyi nje tatukun""
     - Translation: ""she saw the dog""
     - Structure: Subject (she) - Object (dog) - Verb (saw)

From these examples, it is evident that the dominant word order in Taiap is consistently Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This pattern is observed across multiple instances where both the subject and the object are nouns, and the verb follows them.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Yimas,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Yimas can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the structure of Yimas clauses, emphasizing that the only obligatory constituent of a clause is the verb. It mentions that other constituents are arranged loosely around the verb with no obligatory order, although examples (6-184a,b) with verb-final word order are given as unmarked. However, it also states that verb-initial structures are perfectly grammatical but more marked pragmatically.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples where the word order is determined by the verbal prefixes, which indicate the grammatical relations of core nominals. It shows that the same sentence can have different meanings based on the verbal prefixes, not the order of the nouns. This suggests that word order is not rigidly fixed.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph states that the syntactic cohesion of sentences in all Lower Sepik languages, including Yimas, is remarkably loose, and word order is quite free, although the verb tends to occur finally.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the linear order of prefixes on transitive verbs, which is determined by a person hierarchy and a role hierarchy, further indicating that word order is flexible and not strictly fixed.

5. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides examples of noun and verb interactions, showing that word order can vary and is influenced by the pronominal affixes on the verb rather than a fixed syntactic structure.

6. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses the polysynthetic nature of Yimas, where complex ideas are expressed within single words, and the ordering of morphemes within these complexes is rigid, but the overall word order in clauses is not strictly fixed.

7. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph mentions that the word order of nouns in Yimas is free and does not signal their syntactic functions, which are indicated by the prefixes on the verb.

8. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in Yimas, with examples showing that different orders are possible and grammatical.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Yimas does not have a rigid word order. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of flexibility in the arrangement of subject, object, and verb, with the verb often tending to occur finally but not obligatorily so. The grammatical relations are primarily indicated by verbal prefixes rather than word order.

Maybrat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that ""the SVO word order in Maybrat is very rigid."" This is a strong indication that SVO is the dominant word order in Maybrat.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Examples provided in this paragraph show sentences with clear SVO structure:
   - (33) ""rae m-siar m-me ania"" translates to ""Many people fight with each other,"" where ""rae"" (people) is the subject, ""m-siar"" (fight) is the verb, and ""ania"" (each other) is the object.
   - (34) ""ana ø-sayim ania"" translates to ""They share it with each other,"" where ""ana"" (they) is the subject, ""ø-sayim"" (share) is the verb, and ""ania"" (each other) is the object.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in Maybrat is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), as evidenced by multiple explicit statements and examples in the provided paragraphs.",svo,svo
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, there is no direct information about the dominant word order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. The paragraphs mainly discuss morphological aspects, suffixes, and syntactical valence without providing clear examples or rules about the typical order of subject, object, and verb in sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 focus on the morphological structure, suffixes, and syntactical valence of verbs but do not provide explicit information on the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.
   - The information provided is more about the morphological processes, suffixes for subjects and objects, and the structure of verbal forms rather than the syntactic arrangement of S, O, and V in sentences.

Given the lack of explicit information on the dominant word order in the provided paragraphs, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order for Asmat from this data.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Kuot,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The paragraph mentions that Kuot is a predicate-initial language and explicitly states that Kuot is possibly unique among non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages in this respect. It also mentions that Kuot matches all the major features of a harmonic VSO language according to Greenberg’s word order universals.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of topicalization and fronting in Kuot. It mentions that either a subject or an object noun phrase may be fronted, but not both. The examples provided show that the verb typically comes first, followed by the subject or object.

3. **Paragraph 9**:
   - This paragraph discusses the use of demonstratives and their syntactic roles. It provides examples where the verb precedes the subject and object, reinforcing the predicate-initial structure.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - This paragraph describes the structure of clauses in Kuot, stating that the unmarked constituent order is predicate-initial with optional noun phrases for core arguments. It explicitly mentions the order as V (S) (O), where the subject and object are cross-referenced by affixes/enclitics on the verb.

5. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph further supports the predicate-initial structure by providing examples of clauses with relative clauses and questions. The examples show that the verb typically comes first, followed by the subject and object.

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - This paragraph discusses the use of adverbs and adverbial clitics, which attach to the first constituent of the phrase, typically the verb. This further supports the verb-initial structure.

7. **Paragraph 17**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of negation and the use of negative particles, showing that the verb typically comes first, followed by the subject and object.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, the dominant word order in Kuot is **VSO** (Verb-Subject-Object).

### Conclusion: VSO",vso,vso
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Imonda can be determined by examining the syntactic structure and the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the logical subject and object in sentences involving transitive verbs. It mentions that the logical subject of the transitive verb may not occur overtly, but does not provide clear examples of word order.

2. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph explicitly discusses word order within the clause. It states that ""there is only one constraint, namely the requirement for the verb to occur in final position."" This indicates that the verb (V) is consistently placed at the end of the sentence, which is a strong indicator of SOV or OSV order. The examples provided (e.g., ""ka pafeia suefe-i"" and ""ne-m ka lapi fe-f"") show the verb in the final position, supporting the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph provides examples of transitive verbs and their objects, such as ""sue la fire light"" and ""sue uekl fire make."" The structure again places the verb at the end, reinforcing the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences with verbs in the final position, such as ""p6l nghe -1 -rn uagl -f"" (I am going to build a fence) and ""n6 - 1 ul6 - 1 -rn a t uagl-n"" (he has gone planting seeds). These examples further support the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the syntactic structure of sentences and mentions that adverbial clauses often set the framework for the main predication. While it does not directly address the order of S, O, and V, it aligns with the overall pattern of verb-final sentences observed in other paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Imonda is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion:** SOV",no dominant order,sov
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit information about the dominant word order (SOV, SVO, VOS, VSO, OVS, OSV) in Nimboran. The paragraphs primarily discuss morphological categories, verb forms, and other grammatical aspects without directly addressing the syntactic structure of declarative sentences involving both subject and object nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses various grammatical categories and their order but does not mention sentence structure.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of infinitive forms but does not discuss sentence structure.

### Conclusion:
**Not mentioned in the grammar**",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Abun,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

   - **Paragraph 1:** This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order of an Abun clause is SUBJECT VERB OBJECT (SVO). It mentions that subjects are always the constituent realized by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the verb, and objects are always the constituent realized by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted.
   
   - **Paragraph 2:** This paragraph reinforces the SVO order by providing an example: ""Isak gwa 1PL,"" which translates to ""Isak hit us men."" Here, ""Isak"" (subject) precedes ""gwa"" (verb), which in turn precedes ""1PL"" (object).
   
   - **Paragraph 3:** This paragraph further supports the SVO order by stating that the subject is marked by word order as preverbal and the object as postverbal.
   
   - **Paragraph 5:** This paragraph mentions the rigid word order in Abun clauses and acceptable variations, but it does not contradict the SVO order.
   
   - **Paragraph 13:** This paragraph reiterates that the direct object in an Abun transitive clause is encoded by word order alone, always following the verb, which aligns with the SVO structure.

2. **Conclusion:** SVO

The evidence from the provided paragraphs consistently indicates that the dominant word order in Abun is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).",svo,svo
Meryam Mir,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Meryam Mir by examining the structure of transitive clauses where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** (Page 182):
   - ""Before examining clause types, it is worth briefly mentioning that word order tends to be A-O-V or S-V with local arguments either following or preceding the nucleus.""
   - Example (5.7): ""koskiride u ikris- Ii"" translates to ""(married) female-A coconutO scrape-Prlmpf"" ('The woman is scraping a coconut.')
   - Example (5.9): ""able neys nar miwsriyey"" translates to ""Det two boatO 3n SgO-drag up on shore-PfDual"" ('The two boats got dragged up.')

2. **Paragraph 19** (Abstract):
   - ""Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-O-V or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology.""

3. **Paragraph 7** (Page 186):
   - Example (5.39): ""koskiride lumi dikris-li uteb-ge"" translates to ""(married) female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe"" ('The woman is clearing her place.')
   - Example (5.41): ""koskiride neys uteb lumi da-rakris-i"" translates to ""(married) female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf"" ('The woman cleared two yards.')

4. **Paragraph 16** (Page 131):
   - Example (3.211): ""ka goroki iri-(i)"" translates to ""1SgA <EngO drink-Pf"" ('I drank grog.')
   - Example (3.220): ""ka able netat zyawali emarik-dari"" translates to ""1SgA Det one bookO send- PfSg"" ('I sent the one book.')

From these examples, it is evident that the typical word order in Meryam Mir for transitive clauses is A-O-V (Agent-Object-Verb), which corresponds to the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order when considering the subject and object as nouns.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Hatam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hatam, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the subject always precedes the predicate and that verbal predicates are always marked for the person-number of the subject. This implies that the subject typically comes before the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** also states that the basic word order is SVO, although objects may be fronted in certain contexts for emphasis or other pragmatic reasons.

3. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that the general clause formula in Hatam is SVO, with the subject preceding the predicate and the object following the verb.

4. **Paragraph 13** provides an example where the object is pre-posed, yielding an OV order, but this is noted as a marked or less common construction.

5. **Paragraph 20** explicitly states that Hatam is a ""rather strict SVO language,"" reinforcing the idea that the default or dominant word order is SVO.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS.""
   - This statement directly indicates that the dominant word order in Kwomtari is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and constituent order is SOV.""
   - This reinforces the information from Paragraph 5, confirming that the constituent order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Examples provided in this paragraph also support the SOV order:
     - ""Nali feta-lee-lu yesou-le pilu-le-fo-lee.""
       - Translation: ""He drew something he saw.""
       - Here, the subject (Nali) precedes the object (yesou-le pilu-le) and the verb (feta-lee-lu).

4. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples (24) and (25) show the verb ""remain"" (la) at the end of the sentence:
     - ""Lufwa are ite-i la-la-ne.""
       - Translation: ""Two men are in the house.""
       - Subject (Lufwa are) precedes the object (ite-i) and the verb (la-la-ne).

5. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Examples (1) and (2) show verbs taking suffixes to form complete verbs, with the verb appearing at the end:
     - ""Lufwa fie-fo-ne, 'Mare-na pe?'""
       - Translation: ""The men asked him, 'Is that true?'""
       - Subject (Lufwa) precedes the object (fo-ne) and the verb (fie).

6. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example (87) shows the verb ""come"" (ri-ne) at the end of the sentence:
     - ""Aite, Kevin, Jeffrey, Eric mwa, ri-ne.""
       - Translation: ""Girl (Laura-Lee), Kevin and Jeffrey, but not Eric, came.""
       - Subject (Aite, Kevin, Jeffrey, Eric) precedes the verb (ri-ne).

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Inanwatan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can analyze the word order in transitive clauses to determine the dominant word order. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that transitive clauses can have SOV or SVO order.
2. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of transitive clauses:
   - Example (4.9): ""Ni-a-weigo-re."" (I deceived you) - SOV
   - Example (4.10): ""Aoutourame-rf-we-be."" (They gave us their fish) - SVO
   - Example (4.11): ""Nf-taturi-dereni-tato-ereour-grandfather-and our-grandmother-and aq[romaqareforeleg hindleg mog6-we-rawe-re."" (My grandfather and grandmother carried up the foreleg and the hindleg) - SOV
   - Example (4.12): ""Ag6-waie-ra-qame-rabu-ego-imeduro ewai."" (And he had hidden her wings) - SVO

3. **Paragraph 15** mentions that SVO constituent order occurs in frequent variation with SOV order in Inanwatan clauses.

From these points, it is clear that both SOV and SVO orders are used in Inanwatan. However, the grammar does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that one order is more frequent or dominant over the other. Instead, it indicates that both orders are commonly used and occur in frequent variation.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Iau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - ""A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ se⁵."" (I am going to look at books.)
   - ""A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴."" (It would be good if I could look at books.)
   - ""Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴."" (It would be good if I could look at the books.)
   - ""Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ be⁸ bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ tv⁹."" (It was a cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.)
   - ""Y⁸ da⁶ se⁸ko⁸da⁷ o⁷ da⁸dv⁹ bau⁶ da⁸dv⁹ a⁵ ku⁸du⁸ be⁸sy⁹ y⁸ taui⁷ ba⁵."" (When we have finished school today, and when we have gone out, let's all go to work in the school teacher's garden.)

   These examples show that the verb consistently appears at the end of the clause, indicating a verb-final structure.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷ boe-8."" (I showed the people the book.)
   - ""Di⁹fe⁷ fe⁶ bv⁶ a⁷se⁹ a-9."" (I have already sown the seeds.)
   - ""Fy³ kav³ka⁹ a⁷se⁹ a-9."" (The top of the ironwood tree sprang back up into place.)
   - ""Tai⁷ a⁹ y⁸ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷ a⁹ bay-5."" (We gave the other leg (of pork) to some other people.)

   These examples reinforce the verb-final structure, with the verb appearing at the end of the clause.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""Iau is a SOV language so the clause nucleus is clause final.""

   This explicitly states that Iau is an SOV language.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""Da⁷ o⁸sy⁹ ty⁷ di⁸ to⁹."" (Someone killed my dog.)
   - ""Das⁷⁻⁸ be-8 di³."" (Das killed it.)

   These examples continue to show the verb at the end of the clause, supporting the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Benyamin be-8 da⁷ bv⁸ da⁸ tv-9?"" (It was cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.)

   Again, the verb appears at the end of the clause.

6. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""A⁹ av⁸be⁸ bui² i-7 se⁵."" (I am going to go quickly upstream.)
   - ""A⁹ tv⁹ sa³."" (I ate sago.)
   - ""Tv⁹ bv⁶ da⁹ y⁹."" (I ate up the sago.)
   - ""Au⁷ tv⁹ e⁹ ti⁴ to⁹."" (But he gave me sago!)

   These examples further confirm the verb-final structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Iau is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is drawn from multiple examples across different paragraphs, consistently showing the verb at the end of the clause.",no dominant order,sov

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the most standard word order in Sentani is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This is supported by the example provided:
   - ""Thus, the most standard word order is SOV.""

2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the unmarked word order is SOV, although it mentions that word order can be quite free depending on information structure. However, the default or unmarked order remains SOV:
   - ""Although the most unmarked word order is SOV, word order in Sentani is quite free...""

3. **Paragraph 11** confirms that the unmarked word order is SOV, despite the flexibility in the placement of non-verbal constituents:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""

4. **Paragraph 12** provides an example that follows the SOV order:
   - ""Onsá already saw me."" (Subject-Verb-Object)

5. **Paragraph 18** gives a summary that includes the statement about the unmarked word order being SOV:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV.""

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Sentani is SOV. This conclusion is drawn from multiple explicit mentions and examples provided in the grammar.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.""
2. **Paragraph 6** provides an example where the verb carries an object suffix, but it does not contradict the SVO order mentioned in Paragraph 1.
3. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss transitive verbs and their objects, but do not provide specific information that contradicts the SVO order.
4. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 14** discuss verb sequences and compound verbs, but again, do not provide specific information that contradicts the SVO order.
5. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the presentative and reflexivity, respectively, but do not provide specific information that contradicts the SVO order.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 1 and the lack of contradictory evidence in the other paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that the dominant word order in Mpur is SVO.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Mehek,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the placement of subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that both subject and object normally precede the verb, indicating an SOV order.
   - Example (14) supports this: ""nanda=r gana=r re eloko-m-r"" translates to ""The big brother told the little brother,"" where the subject ""nanda=r"" (the big brother) and the object ""gana=r"" (the little brother) precede the verb ""eloko-m-r"" (told).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It states that the default order is for the verb to occur at the end of clauses, reinforcing the SOV order.
   - Examples (5) to (8) show subjects occasionally following the verb, but this is described as a type of afterthought construction, not the default order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - The general structure of clauses is given as ""subject + (mood particle) + (direct object) + (indirect object) + verb,"" which aligns with SOV order.
   - Example (2) supports this: ""afa=r ka mini=r te nuwa-m-r"" translates to ""[Her] father gave her betelnut,"" where the subject ""afa=r"" (father) and the object ""mini=r"" (betelnut) precede the verb ""nuwa-m-r"" (gave).

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - It explicitly states that the basic word order of Mehek sign language follows that of spoken Mehek, i.e., SOV.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Examples (3) and (4) show subject pronouns usually preceding the verb, with object pronouns immediately preceding the verb, which is consistent with SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples (157) and (158) show compound verb constructions but do not contradict the SOV order for simple declarative sentences.

7. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (132) shows an adverb preceding the verb, with the subject preceding the adverb, consistent with SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Examples (47) and (48) show commands and statements, with the verb typically at the end in statements, consistent with SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (315) shows a compound noun phrase, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

10. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Example (348) shows a noun phrase structure, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

11. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Discusses clausal relationships and particles, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

12. **Paragraph 13**:
    - Examples (37) and (38) show direct and indirect objects, with the verb at the end, consistent with SOV order.

13. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Discusses complex sentences and relationships, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

14. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Examples (26) and (28) show subject pronouns usually preceding the verb, with object pronouns immediately preceding the verb, consistent with SOV order.

15. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Discusses verbal morphology, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

16. **Paragraph 17**:
    - Discusses questions, with the predicate typically last, consistent with SOV order.

17. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Discusses passive clauses, with the P (object) preceding the A (subject) in passives, but this does not contradict the SOV order for active declarative sentences.

18. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Discusses verbs and their inflections, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

19. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Discusses ideophonic adverbs, not directly relevant to SOV order but does not contradict it.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Abui:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that ""Stokhof claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent fronting is mentioned (1984:137)."" This directly indicates that the basic word order in Abui is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of sentences in Abui, such as:
   - (117) kawen ama mi bataa tukong
     - machete person take wood cut
     - ‘with machete one cuts wood’
   - (118) [ne-d-o,] na pa pi-afutahai yo
     - 1SG.LOC-hold-PNCT 1SG go.down.CNT 1PL.I.AL-fish search MD.AD
     - ‘me, I go down to look for our fish’

   In these examples, the structure follows the SOV order:
   - Subject (ama) - Object (bataa) - Verb (tukong)
   - Subject (1SG) - Object (fish) - Verb (search)

3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss noun phrases and modifiers but do not contradict the SOV order. They focus more on the structure within noun phrases rather than the overall sentence structure.

4. **Paragraph 13** provides additional examples of verb usage in sentences, reinforcing the SOV structure:
   - (120) kaaidi Fan Malei ha-bot
     - 1SG.PAT-pour name 3II.PAT-inform.CPL
     - ‘I ordered Fan Malei’

   Here, the structure is:
   - Subject (1SG) - Object (Fan Malei) - Verb (inform)

5. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss modifiers and question words, respectively, but do not provide direct evidence against the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Abui is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) by examining the syntactic structure of declarative sentences involving both a subject and an object as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the word order in Abu is ""subject-verb-object"" (SVO). It mentions that this ordering is obligatory and different from most Papuan languages, which typically have A-U-V or S-O-V ordering.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 by stating that Abu has a ""strict S-V-O grammatical word order."" This further confirms the dominant word order as SVO.

3. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides an example of a simple sentence in Abu: ""aleman ubahi-n-e-r-i n-a-ha bul kani walub,"" which translates to ""The big man killed a pig at the river."" The structure of this sentence is clearly SVO: ""The big man"" (subject) ""killed"" (verb) ""a pig"" (object).

4. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides another example of a transitive clause: ""kw-a-ha nubat,"" which translates to ""She hit/killed a dog."" Again, the structure follows the SVO order: ""She"" (subject) ""hit/killed"" (verb) ""a dog"" (object).

These paragraphs consistently indicate that the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) is SVO.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** states that ""Although SOY represents the unmarked order of core constituents in transitive verbal clauses, other configurations (i.e. OSV, SVO, OVS, VSO, VOS) also occur."" This indicates that while SOY is the default, other orders are possible due to pragmatic constraints.

2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that ""SOY is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause,"" but also mentions that ""OSY occurs when the object has pragmatic topic function and the subject pragmatic focus function.""

3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that ""SV I AOV is the default constituent order for Korafe verbal clauses,"" which aligns with the SOY order mentioned earlier.

4. **Paragraph 15** states that ""the unmarked order of constituents in Korafe verbal clauses is SOY,"" which is consistent with the previous observations.

5. **Paragraph 19** discusses that ""the object is topicalised and the subject given FOCUS function by assigning OSY order to the arguments,"" but this is a marked order used for specific pragmatic functions.

From these observations, it is clear that while Korafe allows for various word orders due to pragmatic reasons, the unmarked or default order is consistently described as SOY. This suggests that SOY is the dominant word order in Korafe.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Alamblak can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in ordering.""
2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces this by stating: ""The basic word order of a Two-place Clause is SOV; however, it is flexible.""
3. **Paragraph 7** mentions: ""Included there is a resumé of the general features of Alamblak, most of which are implied by its basic SOV word order.""
4. **Paragraph 14** also supports this by stating: ""Most general morpho-syntactic tendencies which are typically associated with SOV languages are exhibited in Alamblak.""

These paragraphs consistently describe the basic or dominant word order as SOV, despite acknowledging some flexibility in the ordering of constituents.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
I'saka,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states: ""The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOY, with Oblique participants (including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the verb."" This directly indicates that the dominant word order in I'saka is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions deviations from the word order but emphasizes that these are rare and pragmatically marked, reinforcing that the basic order is consistent.

3. **Paragraph 2** supports the notion of a strict word order in I'saka, further suggesting that the language has a dominant order.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the word order in interrogative clauses, which differs from declarative clauses, but this does not affect the determination of the dominant order in declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** provide additional context on syntax and noun phrase order, but they do not contradict the information given in Paragraph 3 about the basic declarative word order.

6. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 19** provide examples of sentence structures that align with the SOV order, further supporting the conclusion.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, the dominant word order in Urim can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Urim is a ""very consistent and rigid SVO-language."" It mentions that the position of the subject is very fixed and cannot be moved after the verb in most clause types. The object can be fronted for thematic reasons, but this does not change the basic SVO structure. The paragraph also discusses the lack of morphological case markings, which increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of noun phrases in the clause. This paragraph provides strong evidence that Urim has a dominant SVO word order.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the rigidity of the word order in Urim, stating that subjects almost always occur before the verb and objects can be fronted but this is rare. This supports the SVO structure as the dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses object fronting and provides examples where the object can occur in front of the subject or between the subject and verb. However, it also notes that this is rare and typically marked for thematic reasons, indicating that the basic word order remains SVO.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses semitransitive clauses and notes that the word order and functional structure of these clauses are similar to transitive clauses, with two obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb. This implies an SVO structure.

5. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph mentions that moving the subject after the verb is rare and typically occurs in certain clause types or topic constructions. This indicates that the basic word order is not affected and remains SVO.

6. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph provides examples of intransitive and transitive clauses, showing that the subject always occurs before the verb in intransitive clauses and that the subject and object occur before and after the verb, respectively, in transitive clauses. This supports the SVO structure.

7. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the criteria for determining basic clause types in Urim and mentions that the presence of a verb is a secondary criterion. It also notes that the subject referent is typically a volitional, controlling agent, which aligns with the SVO structure.

Overall, the evidence from these paragraphs strongly supports the conclusion that Urim has a dominant SVO word order.

### Conclusion: SVO",svo,svo
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the typical structure of declarative sentences involving both a subject (S) and an object (O) with a verb (V).

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the normal order in Abau is SOV: ""Example (36) displays normal SOV order: a topicalised subject and a non-topic marked object followed by the verb phrase.""
   
2. **Paragraph 3** reinforces this by stating: ""Default ordering of arguments is Subject Object Verb (SOV). This ordering frequently varies for pragmatic reasons.""

3. **Paragraph 4** also supports this by describing the neutral order: ""Neutral or frequently observed order within the clause places the subject before the object. The verb phrase occurs clause-finally.""

4. **Paragraph 5** mentions: ""The verbal clause always has a verb phrase which is the nucleus of the verbal clause. This clause type follows SOV order by default and displays the syntactic marking of subject and object.""

5. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 12** discuss the flexibility in word order for pragmatic reasons but consistently refer to SOV as the normal or most common order.

6. **Paragraph 16** provides a schema for sentence structure that aligns with SOV: ""This can be adopted for the Abau language to: P2 , P1 S O V , P3.""

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""The dominant word order of clauses of this type is: Predicate Subject Object Obliques...""
   - This suggests a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Examples:
     - ""Ha latchai i na’-ña i taotåo."" (VSO)
     - ""Ma na’påkpak kannai-ñiha i aodensia."" (VSO)
   - These examples reinforce the VSO order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""When it could be ambiguous which noun phrase of a transitive clause is the subject and which is the direct object, speakers often report that the subject must precede the direct object: in other words, the word order Predicate Subject Object is forced.""
   - This again suggests a VSO order.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Examples:
     - ""Ha dåggåo i bola guatu gi taotåo i patgun."" (VSO)
     - ""Ha tokcha’ i gatgantåk-ku i te’lang i guihan."" (VSO)
   - These examples also support the VSO order.

5. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""Chamorro is a predicate-first language. In neutral clauses...the predicate comes first, followed by its arguments.""
   - This indicates a Verb-first order, which aligns with VSO.

6. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Examples:
     - ""Ha apåpasi i lalåhi singku pesus si Carmen."" (VOS)
     - ""Ha apåpasisi Carmen i lalåhi singku pesus."" (VSO)
   - While VOS is also possible, VSO appears more frequently.

7. **Paragraph 14**:
   - ""Dominant word order of clauses formed from verbs or adjectives: x Negative TAM Predicate x Subject Object Obliques x""
   - This template confirms the VSO order.

8. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""Chamorro is a predicate-first language. When arguments do appear as independent constituents, they follow the predicate.""
   - This further supports a Verb-first order, consistent with VSO.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Chamorro is **VSO** (Verb-Subject-Object). 

**Conclusion: VSO**",vso,vso
Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It states that ""Awtuw's basic word order is readily identifiable as verb-final, indeed as SOV.""
   - This suggests that the dominant word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - The word order in reflexive clauses is rigidly S REFL (O) V, which supports the verb-final (SOV) structure.

3. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Examples of yes-no questions show various permutations of word order, indicating flexibility. However, this does not contradict the dominant SOV order in declarative sentences.

4. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples provided show a verb-final structure, such as ""rev d-ey-e"" (he came) and ""eywe m-alwo"" (the ancestor descended), which supports the verb-final (SOV) structure.

5. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Examples like ""tey rame(-re) du-puy'-a"" (she hit a man) and ""tey rame-re tawkway da-kow-o"" (she gave a man tobacco) show a verb-final structure, supporting SOV.

6. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Examples such as ""Yawu r yen-e symen-re kow-re"" (Yawur will give you the knife) and ""Ruwmay Yawur w-iy-re-re wan-e da-mak-e"" (Ruwmay told me that Yawur would go) also support a verb-final structure.

7. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Examples like ""rey reye rokra-kay"" (he has cooked food) and ""Peyaw yaw da-k-law-ey"" (Peyaw is baking a pig) further support the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Awtuw is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Mian,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the placement of subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (78): ""naka=e aal=e gò’-n-e=be"" translates to ""The man has cut the skin.""
     - S (man) O (skin) V (cut)
   - Example (81): ""naka=e mináan=o deilâ’-n-e=be"" translates to ""The man has removed his whiskers.""
     - S (man) O (whiskers) V (removed)
   - This paragraph indicates an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (91): ""naka=e unáng=o wa-têm’-Ø-e=be"" translates to ""The man saw the woman.""
     - S (man) O (woman) V (saw)
   - Example (92): ""unáng=o naka=e wa-têm’-Ø-e=be"" translates to ""The man has seen the woman.""
     - O (woman) S (man) V (saw)
   - The unmarked order is AOV (Agent-Object-Verb), which is essentially SOV. However, inversion is possible but less common.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (99): ""alél=o al=o gwel-ûb’-o-s-e=a"" translates to ""he cut out the bowels (of an animal) for the wife.""
     - A (he) R (wife) O (bowels) V (cut out)
   - Example (101): ""mak=i o-Øˆ-yen-s-ib=a"" translates to ""they give these (things) to the others.""
     - A (they) O (things) R (others) V (give)
   - The unmarked order in ditransitive clauses is A R O V, which aligns with SOV for monotransitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - States explicitly that the unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses, reinforcing the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Mentions that constituent order in relative clauses is no different from independent clauses, implying consistency in SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Reiterates that Mian is head-marking and has unmarked constituent orders of SV and AOV, further supporting SOV.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (213): ""no=i ya-l-êt-n-e=ta"" translates to ""he killed and brought/carried the marsupials.""
     - S (he) O (marsupials) V (killed and brought)
   - Example (214): ""ti=e báangkli=e deb-êt-n-o=a"" translates to ""she carried a báangkli adze.""
     - S (she) O (adze) V (carried)

   - Example (216): ""unáng=o baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le"" translates to ""and when he said to the woman.""
     - S (he) O (woman) V (said)
   - Example (217): ""unín=o dowôn’-Ø-i=a"" translates to ""I eat food.""
     - S (I) O (food) V (eat)
   - These examples continue to support SOV order.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (20): ""no=i ya-l-êt-n-e=ta"" translates to ""he killed and took the marsupials.""
     - S (he) O (marsupials) V (killed and took)
   - This example also follows SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Discusses the morphological complexity of verbs but does not provide new examples of constituent order.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Example (36): ""futbol pilai ke-b-io=be"" translates to ""They are playing football.""
      - S (they) O (football) V (playing)
    - This example is consistent with SOV order.

    - Discusses possessive constructions but does not provide new examples of constituent order.

13. **Paragraph 13**:
    - Example (14): ""no=i ya-l-êt-n-e=ta"" translates to ""he killed and took the marsupials.""
      - S (he) O (marsupials) V (killed and took)
    - This example supports SOV order.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Discusses adjectival modifiers but does not provide new examples of constituent order.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Example (114): ""sinanggwán=o ti=e unangmôn=o báangkli=e deb-êt-n-o=a"" translates to ""A long time ago, a woman took a báangkli adze.""

      - S (he) O (marsupials) V (killed and took)
    - This example supports SOV order.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Chácobo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chácobo, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that overtly-marked constructions allow SNV and the predicate to variably order, with predicate-S order appearing to be the default. This suggests some flexibility but indicates a preference for predicate-first constructions.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the verb phrase and indicates that the object noun phrase precedes the V̄-constituent in both fronted and non-fronted VP constructions. This suggests an OV order.

3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 7** highlight that the subject can occur in various positions (2, 7, and 16) and that the alignment can be neutral, allowing for variable ordering of A and P. However, in fronted-VP constructions, the object precedes the verb, and the subject follows the verb, indicating an OVS order in these cases.

4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples where the object precedes the verb and the subject follows the verb, reinforcing the OVS order in certain constructions.

5. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** further support the variability in constituent order, with examples showing objects preceding verbs and subjects following verbs.

6. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss the flexibility allowed by C-flexible constructions and the rigidity imposed by C-rigid constructions, indicating that the subject can follow the verb in C-rigid constructions, which aligns with an OVS order.

7. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** provide examples of APV and PAV orders, showing that there is variability but also a tendency for objects to precede verbs.

8. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss fronted-VP constructions where the object must occur directly before the verb, and the subject follows the verb, again indicating an OVS order in these constructions.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that Chácobo exhibits a flexible word order with a tendency towards OVS in certain constructions, particularly in fronted-VP and C-rigid constructions. However, there is significant variability, and no single order appears to dominate across all contexts.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can analyze the dominant word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph states that the formally least-marked pattern is verb-final and identifies the basic constituent order as AOV (Agent-Object-Verb), which aligns with SOV in terms of syntactic roles. It also mentions that the actual order of constituents is determined by pragmatics, with new information often fronted.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that AOV (SOV) is the most basic order in transitive clauses, especially when there are no other clues to the identity of the subject and object. It also mentions that in cases of ambiguity, speakers prefer AOV order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph supports the notion that verb-final order is basic in Hup, with an alternative order (verb preceding the subject) used in specific contexts, such as ongoing or currently relevant events. However, the verb-final order is considered more neutral and less marked.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph indicates that verb-final constituent order is the norm for events not currently in progress or for past-tense narrative and descriptive discourse, further supporting the dominance of verb-final order.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions that pronominal subjects almost always immediately precede the verb, resulting in a default OAV order, which aligns with SOV when considering full noun phrases.

6. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph explicitly states that Hup has a basically verb-final constituent order, best characterized as AOV (SOV), although the relative order of A and O is flexible.

7. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the prevalence of pronominal subjects preceding the verb, which suggests a tendency towards SOV order when considering full noun phrases.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while Hup exhibits flexibility in word order due to pragmatic factors, the dominant and least-marked order in declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Huambisa (Wampis) by examining the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions that the basic constituent order in Wampis is A P V (Agent-Patient-Verb), which corresponds to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
2. **Paragraph 2**: States that the canonical order of major clause elements in Wampis is Subject Object Verb (SOV).
3. **Paragraph 5**: Indicates that the most frequent word order in transitive constructions is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), although other orders are permitted in certain pragmatic environments.
4. **Paragraph 16**: Describes the ditransitive construction and mentions that the order of constituents in a ditransitive construction is A T V R (Agent-Theme-Verb-Recipient), which aligns with the SOV pattern.

These paragraphs consistently describe the dominant word order in Huambisa as SOV, with the subject preceding the object and the verb coming last. Although other orders are possible in specific pragmatic contexts, the dominant and most frequent order is clearly SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Cocama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Table 11.7 and the accompanying text indicate that 92% of transitive sentences display the SVO order, making it the overwhelmingly dominant pattern. The other orders, such as OSV and SOV, are much less frequent and are considered pragmatically marked.

2. **Paragraph 3**: The conclusion of this section reiterates that the unmarked focus structure typically displays the SVO order. This further supports the dominance of SVO in declarative sentences.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the allowable order patterns in tense-marked constructions, which include SVO. The SVO order is mentioned as one of the standard patterns, reinforcing its prevalence.

4. **Paragraph 6**: The pragmatically unmarked clause displays SVO order, and it is noted that circumstantial information does not occur between SV or VO, which aligns with the SVO structure.

5. **Paragraph 9**: Declarative clauses overwhelmingly exhibit the SVO pattern, which is considered the basic constituent order in the language.

6. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the basic clause structure and confirms that in non-progressive constructions, the subject precedes the verb and the object follows it, which is consistent with the SVO order.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the SVO order is the most frequent and pragmatically unmarked word order in Cocama, making it the dominant word order for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns.

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Tiriyo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiriyo, the following observations can be made regarding the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that word order in Tiriyo appears to be pragmatically oriented and that the 'unmarked' position is different for different clause types. It also notes a tendency towards OVA in habitual past and remote past clauses, but conjugated sentences do not follow this pattern.

2. **Paragraph 6** states that Tiriyo is a fairly typical Cariban language and mentions the presence of an OV verb phrase. However, it also highlights that the ordering of constituents is pragmatically determined, with topical elements tending to occur in initial position.

3. **Paragraph 7** reiterates that the ordering of constituents in simple sentences is pragmatically determined, with topical elements tending to occur in initial position.

4. **Paragraph 8** provides examples of sentences with different word orders:
   - (16a) An-V-O: ""pahko n-etaji-pawana"" (My father heard my friend)
   - (16b) A-O-V: ""pahko ji-pawana etal"" (My father heard my friend)

5. **Paragraph 11** discusses the positioning of noun phrases in remote past and imperative constructions, noting that objects are usually preverbal but can occur postverbally with a pause or adverbial separation.

6. **Paragraph 16** provides examples of sentences with different word orders:
   - (28a) A-V-O: ""ji-pawana n-ene weri"" (My friend has seen a/the woman)
   - (28f) O-A-V: ""wéri ji-pawana n-ene"" (My friend has seen a/the woman)

From these observations, it is clear that Tiriyo exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, with different orders being used in different contexts and clause types. The language does not seem to have a single dominant word order that is used consistently across all contexts.

**Reasoning:**
The evidence from the provided paragraphs indicates that Tiriyo does not adhere to a single dominant word order. Instead, the word order is pragmatically determined and varies depending on the clause type and context. This flexibility suggests that no one order is used more than twice as frequently as the others, and thus, Tiriyo lacks a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",ovs,no dominant order
Ticuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ticuna can be inferred from the following observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of indicative (ind) and subjunctive (sbjv-ʼü̃́) inflectional types in declarative main clauses but does not provide explicit examples of word order involving subject, object, and verb.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples of declarative main clauses and discusses the use of indicative and subjunctive forms. It mentions that the ordering of clauses in indicative does not affect the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to, implying some flexibility in word order. However, it does not explicitly state the dominant word order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the functional distribution of indicative and subjunctive inflectional types in declarative main clauses. It mentions that indicative is the default, unmarked inflectional type in declarative main clauses but does not provide explicit examples of word order.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of the use of subjunctive in polar questions and deontic modality but does not provide examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

5. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the use of indicative in non-declarative main clauses and dependent clauses but does not provide examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph provides examples of inflectional morphology but does not provide explicit examples of word order involving subject, object, and verb.

7. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the linker and its use in introducing NPs but does not provide examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

8. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses the zero-case form of NPs and provides examples of sentences with subjects and objects. It mentions that subjects always occur in the zero-case and that objects may be marked with the accusative case-marking suffix. However, it does not provide explicit examples of word order involving subject, object, and verb.

9. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the use of the linker in subordinate clauses but does not provide examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

10. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides a general introduction to the morphosyntax of the nominal phrase but does not provide explicit examples of word order involving subject, object, and verb.

11. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the inflectional template of the predicative phrase in indicative but does not provide explicit examples of word order involving subject, object, and verb.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of the dominant word order involving subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns. Therefore, the conclusion is:

**Conclusion: Not mentioned in the grammar**",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1:** This paragraph mentions that the constituent order in declarative clauses is usually of the AOV/SV type. It also notes that there is some flexibility, but the typical order is AOV for transitive clauses and SV for intransitive clauses.
  
- **Paragraph 4:** It states that the constituent order in transitive clauses follows the overall AOV tendency.

- **Paragraph 5:** It reiterates that the most frequent clause type is the declarative, and the constituent order of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type.

- **Paragraph 6:** This paragraph confirms that the typical constituent order is SV and AOV, where the S and A arguments are pre-posed to the clause-final predicate.

- **Paragraph 10:** It mentions that grammatical relations in Murui are shown by the order of core arguments in relation to the predicate: SV and AOV.

- **Paragraph 15:** It notes that in natural discourse, the AOV/SV constituent order in declarative clauses can be conditioned by pragmatic factors, but in dependent clauses, the constituent order appears to be rigid and verb-final.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Huitoto (Murui) is AOV for transitive clauses and SV for intransitive clauses. The flexibility mentioned does not detract from the overall tendency towards AOV/SV as the dominant order.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the basic word order as SVO, contrasting it with the marked SXV order. It provides examples showing SVO as the dominant pattern.
2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces that both SVO and SOV patterns are possible, but it does not explicitly state which is dominant.
3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph emphasizes that SVO word order appears very frequently in texts and is usually the word order that starts a discourse, suggesting that SVO is the dominant order.
4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the marked nature of SXV word order in various environments, further supporting the idea that SVO is the unmarked, and thus dominant, order.
5. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO and argues against SOV being the basic order.
6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph concludes that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO, based on a detailed study considering various factors such as animacy, definiteness, and phrase weight.
7. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph reiterates that SVO is the basic word order in Iquito, especially in realis mood, while SXV is used in irrealis mood.

The remaining paragraphs provide additional context but do not contradict the conclusion that SVO is the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Movima,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses various morphological features of Movima, including noun incorporation and the position of incorporated elements. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph is an index of topics covered in the grammar and does not contain specific information about word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides crucial information about Movima's clause structure. It states that Movima has a hierarchical alignment system where the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy as the second core argument (ARG2). It also mentions that word order is fixed but semantically determined, and that grammatical relations are indicated by direct or inverse voice marking on the verb. This suggests that the word order is not strictly SVO, SOV, etc., but rather depends on the animacy hierarchy and voice marking.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph is an index of topics and does not provide specific information about word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the marking of absolutive arguments and the use of clitics in Movima. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the distinction between structural and oblique case in Movima and provides examples of oblique arguments. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the structure of noun roots and their ability to constitute independent words. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides an overview of the structural characteristics of Movima, including its agglutinative nature and head-marking features. It mentions that Movima is syntactically fairly configurational and verb-initial, which suggests a V-initial word order but does not confirm a specific dominant word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses possessive constructions and the use of oblique constituents to encode possessors. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph compares Movima's features with typical Amazonian languages and mentions its configurational syntax and verb-initial nature. However, it does not confirm a specific dominant word order.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the encoding of possessors and the use of relative clauses. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses referential elements and their morphological properties. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph is a list of references and does not provide specific information about word order.

14. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph is the title page and acknowledgments of the grammar and does not provide specific information about word order.

15. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses question words and their syntactic behavior. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the use of the applicative suffix -e and provides examples of its use in clauses. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses argument incorporation and provides examples of incorporated arguments in clauses. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the use of demonstratives and their positional properties. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses phasal verbs and their morphological properties. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the use of the suffix -e in negative and subordinate clauses. It does not provide information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

Based on the information provided, particularly from Paragraph 3, it is clear that Movima's word order is semantically determined and influenced by the animacy hierarchy and voice marking. This suggests that Movima does not have a single dominant word order but rather a flexible word order that depends on these semantic and pragmatic factors.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Bora by examining the structure of sentences and the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (627): ""A vyéju u b é llffnajatéhi."" (The chief went to hunt.)
     - Structure: Subject (A vyéju) - Verb (u b é llffnajatéhi)
   - Example (628): ""M ftyan e m+amunaa tsaahi."" (Many people come.)
     - Structure: Subject (M ftyan e) - Verb (tsaahi)

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (654a): ""Tsuuca ó majchone."" (I have already eaten it.)
     - Structure: Subject (ó) - Verb (majchone)
   - Example (654b): ""Tsuuca ó fmfbajchoja."" (I have already fixed the house.)
     - Structure: Subject (ó) - Verb (fmfbajchoja)

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (209): ""o:?i:piè teï:né-?i."" (The dog runs.)
     - Structure: Subject (o:?i:piè) - Verb (teï:né-?i)

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (222): ""T sa ju co ob e oohnbye."" (The dog already came.)
     - Structure: Subject (T sa ju co) - Verb (oohnbye)

5. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example (229): ""A vyéju u b e ihajkimuke n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki."" (The chief told his people to fix his house.)
     - Structure: Subject (A vyéju) - Verb (ihajkimuke)

6. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Example (392): ""Tsahojts+meva wajpiïmu tsaahi."" (Five men come.)
     - Structure: Subject (Tsahojts+meva) - Verb (tsaahi)

From these examples, it is evident that the subject consistently precedes the verb in declarative sentences. The object, when present, follows the verb, as seen in the examples where objects are mentioned.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Wari',"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that in nonfinite clauses, the subject and/or object follows the verb, indicating a post-verbal position for both subject and object, which aligns with VOS order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph explicitly states that the pragmatically unmarked constituent order in Wari' is VOS. It also describes configurations where the verb is the first constituent, followed by the object and then the subject.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates that the most frequent constituent word order in Wari' is VOS. It also mentions that although the preferred order is object followed by subject, there are instances where the subject precedes the object, especially when there is no ambiguity.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph states that the basic order of constituents in a transitive/intransitive clause is verb, object, subject (VOS). It also notes that in ditransitive clauses, the order is verb, direct object, indirect object, subject.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph mentions that when both subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object, supporting the VOS order.

6. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph confirms that the basic order seems to be VOS, with an indirect object occurring between the direct object and the subject in ditransitive clauses.

7. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph notes a deviation from the normal VOS pattern when certain verbs like 'to exist' or 'to not exist' are used, where the subject usually precedes the object, indicating that VOS is the norm but can be altered in specific contexts.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Wari' is VOS (Verb-Object-Subject).

**Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Aymara (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, I will analyze the relevant information to determine the dominant word order.

### Analysis:

**Paragraph 1:**
- ""Mama Meriajjawichapanutape.g.give’ /ehm iri DON'siving-ri vero)+viisitizviyverb[mainclavselsarasqui.—'Sefiora Maria is going to visit her grandmother's house.""
  - This sentence structure suggests the subject ""Mama Meriajja"" (Señora Maria) is followed by the object ""wichapanutape"" (her grandmother's house) and then the verb ""visitizviy"" (visit).

**Paragraph 15:**
- ""Layeeutapar(u) 'I am goingto visit Pedro's house.’ Peczonvisitiriwsarase nta = NaysijutapPedronvisitiriwNayajjsareseta-dialoguenotes,LessonV for ciscussic 7 21 or Spanish influence.""
  - This sentence structure also suggests the subject ""Nayajjsareseta"" (I) is followed by the object ""Pedronvisitiriw"" (Pedro's house) and then the verb ""visitiriw"" (visit).

**Paragraph 16:**
- ""58a lot.'janit khech""aflgui? ‘yon't you have to irrigate?’ Note the shift of negative -ti from the verb to janiin negat ive interrogativa4now.!tensetucuyahia'towhosesubjectAspectreplaces'I havetheis(causeto)finish')isthesameasthatofthe maindeterminedbythatofthemainverb.infinitivefinished':theexpressthe notion of completion:khatita'cooked':ending.infix ~jji after e.g.""havinglurithe verbstem can""he did'/lurjjewa ""he did it all'passiveparticipleofkhatifiareplacingtheinfinitive10Aljamsaya‘sellthem'11sum _ufjaiia'totake'tocook'.""
  - This example includes a sentence where the subject ""I"" is followed by the object ""it"" and then the verb ""did.""

**Paragraph 20:**

  - This example includes a sentence where the subject ""I"" is followed by the object ""llamas"" and then the verb ""have.""

### Reasoning:
The examples provided in the paragraphs consistently show a pattern where the subject (S) precedes the object (O), which in turn precedes the verb (V). This pattern is indicative of an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can analyze the dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that simple declarative clauses with verbal predicates have the basic or unmarked word orders [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. This suggests that the typical structure for transitive clauses is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 3** states that both S and O have to come right before the verb when they are lexically realized. This reinforces the SOV order for transitive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 6** discusses the correlation between [SV] and [OV], indicating that these orders are prevalent and likely derived from nominalizations of verbs used in cleft constructions. This further supports the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 10** mentions that O occurs preverbally, otherwise a special morpheme (ke) appears after the verb. This indicates that the object typically precedes the verb, consistent with SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 19** provides examples where the object (O) and subject (A) appear before the verb (V), such as in the sentence ""hai-ts ka_in [Atawaka-@pa] marry"" (I ordered Atawaka to marry), which follows the SOV pattern.

6. **Paragraph 20** discusses attributive predicates and their word order but does not contradict the SOV order for verbal predicates.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Trumai for declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is **SOV**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Apinayé can be determined by examining the explicit mentions of word order and the examples given. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (80) shows an S-V order: ""nago kət=mə Ø-akr"" (water yet/still 3-cold) translates to ""The water has not cooled yet.""
   - This example is intransitive and does not provide direct evidence for transitive clauses with both subject and object nouns.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Discusses person marking and provides examples of finite and nonfinite verb forms, but does not explicitly mention the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive clauses.

3. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Provides examples of sequential actions and the use of the particle ""ri,"" but does not explicitly mention the order of subject, object, and verb in transitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Discusses the form of independent pronouns and their use in irrealis and realis clauses, but does not provide explicit examples of transitive clauses with both subject and object nouns.

5. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Mentions the structure of verbal clauses and the use of A, S, and O, but does not provide explicit examples of transitive clauses with both subject and object nouns.

6. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Discusses complex constructions and the use of subordination, parataxis, and serialization, but does not provide explicit examples of transitive clauses with both subject and object nouns.

7. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Discusses equative predicates and their structure, but does not provide explicit examples of transitive clauses with both subject and object nouns.

8. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Discusses relativization and provides examples of relative clauses. Example (6) shows the order of elements in a relative clause:
     - (6.a) ""pa na pa a-mə [muəj naj-are]"" (1 RLS 1 2-DAT DEM.DST RP-tell.NF) translates to ""I’m telling you about this one.""
     - (6.b) ""[ic-tə a-mə [bə naj-are] j-are ja]"" (1-ERG 2-DAT man RP-tell.NF RP-tell DEF.ART) translates to ""This man I’m telling you about lives in the other village.""
     - (6.c) ""[di tə cə-m ja]"" (woman RP-stand.NF DEF.ART) translates to ""This woman standing [there] had already told me about you.""
     - (6.d) ""[di [kət i-mə a-j-are cəwə ja]"" (woman 3.ERG 1-DAT 2-RP-tell.NF NMLZ.A DEF.ART) translates to ""This woman who told me about you has already left.""

9. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Explicitly mentions that ""The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful criterion of the identification of A and O.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit mention in Paragraph 4 that the SOV word order is fairly rigid in Apinayé, and the examples provided in other paragraphs that align with this structure, the dominant word order in Apinayé is **SOV**.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1:** States that the basic constituent order is VSO, with the possibility of fronting NPs (noun phrases) to the left of the verb under pragmatically marked conditions. This suggests that VSO is the default or unmarked order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2:** Mentions verb-initial order with free order of full NPs, and lists V-S-DO-Obl as a common structure. This supports the idea that the verb typically comes first, followed by the subject and then the object.

3. **Paragraph 4:** Explicitly states that Yagua is a VSO language and aligns with Hawkins' universal typology for VSO languages.

4. **Paragraph 5:** Reinforces the VSO order by discussing the separation of the verb from the subject and object, indicating that the verb typically precedes both.

5. **Paragraph 17:** Mentions the relative order of direct objects and obliques, reinforcing the VSO structure by placing the verb first, followed by the subject and then the object.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Yagua is VSO.

### Conclusion:
VSO",no dominant order,vso
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the information given about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly states that Kakua has a predominant preference for an SOV order of constituents.
   - Examples provided illustrate this order: 
     - ""the jaguar bit the dog"" (SOV)
     - ""I’m going to weave baskets"" (SOV)
     - ""Edgar gave a ball to Gabriel"" (SOOV)
   - It mentions that other orders are accepted but less preferred, with a clear acceptability scale: SOV > OSV > OVS > SVO > VSO > VOS.
   - The least accepted orders are VSO and OVS, indicating a strong preference for verb-final constructions.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Summarizes that Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
   - Reiterates that most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - States that Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Provides examples where the subject and object are overtly expressed, showing a preference for SOV order.
   - Example: ""the jaguar bit the dog"" (SOV).

5. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Mentions that in negative imperative clauses, the order of subject and object is inverted from the typical SOV basic order, resulting in OSV, which indicates that SOV is the basic order.

6. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Describes that most clause types prefer the basic SOV order of constituents.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Kakua has a strong preference for the SOV word order. This preference is consistently mentioned and illustrated with examples throughout the grammar.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can analyze the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text indicates that subjects (S) are generally post-verbal unless they are pragmatically marked (e.g., for emphasis or contrast).
   - Objects (O) do not show a clear preference for pre- or post-verbal positions.
   - Examples of different word orders are provided: VSO, VOS, SVO, OVS.
   - The verb often appears in the initial or second position in the clause.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The order of predicates and their arguments is flexible.
   - Overtly expressed subjects tend to be post-verbal unless they have special pragmatic status.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Word order is relatively free, with subjects most frequently appearing post-verbally and objects occurring on both sides of the verb with about equal frequency.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - There is a slight tendency for transitive subjects (A) to favor the post-verbal position, though this preference is weaker compared to intransitive subjects (S).

5. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Objects and subjects are overtly expressed in only a minority of clauses.
   - When expressed, subjects tend to be post-verbal, and objects do not show a clear preference for pre- or post-verbal positions.

6. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Extended intransitives and transitive verbs show a preference for post-verbal subjects.
   - Applied objects of extended intransitives show a slight preference for the post-verbal position.

7. **Paragraph 11**:
   - The language is head-marking, with subjects and objects marked on the verb.

8. **Paragraph 12**:
   - The language has both head-marking and dependent-marking characteristics, with core grammatical relations marked on the verb.

From the analysis, it is clear that Yuracare exhibits a flexible word order with a tendency for the verb to appear in the initial or second position. Subjects are often post-verbal unless pragmatically marked, and objects can appear on either side of the verb. The examples provided show various word orders, but there is no single dominant order that is more than twice as frequent as the others.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Kuna can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 3** both explicitly state that the normal word order in Kuna is subject, object, predicate (SOV). For example, Paragraph 1 provides the sentence ""An ogob kumpi"" (I coconut eat-want-to), which follows the SOV order. Similarly, Paragraph 3 gives the example ""Omedin we mol pakcha"" (The woman bought that blouse), which also follows the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 8** mentions that the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate, which aligns with the SOV structure for transitive sentences.

3. **Paragraph 18** discusses the position of the indirect object in transitive sentences, stating that it usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb, further supporting the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 12** discuss the postpredicate position for emphasis or clarification, but they do not contradict the basic SOV order for declarative sentences.

5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 16** mention that additional information or indirect objects follow the normal word order, which is consistent with the SOV structure.

Overall, the evidence from multiple paragraphs consistently points to the SOV order as the dominant word order in Kuna.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Uru,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Uru can be inferred from several key points:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that word order in declarative clauses does not differ from the most common types found, specifically listing SOV, SV, or OV. This suggests a preference for SOV order among others.

2. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states that the word order of complement clauses is SOV, OV, or SV, with the complement preceding the matrix verb. This reinforces the tendency for the verb to appear at the end of the clause.

3. **Paragraph 7** notes that Uchumataqu (another name for Uru) has a strong tendency to place the verb at the end of a clause, which aligns with SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 10** clearly states that the basic word order in declarative clauses is SOV, as supported by multiple sources (Uhle 1894, Torero 2002).

5. **Paragraph 16** discusses various word orders but emphasizes that SOV and OSV are the most common in imperative clauses, with SOV being a significant part of the language's structure.

6. **Paragraph 18** provides an example of a declarative clause with SOV order: ""kuas(i) lik-s-n-u-cay wir-ki"" ('I drink water').

These points collectively indicate that while Uru allows for some flexibility in word order, the dominant and most common order in declarative sentences is SOV.

### Conclusion:

### Conclusion: SVO",no dominant order,svo
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, several key points indicate the dominant word order of the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the basic OSV (Object-Subject-Verb) order in Warao. It mentions that variations from the basic OSV order occur due to discourse environment, focus fronting, and other pragmatic factors. The examples provided, such as ""Diego said this to me"" (OSV) and ""A snake bit Henry"" (OSV), support the claim that OSV is the basic order.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the OSV hypothesis by stating that Warao comparatives arrange the standards of comparison before the topics of comparison, which aligns with the OSV order. It also mentions that verb suffixes associated with aspect/tense are common in verb-final languages, further supporting the verb-final characteristic of Warao.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides additional examples of OSV order in Warao, such as ""The chief advised me"" (OSV) and ""John comes to see us"" (OSV). It also discusses the use of indirect objects and obliques, which are consistent with the OSV structure.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the order of constituents in the basic simplex sentence, providing examples of intransitive and transitive sentences. It states that Warao is solidly verb-final and that the entity affected or moved within the sentence precedes the agent, which aligns with the OSV order.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the placement of subjects and objects in Warao, noting that subjects are not case-marked and are resistant to deletion. It provides examples of direct and indirect objects, which are consistent with the OSV order.

6. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the use of subjective and objective pronouns in Warao, providing examples that align with the OSV order. It also mentions that subjective pronouns are preverbal items, further supporting the verb-final characteristic of Warao.

7. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the formation of yes/no questions and information questions in Warao. It mentions that interrogative pronouns are sentence-initial, but the basic order of constituents remains OSV.

### Conclusion:
**OSV**",osv,osv
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cuiba, let's analyze the information to determine the dominant word order.

### Analysis

**Paragraph 1:**
- This paragraph mentions that the order of tagmemes is generally free, with some exceptions. Specifically, it states that the predicate (+P) often occurs clause-finally, but may be followed by the subject (+S) and object (+O). This suggests some flexibility in word order but hints at a possible SOV structure when +P is clause-final.

**Paragraph 5:**
- This paragraph provides examples of noun phrases and compounding of nouns but does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

**Paragraph 7:**
- This paragraph discusses clitics and their attachment to noun stems, but it does not provide information about the order of subject, object, and verb in sentences.

**Paragraph 13:**
- This paragraph gives examples of verb groups and clitics but does not provide clear information about the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

### Reasoning

The most relevant information comes from Paragraph 1, which indicates that the predicate (+P) often occurs clause-finally. This suggests that the verb tends to be placed at the end of the clause, which is characteristic of an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order. Although the paragraph mentions that the order is generally free, the high frequency of the clause-final predicate implies a dominant SOV order.

### Conclusion

Based on the information provided, the dominant word order in Cuiba appears to be:

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the frequency and acceptability of different word orders in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph provides examples of various word orders: SOV, OSV, SVO, OVS, and VOS. It explicitly states that VSO is not acceptable.
   - It mentions that VOS and VSO are not attested in text material, while VO and VS are.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Table 5 shows a strong preference for pre-verbal subjects (91%).
   - Table 6 shows a preference for post-verbal objects (60%).
   - Table 7 summarizes that clauses with co-occurring subjects and objects are rare (8%), and among these, SV-oO (SVO) is the most frequent type (77%).

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph discusses the interpretation of OSV as not being a default constituent order, suggesting that constituent order patterns are motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors rather than a fixed syntactic structure.

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - It confirms that VSO is ungrammatical and that SOV is extremely rare in text material, although some speakers accept it in elicitation.

5. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph states that Apurinã is predominantly OV in terms of word order correlations, but the most frequent order in text is VO.

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - It mentions that no clear-cut association has been established between discourse-pragmatic factors and constituent order, suggesting variability in word order.

7. **Paragraph 17**:
   - It describes the structure of clauses with transitive verbs, showing various possible orders but emphasizing the presence of coreferential pronominal markers when subjects or objects are post-verbal.

8. **Paragraph 18**:
   - It discusses the distribution of pronominal markers and the optionality of post-verbal subject/object NPs, indicating flexibility in word order.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Apurinã appears to be **SVO**. This conclusion is supported by the frequency data in Paragraph 3, which shows that SVO is the most frequent order among clauses with co-occurring subjects and objects, and the overall preference for pre-verbal subjects and post-verbal objects.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Kadiwéu can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** both indicate that Kadiwéu exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order. Specifically, Paragraph 2 mentions that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO but is predominantly SVO. It also lists all possible orders: OVS, VOS, SOV, OSV, SVO, and VSO. Paragraph 3 reiterates this flexibility and notes that the high frequency of SVO order in Griffiths' publications seems to be biased by elicitation techniques.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the constituent order of subordinate clauses is always VSO, but this does not directly impact the dominant order of main clauses.

3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** provide additional context about the use of OSV and OVS orders, noting that these are avoided in isolated sentences to prevent ambiguity but are used when the context clarifies the roles of the subject and object.

4. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 10** further support the notion of free word order, emphasizing that nominal phrases are usually absent and can be freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb.

5. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 20** highlight the nonconfigurational nature of Kadiwéu, where nominal phrases can be omitted, freely ordered, and discontinuous expressions are allowed.

Given this information, it is clear that Kadiwéu does not have a rigid word order and allows for significant flexibility. However, the repeated mention of SVO as a common order suggests that while the language is highly flexible, SVO might be slightly more frequent in usage.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Karajá can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language."" This is a direct statement about the word order of the language, indicating that the subject (S) comes first, followed by the object (O), and then the verb (V).

2. **Paragraph 5** reinforces this by mentioning that ""Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the verb, vowel harmony can take place between the verb and the object."" This further supports the SOV order by discussing the syntactic relationship between the object and the verb.

3. **Paragraph 13** provides examples of relative clauses and their structure, which align with the SOV order. For instance, the example ""Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-e"" (White 3-CTPT-INTR-go.ashoreèCTPT-IMPRF) shows the verb at the end of the clause, consistent with SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 19** discusses the structure of relative clauses and mentions that ""the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1) and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress."" The examples provided also show the verb at the end, consistent with SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 16** discusses the antipassive construction and provides examples that align with the SOV order, such as ""ha)bu ∅-r-O-Î-ukaèr-ErI"" (man 3-CTFG-ANTI-3/REL-split=CTFG-PROGR), where the verb appears at the end.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
