Supyire,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Supyire can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences, particularly those involving both a subject (S) and an object (O) as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that the basic word order in simple clauses is subject—predicate. However, it does not specify the position of the verb (V) relative to the object (O).

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes the word order in Senufo languages, including Supyire, as having the direct object before the verb and all indirect objects after the verb. This suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order for direct objects.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates that the word order in Supyire places the direct object before the verb, aligning with the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph provides examples of verbal clauses, showing that the direct object is placed between the auxiliary and the verb, which supports the SOV order:
   - Example: ""Unmha suroshwoho"" (she HAB mush cook) translates to ""She cooks mush,"" where ""suroshwoho"" (mush) is the object preceding the verb ""cook.""

5. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph states that subjects and direct objects are easily distinguishable by their fixed positions in the sentence, reinforcing the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 21**: This paragraph discusses passive constructions and mentions that intransitive clauses with a patient subject and a normally transitive verb must be passive, implying that the direct object typically precedes the verb in active constructions.

7. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph lists the contents of the grammar, which includes sections on word order and transitivity, further supporting the SOV structure.

8. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph discusses questions and mentions that constituent questions in Supyire often use cleft focus constructions, where the question word or noun phrase is fronted, followed by the rest of the clause. This does not directly impact the basic word order but aligns with the SOV structure in declarative sentences.

9. **Paragraph 32**: This paragraph mentions that transitive verbs in Supyire typically take a direct object, and the intransitive use of these verbs often has a passive meaning, again supporting the SOV order.

10. **Paragraph 33**: This paragraph provides examples of constituent questions, showing that the direct object can be questioned and fronted, but in declarative sentences, it typically precedes the verb.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Supyire is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on multiple references indicating that the direct object precedes the verb in declarative sentences.",sov,sov

Ma'di,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Ma'di by analyzing the relevant information about the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that the Lokai dialect of Ma'di has a mixed word order, partly SVO and partly SOV, while the 'Burulo dialect is SVO.
   - This indicates that there is some variability in word order within different dialects of Ma'di, but SVO is a significant pattern.

2. **Paragraph 14**:
   - It states that in the 'Burulo dialect, the word order is verb-object when the verb is inflected (nonpast).
   - This suggests that in at least one dialect of Ma'di, the verb precedes the object in certain contexts, which aligns with SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 20**:
   - It describes the structure of sentences with inflected, uninflected, and directive verbs. Specifically, it mentions that the inflected verb is preceded by its object or takes an object clitic, while the uninflected verb (or directive verb) is followed by its object.
   - This indicates that the object can either precede or follow the verb, depending on the verb form, which again suggests some variability but with a tendency towards SVO.

4. **Paragraph 23**:
   - It provides an example where the subject precedes the object, which in turn precedes the inflected verb: ""ma eßl para IS fish N-eat AFF"" (I will certainly eat fish).
   - This example clearly shows an SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 24**:
   - It discusses the focus on preverbal objects and mentions that a wh-phrase can appear in the preverbal position, suggesting that objects can precede verbs in focus contexts.
   - This indicates that while SVO might be common, there are contexts where other orders (like OSV) are used for focus.

6. **Paragraph 39**:
   - It states that in the 'Burulo dialect, the object never precedes the inflected verb, implying a consistent SVO order in this dialect.

### Conclusion:
Given the information from the paragraphs, the dominant word order in Ma'di appears to be **SVO**. This conclusion is based on the frequent mention of SVO order in both the Lokai and 'Burulo dialects, as well as the provided examples and descriptions of sentence structures.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Bangime,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, the dominant word order can be determined by analyzing the frequency and context of the different word orders mentioned.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph states that the word order in Bangime changes depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the phrase. The attested word orders are SVO, SOV, and OSV. Specifically, the incompletive aspects are usually SVO, the completive aspects SOV, and the future can be expressed with OSV word order. This indicates that there is no single dominant word order across all contexts, but rather different orders are dominant in different contexts.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reiterates that the incompletive categories are usually in SOV order, the completed categories are SVO, and the future tense may be either SOV or OSV. It also mentions that some verbs may deviate from the default word order to indicate topicalization.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The analysis of the paragraphs indicates that Bangime does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, the word order varies significantly depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. The language exhibits flexibility in word order, with SVO, SOV, and OSV orders being used in different contexts. Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that Bangime lacks a dominant word order.",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples of transitive clauses where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (10.71): ""dua d-a-lígít tʃogwá-arabía"" (child rolled tire)
     - Order: S V O
   - Example (10.72): ""dogwaaŋá b-a-sa-gá gazíá"" (donkey ate grass)
     - Order: S V O
   - Example (10.73): ""áχó sáŋâ d-a-gam"" (He found salt)
     - Order: S O V
   - Example (10.74): ""ŋ́gafa duu-má b-a-fag-agá-kʼw"" (woman raised her child)
     - Order: S O V
   - Example (10.75): ""mátsʼá d-a-sá-kʼʷ á-manɟa"" (house consumed by fire)
     - Order: O V S
   - Example (10.76): ""ɟá b-a-tsʼii-gá-kʼw á-ziba"" (tree broken by wind)
     - Order: O V S
   - Example (10.77): ""d-a-ŋar-ákʼw=gwê á-mááχó duú-ma"" (And he took my child)
     - Order: V S O

2. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (12.50a): ""ɓaga d-a-ɓátʃ ŋ́gafa"" (person hit woman)
     - Order: S V O
   - Example (12.50b): ""ɓaga l-á-ɓátʃ ŋ́gafa"" (person that hit woman)
     - Order: S V O

3. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Example (12.51): ""kʼwatʼa l-á-ɓátʃ-a óó-báámítá=tso"" (the one who hit the chair is Bamita)
     - Order: O V S

4. **Paragraph 46**:
   - Example (12.69): ""etá-l-á-n̩-ʃá-á-cá mambráátá=tso"" (What went out was the light)
     - Order: S V O
   - Example (12.70): ""etá-l-á-ɗú-áá-tsa óó-báámítá"" (The one who is sick is Bamita)
     - Order: S V O

From these examples, we observe that multiple word orders are attested in Gumuz, including SVO, SOV, OVS, and VSO. However, the most frequently occurring orders in the provided examples are SVO and SOV. Given the variety of orders and the lack of a single dominant pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that Gumuz does not have a single dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
No dominant order",svo,no dominant order
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can determine the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""KCh and DjCh show S-MAN-V-X constituent order (subject, mood-aspect-negation, verb, other elements including direct object)...""
   - This suggests that the subject precedes the verb, and the verb precedes the object, indicating an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""The basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object)...""
   - This explicitly states that the basic word order is SVO.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""The distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order. Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct objects and PPs.""
   - This reinforces the SVO order, where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The syntactic order is subject + verb + object as in English.""
   - This again confirms the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Perception predicates, as in English, have a subject NP representing the perceiver and a direct object representing the perceived object or its sensory emanation.""
   - This implies a subject-verb-object structure similar to English.

6. **Paragraph 8**:
   - ""The cliticization analysis is useful in accounting for pronominal morphology as well as constituent order. In (438) we have an instance of 3SgO ga, which differs in form from a short 3Sg allomorph a. The longer ga is used in direct object function, in which case it immediately follows the verb...""
   - This suggests that the object follows the verb, supporting the SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""The ordering of postverbal constituents appears to be much as in KCh, with pronominal objects coming first, then pronominal adpositional phrases, then definite (or otherwise 'old') NPs, then indefinite NPs.""
   - This indicates that objects follow the verb, consistent with SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""The ordering of postverbal constituents is basically determined by two main factors. First, certain types of constituents must occur at or near the end of the clause...""
   - This supports the idea that objects follow the verb, aligning with SVO order.

9. **Paragraph 11**:
   - ""Noun-verb compounds are rare, but they are easy to spot on grounds of word order (N-V)...""
   - This does not directly address SVO but does not contradict it either.

10. **Paragraph 12**:
    - ""Stress is nonphonemic, with neither lexical nor grammatical significance, in the analysis and transcription used here...""
    - This paragraph does not provide information on word order.

11. **Paragraph 13**:
    - ""nin 'drink', qaa 'eat', and bey 'know' are transitive verbs: qaa ga 'eat it' (with 3SgO g ). The direct object is often omitted as in English...""
    - This suggests that the object follows the verb, consistent with SVO order.

12. **Paragraph 14**:
    - ""The postpositions (ra, ga, wane, kuna) follow nin Only' in (132a), moo 'also' in (132b), weak Emph yaa in (132c), and Emph daa in (132d)...""
    - This does not directly address word order but does not contradict SVO.

13. **Paragraph 15**:
    - ""Recursion occurs when the first-order possessor NP itself contains a (second-order) possessor...""
    - This paragraph does not provide information on word order.

14. **Paragraph 16**:
    - ""It is much easier to conjoin two full NPs (i.e. any NPs other than personal pronouns) with nda, since the microsyntactic rules affecting pronominal conjunction do not apply...""
    - This does not directly address word order but does not contradict SVO.

15. **Paragraph 17**:
    - ""The parsing of Xna ci Υ nono is tricky. One possibility is to take is as a single clause, with ci as the basic verb and nono as a kind of redundant, nonclausal supplement...""
    - This does not directly address word order but does not contradict SVO.

16. **Paragraph 18**:
    - ""The pattern by which an antecedent NP binds the possessor of another NP to its right is relevant not only when the antecedent is a subject NP but also within NP conjunctions...""
    - This does not directly address word order but does not contradict SVO.

17. **Paragraph 19**:
    - ""Songhay is often described loosely as a 'language,' but in fact it is a large complex of varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages...""
    - This does not provide information on word order.

18. **Paragraph 20**:

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and statements regarding the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""While the basic word order is SVO, there is a second word order structure in all dialects, namely SOV, when specific matrix verbs taking either nominal or verbal complements are involved.""
   - This indicates that SVO is considered the basic or dominant word order, although SOV is also used in specific contexts.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""As table 7-1 shows, the basic word order is subject—verb—object (SVO), irrespective of whether pronominal or nominal participants are involved.""
   - This reinforces the idea that SVO is the basic word order in !Xun.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""What is common to all dialects is that TAM (tense—aspect—modality) markers and negation are placed between subject and verb, that the object follows the verb, and that the question marker is placed before the verb phrase.""
   - This description aligns with an SVO word order, where the object follows the verb.

4. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""The subject (a pronoun) precedes the verb while the object follows it, the negation marker (NEG) is placed between subject and verb, and there is no inflectional morphology involved.""
   - This again supports the SVO word order.

5. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""tanthéffhmandthenleopard PASTkénladpohotreat.welljackal‘... and then the leopard treated the jackal well ....’""
   - This example sentence follows the SVO structure.

6. **Paragraph 8**:
   - ""The basic word order is head—dependent and subject-verb—object, although there is a minor ae exhibiting dependent—head and object-verb word order.""
   - This confirms that the dominant word order is SVO, with some minor variations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in !Xun (Ekoka) is **SVO**.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Ijo (Kolokuma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can infer the dominant word order of Ijo (Kolokuma) by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key observations from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""In word-order, modifiers consistently precede heads and the object precedes the verb.""
   - This suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order since the object precedes the verb.

2. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Examples of passive constructions show the object preceding the verb in the active sentences:
     - ""igere, ere-ma kQri-mi"" (crocodile woman T catch Spa) translates to ""a crocodile caught the woman.""
     - ""tykpa-bj, kjmi, ton[-mi"" (lamp T man light Spa) translates to ""the lamp was lighted by someone.""
   - These examples support the SOV structure in active sentences.

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - ""irap, ingo deri, pit$-mj"" (she trap weave set Spa) translates to ""she wove a trap and then set it.""
   - ""eri, weni-da, ami syp-mi"" (he walk and town enter Spa) translates to ""he walked and then entered a town.""
   - These examples also follow the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 14**:
   - ""eri, am&so?-mi"" (he town enter Spa) translates to ""he went to town.""
   - ""eri, wo bina 6wei-mp, b6-mi"" (he his relative man with come Spa) translates to ""he came with his relative.""
   - These examples further confirm the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 29**:
   - ""arj, tjn-bj thumo-mi"" (I stick T bend Spa) translates to ""I bent the stick.""
   - ""tjn-bi, toi-mi"" (stick T bend st StPr) translates to ""the stick is bent.""
   - Again, the object precedes the verb, indicating SOV order.

### Conclusion:

### Conclusion: SVO

The dominant word order in Emai is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). This conclusion is based on multiple examples from the descriptive grammar that consistently show this order in declarative sentences.",svo,svo
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, the dominant word order in Ik can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences involving both a subject (S) and an object (O) with a verb (V).

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses.
   - Example: ""Atsʼa ŋoka oka."" (The dog gnaws a bone.)
     - V (gnaw) S (dog) O (bone)

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The order of subject and object cannot be reversed, indicating a fixed order.
   - Example: ""Cea ama idemek."" (A person kills a snake.)
     - V (kill) S (person) O (snake)

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Subordinate clauses have an SVO order.
   - Example: ""Noo ŋokia epad,..."" (When the dog was sleeping,...)
     - S (dog) V (sleep)

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Auxiliary verb constructions have Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O order, similar to subordinate clauses.
   - Example: ""Atsʼa noo ŋoka oka."" (The dog gnawed the bone a while ago.)
     - V (gnaw) S (dog) O (bone)

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Complement clauses retain the VSO order of non-embedded main clauses.
   - Example: ""Hyeiyaa toimena atsʼa ŋoka oka."" (I know that the dog is gnawing the bone.)
     - V (gnaw) S (dog) O (bone)

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Relative clauses can have different orders but the main clause typically follows VSO.
   - Example: ""Ama na cea basaurek, isokuk."" (The person who kills an eland goes early.)
     - V (kill) S (person) O (eland)

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - In imperative clauses, the order is still VSO.
   - Example: ""Ƙaidee ɗi nak."" (Go bring the earlier one.)
     - V (go) S (you) O (one)

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Intransitive clauses follow VS order.
   - Example: ""Epa ŋok."" (The dog is asleep.)
     - V (sleep) S (dog)

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - The accusative case marks the object in transitive clauses with a third-person subject.
   - Example: ""Atsʼa kweta ncik."" (My arm is hurting me.)
     - V (eat) S (arm) O (me)

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Sequential clauses maintain VSO order.
    - Example: ""Ceesa ntsa riyek."" (He wants what?)
      - V (want) S (he) O (what)

From these examples, it is clear that the dominant word order in Ik for declarative sentences is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object).

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that the Perfective Present has SVO word order and the Present Continuous has SAuxOV word order. This indicates that SVO is a common structure in at least one tense.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the syntactic structure of the Lendu subgroup, which includes Ngiti. It states that both SVO and S(Aux)OV word orders are attested in Ngiti, with the distribution dependent on the verb tense or aspect used. This suggests that SVO is a significant word order, but it also indicates the presence of S(Aux)OV.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in the Present Continuous tense, where the object precedes the nominalized verb stem, and an auxiliary follows the subject (SAuxOV). This further supports the presence of S(Aux)OV in certain contexts.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the nominalization process and mentions that the unmarked order for numerals and nouns is numeral-noun, but it does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb.

5. **Paragraph 45**: This paragraph mentions that subject and object pronouns may be immediately attached to the verb stem, indicating some flexibility in word order but does not provide a clear dominant order.

6. **Paragraph 47**: This paragraph provides examples of verb forms and mentions different verb classes but does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb.

From the information provided, it is clear that Ngiti exhibits both SVO and S(Aux)OV word orders, with the choice dependent on the verb tense or aspect. However, the mention of SVO in the Perfective Present and the general observation that SVO is common in the Lendu subgroup suggests that SVO is likely the dominant word order in Ngiti.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the word order in Sidaama is predominantly SOV when the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words. This is supported by example sentences (5.56) and (5.57), which demonstrate the SOV order and an alternative OSV order used for focus.

2. **Paragraph 5** reinforces this by stating that the basic word order in Sidaama is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that section 5.2 of the grammar discusses word order, and the title of section 5.2.1 is ""SOV Word Order,"" further supporting the claim that SOV is the dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 24** discusses the intonation patterns in declarative sentences, which align with the SOV structure, as the verb typically appears at the end of the sentence.

5. **Paragraph 25** mentions that pauses often indicate constituent boundaries in SOV word order, further confirming the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 38** discusses the order of other types of constituents and mentions that the verb typically appears at the end of the clause, consistent with SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 50** provides additional examples of sentences with SOV order, reinforcing the consistency of this structure in the language.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, the dominant word order in Mursi can be determined by analyzing the examples of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and the object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Examples (10.22a) and (10.22b) show the structure of sentences with ditransitive verbs, indicating the order of constituents.
   - Example (10.23a) and (10.23b) illustrate the free ordering of recipient and theme in ditransitive constructions.
   - Example (10.25a) shows a canonical constituent order AVO (Agent-Verb-Object).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph explicitly states that Mursi utilizes a canonical constituent order AVO/SV (Subject-Verb-Object/Subject-Verb) and a non-canonical OVA/VS order.
   - The canonical order AVO/SV is described as the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses uttered in isolation.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (10.34a) and (10.34b) show sentences with nominative marked nouns in subject function, indicating an SVO order.
   - Example (10.34c) and (10.34d) further illustrate the canonical AVO order in transitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (10.3a) to (10.3d) provide instances of mono-transitive clauses with AVO order.
   - Example (10.4a) and (10.4b) show intransitive clauses with SV order.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (10.5a) to (10.5c) illustrate mono-transitive clauses with AVO order, where the object is a pronoun.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (10.6a) and (10.6b) show sentences with third person pronouns in object function, maintaining the AVO order.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (10.7) shows a negative declarative clause with AOV order, indicating a non-canonical order used in specific contexts.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (10.2a) to (10.2e) illustrate intransitive clauses with SV order.
   - Example (10.2f) shows a transitive clause with AVO order.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (9.51) and (9.52) show derived applicative clauses with canonical AVO order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - The linguistic profile of Mursi confirms the canonical constituent order AVO (for transitive clauses) and SV (for intransitive clauses).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Mursi is **AVO/SV**. This indicates that Mursi predominantly follows the Subject-Verb-Object order in transitive clauses and Subject-Verb order in intransitive clauses.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, the dominant word order in Majang can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic constituent order in Majang is Verb – Subject – Object (VSO). It provides examples and mentions that this order is frequently observed in elicited sentences.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reinforces the VSO order by mentioning that deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders did not produce variants, and that VSO order has a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph provides another example of VSO order in a subordinate clause, further supporting the prevalence of this word order in Majang.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions that the basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VSO, where A stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent, usually the object.

5. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph confirms the order of constituents as verb – (S/A) – object (P) – complement, which aligns with the VSO order.

6. **Paragraph 33**: This paragraph states that though the constituent order VSO is normal, the verb is often found at the end of the sentence. However, this does not contradict the dominant VSO order but rather indicates some flexibility in specific contexts.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Birri,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Birri, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - Example: ""umd-db awu ids akpasha"" (this man knows things much, i.e., is very learned).
   - Structure: Subject (umd-db) + Verb (awu) + Object (ids).
   - This suggests an SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example: ""I shall come mayi g-and"" (I shall come).
   - Structure: Subject (mayi) + Verb (g-and).
   - This is an intransitive sentence but supports the SVO structure when considering the subject precedes the verb.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example: ""He said: He is Zande ayi-kd: ni kd gbaya"" (He said: He is Zande).
   - Structure: Subject (ni) + Verb (kd) + Object (gbaya).
   - This supports the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example: ""To beat (a) man ulu amd"" (To beat a man).
   - Structure: Object (ulu) + Verb (amd).
   - This is an infinitive construction and not directly indicative of the main clause word order.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""object + verb stem: viz. the “reversed” construction, if compared to the Sudanic languages of this area (Bongo-Kresh and Ndogo-Feroge groups).""
   - This suggests that while there might be some reversed constructions, it is not the dominant order.

6. **Paragraph 22**:
   - Example: ""verb stem + object or any specification.""
   - This indicates that in imperative constructions, the verb precedes the object, but this does not necessarily reflect the dominant order in declarative sentences.

7. **Paragraph 30**:
   - Example: ""The hut burnt dhara dyo-dd"" (The hut burnt).
   - Structure: Subject (dhara) + Verb (dyo-dd).
   - This is an intransitive sentence but supports the SVO structure when considering the subject precedes the verb.

8. **Paragraph 31**:
   - Example: ""He said: He will (or would) not come ayi-ka: na-ye ga g-and cd"" (He said: He will not come).
   - Structure: Subject (na-ye) + Verb (ga g-and).
   - This supports the SVO order.

From these observations, it is evident that the dominant word order in Birri is **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**. The examples consistently show the subject preceding the verb and the verb preceding the object in declarative sentences.

### Conclusion: SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo

Coptic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Coptic, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""S-V-O order can be established as the basic word order on syntactic grounds,"" and provides examples such as ""a brother (oy-con) asked (a ... xne) Apa Sarapion (...)"". It also mentions that Coptic is a head-initial language where the verb precedes the direct and indirect objects.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in Sahidic Coptic but emphasizes that the canonical order is S-V-O. It mentions that deviations from this order are pragmatically motivated, indicating that S-V-O is the default or unmarked order.

3. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that S-V-O is the basic word order, providing further examples and stating that this order reflects the basic structural relations between the verb and its arguments.

4. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses subject inversion and other marked constructions but confirms that the canonical order is S-V-O, with other orders being used for specific pragmatic purposes.

5. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph reiterates that S-V-O is the basic word order and discusses the conditions under which other orders might appear, such as for focus or topicalization.

6. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph again confirms S-V-O as the basic word order from which other patterns are derived.

7. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses residual V-S-O order but indicates that this is a less common, syntactically unproductive pattern, reinforcing that S-V-O is the dominant order.

8. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph provides examples of different subject positions but confirms that S-V-O is the basic word order.

9. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph provides examples of S-V-O order in pragmatically neutral contexts, further supporting it as the dominant order.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in Coptic is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), as consistently indicated across multiple paragraphs in the descriptive grammar.",svo,svo
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

From the provided paragraphs, several key points emerge that help determine the dominant word order in Igbo:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the structure of the verb phrase (VP) in Igbo, indicating that the verb is the head of the VP and governs the entire VP. This suggests that the verb plays a central role in sentence structure.

2. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions that transitive verbs in Igbo take an NP object and an NP subject, indicating that the subject and object are both present in sentences involving transitive verbs.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Provides examples of verbs and their objects, showing that verbs often appear before their objects, e.g., ""Eat the yam!"" This suggests a V-O structure.

4. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the ergative tendencies in Igbo but does not provide direct evidence of word order. However, it does mention that all Igbo verbs are transitive, implying that sentences typically involve both a subject and an object.

5. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions that voice is not a significant category in Igbo, but does not directly address word order.

6. **Paragraph 20**: States that case is marked by word order and tonal morphemes, suggesting that word order is important in conveying grammatical relationships.

7. **Paragraph 36**: Provides a schematic representation of sentence structure, showing that the verb (V) appears after the subject (NP) and before the object (NP), indicating an SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 38**: Discusses the arguments for transitivity in Igbo, mentioning that verbs can be transitive or intransitive depending on context. This implies that the verb's position relative to the subject and object is flexible but typically follows an SVO pattern.

9. **Paragraph 44**: Provides examples of complex verbs and their complements, showing that verbs often appear before their objects.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Igbo appears to be **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**. This conclusion is supported by the schematic representation of sentence structure and the examples provided, which consistently show the verb appearing between the subject and the object.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the paragraphs, the dominant word order in Gorowa is **SOV**. This is explicitly stated in multiple paragraphs and supported by examples.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Shatt,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Shatt language, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""Nya abisoloni nuxung sadogäng täging"" (If only sweet sorghum was given to you).
   - Structure: Subject (Nya abisoloni) - Object (nuxung) - Verb (sadogäng).

2. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example: ""Na kala apoco kox Nyaxolow poko päxä deny"" (Then Hare saw Hyena carrying the calf).
   - Structure: Subject (Na kala apoco) - Object (päxä deny) - Verb (poko).

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""Kig kasiy ya"" (Person ate meat).
   - Structure: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasiy) - Object (ya).

4. **Paragraph 22**:
   - Example: ""Kig kasax op"" (Person refused young man).
   - Structure: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasax) - Object (op).

5. **Paragraph 33**:
   - Example: ""Kig kasax op"" (Person refused the young man).
   - Structure: Subject (Kig) - Verb (kasax) - Object (op).

From these examples, it is clear that the typical sentence structure in Shatt follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. The subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

### Reasoning:
The analysis of the provided sentences consistently shows the pattern where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object. This pattern is observed across multiple examples, indicating that SVO is the dominant word order in Shatt.

### Conclusion:
SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can derive the dominant word order by examining the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here is the analysis of relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: ""The direct object NP is positioned after the verb, and has no morphological inflection.""
   - This suggests an SVO or VSO order since the object follows the verb.

2. **Paragraph 2**: ""In a simple non-emphasized sentence the subject NP precedes the verb (sole exception: 2nd person plural imperatives) and the object NPs (direct and indirect) follow the verb.""
   - This clearly indicates an SVO order: Subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.

3. **Paragraph 6**: ""This is the only possible order of verb arguments, since a true benefactive always follows both the direct and indirect object.""
   - This supports the SVO structure where the verb precedes both objects.

4. **Paragraph 7**: ""The subject NP is positioned before the verb.""
   - This reinforces the SVO structure with the subject preceding the verb.

5. **Paragraph 8**: ""Here, the order of the constituents 'woman' and 'millet' is free: both (195) and (196) are equally good sentences.""
   - This suggests some flexibility in the order of objects but does not contradict the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 9**: ""Koromfe sentences require a subject, but are quite free in allowing (or allowing the omission of) all other verb arguments.""
   - This indicates that while the presence of the subject is mandatory, the language allows flexibility in the placement of other arguments, but it does not negate the SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 13**: ""The indirect object NP is positioned after the verb.""
   - This supports the SVO structure where the verb precedes the indirect object.

8. **Paragraph 14**: ""In sentences with a direct and indirect object, both types of object can be expressed by a suffixal clitic pronoun.""
   - This does not directly affect the SVO order but indicates the positioning of clitics.

9. **Paragraph 15**: ""In natural speech, a conditional clause usually precedes the main clause, but my informants were equally happy with the reversed order.""
   - This suggests flexibility in clause order but does not contradict the SVO order.

10. **Paragraph 16**: ""The order of constituents is NP-COPULA-ADVERBIAL.""
    - This is specific to copular sentences and does not directly affect the SVO order in transitive clauses.

11. **Paragraph 17**: ""The relative pronoun may not be within a pre-/postpositional phrase in the relative clause.""
    - This is about relative clauses and does not affect the basic SVO order.

12. **Paragraph 18**: ""The element which normally appears in the position next to a subordinating conjunction is the subject of the subordinate clause.""
    - This suggests the subject precedes the verb, supporting the SVO order.

13. **Paragraph 19**: ""The modifying adverbial always follows the modified adverbial.""
    - This is about adverbial modification and does not affect the SVO order.

14. **Paragraph 20**: ""The temporal clause construction is often replaced by the conditional adverb clause.""
    - This is about clause order and does not affect the SVO order.

15. **Paragraph 21**: ""The RELATIVE PRONOUN k5N, which I have termed NON-SPECIFIC because it does not inflect for number and humanness, is homophonous (and probably syntactically identical) with the temporal conjunction k5N.""
    - This is about relative pronouns and does not affect the SVO order.

16. **Paragraph 22**: ""In subordinate clauses, it is possible, and usual, to question in situ those words and phrases which in single-clause questions must occur sentence-initially.""
    - This is about question formation and does not affect the SVO order.

17. **Paragraph 23**: ""It is also possible to coordinate nominal adjectives and participles with a repeated article a.""
    - This is about coordination and does not affect the SVO order.

18. **Paragraph 24**: ""Interrogative main clauses in Koromfe normally have the wh-word or phrase in initial position.""
    - This is about question formation and does not affect the SVO order.

19. **Paragraph 25**: ""The numerals from 1 to 9 have class prefixes (singular nand ga, plural I).""
    - This is about numeral formation and does not affect the SVO order.

20. **Paragraph 26**: ""The phonological shape of the stems of the verbs with the UNMARKED form bE, je and pa is uncertain.""
    - This is about verb morphology and does not affect the SVO order.

21. **Paragraph 27**: ""Apart from its alternative (and more usual) shortened UNMARKED form, this verb is regular.""
    - This is about verb morphology and does not affect the SVO order.

22. **Paragraph 28**: ""Koromfe has no passive morphology as such; the verb forms which are found in the few passive usages that exist in the language are morphologically identical to their active counterparts.""
    - This is about passive constructions and does not affect the SVO order.

23. **Paragraph 29**: ""Verbs cannot be coordinated; the smallest constituent containing a verb which can be coordinated is a clause.""
    - This is about coordination and does not affect the SVO order.

Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nyimang can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 10** provides clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns:
   - ""gil ... doso ka tam"" (the dog is eating food)
   - ""kwedile ka f'idsij"" (the salt is finished)

   - ""sn a miro ka tushe"" (she has lit the fire)
   - ""wadaI,J timi:l:.o. tows"" (the man is making a wattle door)

   These examples show the structure where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb, indicating an SVO order.

**Conclusion:** SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Lamé,"### Reasoning for Dominant Word Order in Lamé

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, we can deduce the dominant word order by examining the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs in various sentence structures. Here are the key observations:

1. **Subject Position**:
   - The subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and verb (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples: 
     - ""dʒwə fáŋ ʔya ɮé"" (the chief left again) - Subject (dʒwə) precedes Verb (ɮé).
     - ""ndʒɪn màn ɮɛ́ si"" (My story starts right now) - Subject (ndʒɪn màn) precedes Verb (ɮɛ́).

2. **Object Position**:
   - In a clause with only one non-subject argument, the grammatical role of the nominal direct object is indicated by the position immediately after the verb (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""namba záʔ ʒyè ɓáyrúm"" (We found a lot of peanuts) - Verb (záʔ) precedes Object (ʒyè).
     - ""na də̀ tʃe sum myenʔ/gur ye"" (I will drink beer slowly/at long last) - Verb (tʃe) precedes Object (sum).

3. **Pronouns as Direct Objects**:
   - In perfective and subjunctive clauses, the object pronoun from the perfective set immediately follows the verb (SVO) (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""mum ʔí nàn-à"" (he insulted me) - Verb (ʔí) precedes Object pronoun (nàn).
     - ""na wé nùm wə Garoua"" (I saw him in Garoua) - Verb (wé) precedes Object pronoun (nùm).

4. **Non-perfective Clauses**:
   - In non-perfective clauses, the object pronoun precedes the verb (SOV) (Paragraph 2).
   - Examples:
     - ""lum wə́ sə́ ti"" (the lion is eating it) - Subject (lum) precedes Object pronoun (sə́) and Verb (ti).
     - ""ta də̀ nùm pum-u"" (she will hit him) - Subject (ta) precedes Object pronoun (nùm) and Verb (pum).

5. **Summary of Coding of Grammatical Roles**:
   - The table in Paragraph 16 summarizes the coding means for grammatical relations, indicating that the dominant order for perfective/subjunctive clauses is SVO and for non-perfective clauses is SOV.

### Conclusion: SVO

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Lamé is **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object). This conclusion is supported by the consistent placement of the subject before the verb and the object immediately following the verb in perfective and subjunctive clauses, which are the primary structures analyzed in the grammar.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Bininj Gun-Wok,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bininj Gun-Wok, the language exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order. The evidence suggests that all orders of subject, object, and verb are grammatically possible. However, the text also indicates that certain orders are more common than others in specific contexts.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that all orderings are grammatically possible and that there is no evidence that particular orders (like SVO) are used to disambiguate sentences. It also notes that the commonest orders in transitive clauses with one external nominal group are OV, SV, and VO.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of all six possible word orders (SOV, SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS, OSV) and notes that verb-initial orders are the rarest.
3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the flexibility of word order in Bininj Gun-Wok and mentions that word order plays an important role in discourse organization but is limited in its grammatical function.

Given this information, it is clear that Bininj Gun-Wok does not have a single dominant word order. Instead, it allows for multiple word orders, with some being more common in specific contexts but no single order being predominant across all contexts.

**Conclusion:**
No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wambaya,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 3 (Chapter 7, Syntax of Simple Sentences)**:
   - It mentions that Wambaya has two basic clause types: verbal and nominal (or verbless).
   - Verbal clauses have a finite verb as predicate and usually require the presence of an auxiliary.
   - It is stated that word order in verbless clauses is relatively free, with the subject able to precede or follow the predicate, or be discontinuous.

2. **Paragraph 4 (Chapter 1, The Language and Its Speakers)**:
   - It is noted that Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and the word order is relatively free, which is common for Australian languages.

3. **Paragraph 14 (Chapter 3, Parts of Speech and Other Preliminaries)**:
   - The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar and is obligatory in every main verbal clause.
   - The auxiliary contains bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause and usually occurs in the second position in the clause.

4. **Paragraph 19 (Chapter 5, The Auxiliary)**:
   - The auxiliary in Wambaya contains bound pronouns that represent the subject and object of the clause, as well as affixes that provide tense, aspect, mood, and directional information.
   - The auxiliary occurs in the second position and is usually obligatory in every main verbal clause.

5. **Paragraph 21 (Chapter 5, The Auxiliary)**:
   - Every auxiliary must contain a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of the clause.
   - The presence of bound pronouns in the auxiliary means that it is possible, and indeed usual, to omit the overt NP if all the necessary information is included in the bound pronoun itself, or if it is evident from context or previous discourse.

6. **Paragraph 27 (Chapter 8, Syntax of Complex Sentences)**:
   - Non-finite subordinate clauses are reduced clauses that do not contain an auxiliary and provide no information concerning tense, aspect, and mood.
   - There are three types of non-finite subordinate clauses in Wambaya: prior, simultaneous, and purposive.

### Conclusion

From the above analysis, it is clear that Wambaya exhibits a relatively free word order, with significant reliance on the auxiliary to convey grammatical information. The auxiliary's position in the clause and the flexibility in the placement of subjects and objects suggest that there is no single dominant word order in Wambaya. Instead, the language allows for various configurations depending on discourse conditions and the presence of the auxiliary.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wardaman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, the dominant word order in the language can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of object, agent, and subject in Wardaman. It mentions that there is a tendency for lexically specified nouns or noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verbal word rather than after it. However, it also provides examples of different orders such as VOA, OVA, and AVO, indicating variability in the word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the concept of ""free word order"" in Australian languages, including Wardaman. It mentions that while Wardaman exhibits greater freedom of ordering than English, not all orders are equally common. This suggests that there is some flexibility in word order, but it does not provide a clear dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the importance of prosodically defined units and their interaction with grammatical structure. It mentions that tone units do not necessarily correspond to grammatical units, and that nominal words are frequently set off in their own tone units.

**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can analyze the word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""constituent order is 'free' (Dixon 1980:441),"" indicating that changing the order does not affect the referential or experiential meaning of a clause. However, it also states that ""Gooniyandi is a theme-first language,"" suggesting that the thematic element often comes first in a sentence.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the structure of reflexive/reciprocal, transitive, and middle clauses but does not provide specific examples of word order.

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that ""exemplifying clauses differ from intensive clauses in that (i) they have indefinite Identifieds, whereas intensive identifying clauses always have definite Identifieds, and (ii) the order of the roles is fixed."" This suggests some flexibility in word order but does not specify a dominant order.

4. **Paragraph 8** discusses the textual organization of the clause, indicating that ""information structure in Gooniyandi is expressed primarily prosodically, by intonation features, and the thematic structure is realized through constituent order."" This implies that word order can vary based on thematic and informational structure.

5. **Paragraph 14** states that ""constituent order in intensive identifying clauses is free, and the Identifier may precede or follow the Identified, whereas in characterizing clauses constituent order is relatively rigid."" This again suggests flexibility in word order.

6. **Paragraph 15** mentions that the ergative postposition is optional and that its presence or absence does not necessarily indicate a fixed word order.

7. **Paragraph 17** discusses the division of texts into tone units and information units, indicating that the order of constituents can vary based on the information structure.

8. **Paragraph 19** mentions that ""the lack of contrast between phrase and clause at the level of form has led some linguists to suggest that verbless clauses in other Australian languages resembling Gooniyandi consist of just single NPs.""

9. **Paragraph 27** discusses the thematic structure of clauses, indicating that ""the Theme is most frequently chosen from the register of what is given"" and that ""Themes not infrequently convey new information.""

10. **Paragraph 28** mentions that ""the information Focus usually falls on the final IC in an information unit,"" suggesting that the order can vary based on focus and thematic structure.

11. **Paragraph 29** discusses avoidance speech and indicates that ""avoidance speech is characteristically vaguer in expression than is ordinary speech,"" implying that word order may be influenced by social and pragmatic factors.

12. **Paragraph 30** mentions that ""Gooniyandi avoidance style is characterized by a cluster of formal features and strategies of language use which distinguish it from other Gooniyandi styles of speech,"" suggesting variability in word order based on speech style.

13. **Paragraph 31** discusses the multifunctionality of lexical items and indicates that ""a single word-form can usually occur in a variety of syntagmatic contexts,"" implying flexibility in word order.

14. **Paragraph 32** mentions that ""the major parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi are set out in Table 3-1 below,"" but does not provide specific information on word order.

15. **Paragraph 33** discusses the structure of the verb phrase and indicates that ""the VP consists of two obligatory grammatical words, which are mutually bound to, and modify, one another, and which occur in a fixed order,"" suggesting some rigidity in the internal structure of the verb phrase but not necessarily in the overall clause structure.

16. **Paragraph 34** mentions that ""the structure of the whole is clearly not that of an NP - it cannot be described in terms of the functions identified for the NP,"" indicating that word order may vary based on the syntactic structure of the clause.

17. **Paragraph 35** discusses the functions of postpositions and indicates that ""the postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases,"" suggesting that word order may be influenced by the presence of postpositions.

18. **Paragraph 36** mentions that ""the postpositions in the first column, on the other hand, do not indicate any property or quality of the referent of the nominal phrase to which they are attached,"" implying that word order may be influenced by the syntactic role of the postpositions.

19. **Paragraph 37** discusses the functions of the ergative postposition and indicates that ""the ergative postposition is optional except when the Agent is inanimate,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the ergative postposition.

20. **Paragraph 38** mentions that ""the dative postposition -yoo- -woo marks units in both clause rank roles,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

21. **Paragraph 39** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

22. **Paragraph 40** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

23. **Paragraph 41** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

24. **Paragraph 42** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

25. **Paragraph 43** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

26. **Paragraph 44** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

27. **Paragraph 45** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

28. **Paragraph 46** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

29. **Paragraph 47** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

30. **Paragraph 48** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

31. **Paragraph 49** discusses the functions of the dative postposition and indicates that ""the dative postposition is occasionally absent where its presence is expected,"" suggesting flexibility in word order based on the presence or absence of the dative postposition.

32. **Paragraph 50** mentions that ""the dative postposition may mark a qualifying expression,"" indicating that word order may be influenced by the presence of the dative postposition.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**

The analysis of the provided paragraphs suggests that Gooniyandi exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, influenced by thematic structure, information focus, and the presence of postpositions. Therefore, it is most appropriate to conclude that Gooniyandi has no dominant word order.",no dominant order,no dominant order
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can infer the dominant word order in Tiwi by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4**: It mentions that in Modern Tiwi (MT), the word order has become more rigid, typically being SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object) when there is an uninflected verb. This suggests a tendency towards SVO order in MT.

2. **Paragraph 7**: It states that in Traditional Tiwi (TT), the unmarked order is SP0 (Subject-Predicate-Object), but this can vary due to discourse considerations. This indicates that while SVO is common, other orders are also possible depending on context.

3. **Paragraph 6**: It mentions that in MT, the unmarked order is SP (Subject-Predicate) when there is an overt subject, but this order can be reversed. This again suggests a preference for SVO order but with some flexibility.

4. **Paragraph 5**: It discusses that in TT, the arguments other than the subject in intransitive clauses can include indirect objects and concomitatives, but it does not provide a clear indication of the dominant word order for transitive clauses.

5. **Paragraph 3**: It provides examples of verb forms and their usage but does not directly address the word order in declarative sentences.

6. **Paragraph 2**: It discusses verb forms and inflections in detail but does not provide information on the dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 1**: It does not contain relevant information about word order.

From the above points, it is evident that both Traditional Tiwi and Modern Tiwi exhibit a tendency towards SVO order, especially in declarative sentences with uninflected verbs. However, there is some flexibility in word order due to discourse considerations.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Nakkara,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract several examples of sentence structures that include both subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V). Here are the relevant examples:

1. **Paragraph 5:**
   - Sentence: ""Nakkarrawura barrngebana kibibburda.""
   - Analysis: ""Nakkarrawura"" (round yam, fem) is the subject (S), ""barr"" (they) is the subject pronoun (S), ""nge"" (UAf) is the subject pronoun (S), ""ba"" (go) is the verb (V), ""kibi"" (hit) is the verb (V), ""bburda"" (dig) is the object (O).
   - Structure: S V O

2. **Paragraph 6:**
   - Sentence: ""Kabbala nginabbawaya ngalarrakakkandja rdayengka.""
   - Analysis: ""Kabbala"" (boat) is the object (O), ""ngina"" (1UA) is the subject pronoun (S), ""bbawa"" (leave) is the verb (V), ""ngalarrakakka"" (float) is the verb (V), ""rdayengka"" (go along) is the verb (V).
   - Structure: O S V

3. **Paragraph 8:**
   - Sentence: ""Nakkamana ngibakkaya warrkkendjarra morrakiya kebana.""
   - Analysis: ""Nakkamana"" (dog) is the subject (S), ""ngiba"" (1A) is the subject pronoun (S), ""kkaya"" (take) is the verb (V), ""warrkkendjarra"" (bandicoot) is the object (O), ""morrakiya"" (smell) is the verb (V), ""kebana"" (go) is the verb (V).
   - Structure: S V O

4. **Paragraph 22:**
   - Sentence: ""Mangaya_—ki+ddjiddaya-na.""
   - Analysis: ""Mangaya"" (mother) is the subject (S), ""ki"" (she) is the subject pronoun (S), ""ddjiddaya"" (laugh) is the verb (V), ""na"" (past tense marker).
   - Structure: S V

5. **Paragraph 31:**
   - Sentence: ""Ngarabba ngiyakabba njawuna njeyabba.""
   - Analysis: ""Ngarabba"" (I) is the subject (S), ""ngiyakabba"" (her) is the object (O), ""njawuna"" (give) is the verb (V), ""njeyabba"" (you) is the object (O).
   - Structure: S O V

From these examples, we can observe that the dominant word order in Nakkara appears to be **SVO**. This is evident from multiple instances where the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.

### Conclusion: SVO",not mentioned in the grammar,svo
Garrwa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, we can deduce the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points from the paragraphs that inform our conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Garrwa, like many Australian languages, has free word order but also notes that there are clear patterns of ordering. The canonical word order in simple sentences is described by a template where the core of the sentence includes the verb and TAM clitic, followed by pronouns and nominal groups representing core arguments.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph explicitly states that Garrwa has a verb-initial basic word order. It mentions that verbs occur either clause-initially or immediately after the second position clitic, leading to the analysis that Garrwa has a verb-initial basic word order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph describes the structure of transitive and intransitive constructions, providing examples where the verb appears at the beginning of the clause, followed by the subject and object.

4. **Paragraph 9**: It discusses the status of second-position pronouns and notes that the verb is the initial element of the core in declarative sentences of positive polarity, with other elements occurring in the immediate post-core position.

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph reinforces that in declarative sentences of positive polarity, the verb is the initial element of the core, with other elements following in non-canonical word orders only under marked pragmatic contexts.

6. **Paragraph 12**: It mentions that interrogative words, negative particles, and contrastive particles can occupy the initial position, pushing the verb to the post-core position, but this is a marked, non-canonical order.

7. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses pragmatically determined non-canonical orders, where nouns or temporal adverbs can precede the verb for emphasis or focus.

8. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides examples of chained clauses where the verb appears initially, followed by tense/aspect markers and pronouns, indicating a verb-initial structure.

9. **Paragraph 21**: It mentions that Garrwa is typologically distinctive for its verb-initial basic word order among other features.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Garrwa is **VSO (Verb-Subject-Object)**.

**Conclusion: VSO**",no dominant order,vso
Ngankikurungkurr,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngankikurungkurr, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the typical order of the verb stem following the auxiliary, but also notes exceptions where the verb root precedes the auxiliary. This indicates some flexibility in verb placement but does not directly address the order of subject and object.

2. **Paragraph 4** provides an example where the subject and object can appear in any order with respect to the verb. The example given shows the subject and object both appearing before the verb: ""wa-wunu wupun-@-ta"" (He hit that man), and ""wa-wunu-ninggi dam-©-pawal"" (then that man speared him).

3. **Paragraph 6** gives an example of a complex verb with the verb root ordered before the auxiliary: ""wananggal-ninggi yityi-meny-bi"" (What did the doctor tell you/do to you).

4. **Paragraph 8** shows examples of verbs with subjects and objects: ""walipan ngerinyrag-yerr"" (I soaked the rag), and ""ngemeny-me-yerr"" (I soaked my hands).

5. **Paragraph 11** provides an example of a transitive verb with an incorporated body part: ""ngaenyi-tyerr-pu-pe"" (I'm going to ask you).

6. **Paragraph 16** shows examples of verbs with locative and source case enclitics: ""yarany-fi-tit musyulng-nide-nimbi"" (You got up from inside your swag), and ""ganbinyinnindidjeridu ANAme-wawembenm-nide-nimbi"" (He picked up the didjeridu from inside the house).

7. **Paragraph 25** discusses the competition between dual subject markers and object markers for the final auxiliary slot, indicating that subject and object markers are both important in verb morphology.

8. **Paragraph 30** mentions that the combination of auxiliaries and verb stems is productive and that auxiliaries do not form rigid classes, implying flexibility in verb placement.

9. **Paragraph 31** provides an example of a verb with an incorporated body part: ""dangim-@-tyi-pawal"" (He speared her in the breast).

10. **Paragraph 34** discusses the syntactic incorporation of body parts into verbs and provides examples: ""ngarim-fi-yedirr-tyat"" (I stood up the tyre), and ""dangim-fi-firr-tyat"" (He placed it at the foot of the tree).

11. **Paragraph 38** mentions the irregular ordering of the 'say' auxiliary after the verb root and provides examples: ""ngambanam-palat"" (As we went past the turnoff, Tyarambu whistled at us), and ""kukuk nuwurr ngirrkik-ngumum"" (Hang on a minute! I'm out of breath).

From these examples, it is clear that Ngankikurungkurr exhibits flexibility in word order, with instances of both SVO and SOV structures, as well as variations in verb placement relative to subjects and objects. This suggests that there is no single dominant word order in the language.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Wagiman,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, several key points emerge regarding the word order of the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph highlights the significant freedom of constituent order in Wagiman. It mentions that there are 59 different sentence order types and that only 6 sentences actually contained both an agent (A) and an object (O). This suggests a high degree of flexibility in word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides some statistical data on the occurrence of different orders. It mentions that the object (O) tends to occur initially or before the verb (V) and/or agent (A) in a ratio of 3 to 1. However, it also states that there is no clearly favored order in clauses containing two core NPs (subject and object).

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph explicitly states that Wagiman lacks a basic word order. It mentions that it is extremely rare for Wagiman sentences to contain free nominal expressions of both A and O, providing little evidence for statements about 'basic' order.

4. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph reiterates that Wagiman does not have a normal SOV order and discusses the freedom of constituent order.

5. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides a summary of constituent orders in sentences with two NPs, showing a variety of orders without a clear dominant pattern.

6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph concludes that major constituent order in Wagiman is generally free, although some order tendencies within constituents can be determined.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, it is clear that Wagiman exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its word order and does not have a dominant word order for the arrangement of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences with two nominal participants. The grammar explicitly states that there is no basic word order and that the language must be described as having 'free' word order.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), the dominant word order can be determined by examining the placement of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences. Here is the analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""The subject constituent is regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6), or is placed after the predicate (7–10).""
   - Analysis: This indicates that the subject often precedes the verb and object, suggesting an SVO structure.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example: ""When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.""
   - Analysis: This suggests flexibility but does not contradict the SVO structure as a dominant order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example: ""The subject is placed either before or after the verb.""
   - Analysis: This indicates some flexibility in word order, but the dominant structure is not explicitly contradicted.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example: ""The subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of the clause by an intonation group boundary.""
   - Analysis: This again suggests flexibility but does not indicate a dominant order different from SVO.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example: ""The subject is regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate.""
   - Analysis: This supports the SVO structure.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example: ""The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not postposed after the predicate.""
   - Analysis: This supports the SVO structure.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example: ""The subject is placed either before or after the verb.""
   - Analysis: This indicates flexibility but does not contradict the SVO structure as a dominant order.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example: ""The subject is regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate.""
   - Analysis: This supports the SVO structure.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example: ""The subject is placed either before or after the verb.""
   - Analysis: This indicates flexibility but does not contradict the SVO structure as a dominant order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Example: ""The subject is regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate.""

Conclusion: **SVO**",sov,svo
English,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar, we can analyze the dominant word order in English by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs that help determine the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""You heard their arguments."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""You"" precedes the verb ""heard,"" and the object ""their arguments"" follows the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example: ""The moral objections are more important."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""The moral objections"" precedes the verb ""are,"" and the complement ""more important"" follows the verb.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example: ""Where were the children’s toys?"" (SVO in declarative form)
   - Explanation: In the declarative form, ""The children’s toys were under the bed,"" the subject ""The children’s toys"" precedes the verb ""were,"" and the complement ""under the bed"" follows the verb.

4. **Paragraph 24**:
   - Example: ""She took the others."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""She"" precedes the verb ""took,"" and the object ""the others"" follows the verb.

5. **Paragraph 29**:
   - Example: ""I sent Sue a copy."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""I"" precedes the verb ""sent,"" and the object ""Sue"" follows the verb.

6. **Paragraph 36**:
   - Example: ""She finished the work."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""She"" precedes the verb ""finished,"" and the object ""the work"" follows the verb.

7. **Paragraph 38**:
   - Example: ""He gave Sue immediately all the spare keys he had had cut."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""He"" precedes the verb ""gave,"" and the object ""Sue"" follows the verb.

8. **Paragraph 47**:
   - Example: ""She was very bright and had a warm personality."" (SVO)
   - Explanation: The subject ""She"" precedes the verb ""was,"" and the complement ""very bright"" follows the verb.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in English is **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**. This is consistently demonstrated across multiple examples where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows the verb in declarative sentences. 

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Korean,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Korean, several key points indicate the dominant word order in Korean:

- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end. For instance, ""Ayki emeni ponta"" is given, which translates to ""The baby looks at the mother."" Here, ""Ayki"" (the baby) is the subject, ""emeni"" (the mother) is the object, and ""ponta"" (looks) is the verb, indicating an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.

- **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses sentence expansion and provides examples such as ""(Cikum) (emeni ka) ayki lul poNTA"" which translates to ""Now the mother looks at the baby."" Again, this follows the SOV order.

- **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that not every verb can occur in all constructions, but it does not contradict the SOV order. It also provides examples like ""Nam pukkule",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, the dominant word order in Basque can be determined through several key points:

1. **Neutral Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that most Basque grammarians identify SOV as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order. This is supported by examples such as ""AitaSainduak atzo bi erresumeri aphezpiku bat ararteko igorri diote"" (The Holy Father sent yesterday a bishop to the two nations as mediator), which follows the SOV structure.
   - Paragraph 2 reinforces this by stating that the adjective 'neutral' applied to the SOV order implies no constituent is emphasized over the others, and any other order usually involves focalization.

2. **Focalization and Constraints**:
   - Paragraph 2 also discusses that any other preverbal argument in any other order (and perhaps the verb itself in the verb-initial orders VSO and VOS) is usually construed as focalized, indicating that SOV is the default, non-focalized order.
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that when there is a constraint on the relative order of arguments, it is always the subject-object order that is required, further supporting the SOV structure.

3. **Heavy Constituents**:
   - Paragraph 4 notes that while the neutral position of nominal objects is preverbal, clausal objects can be postverbal, which might result in SVO order in specific contexts. However, this does not negate the general SOV tendency.

4. **Word Order in Relative Clauses**:
   - Paragraph 7 states that there is a strong word order constraint in relative clauses where the finite verb form must end the clause, aligning with the SOV structure.

5. **Examples and Analysis**:
   - Throughout the paragraphs, various examples consistently show the SOV order as the neutral or basic structure, with deviations often marked by specific pragmatic or syntactic contexts (e.g., focalization, heaviness of constituents).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the most relevant information regarding the word order in Malayalam is found in Paragraph 3:

> ""Though the verb usually occupies the final position in the sentence as in the examples of 1.1.1 it may be noted that word order is not rigid as seen below.""

This statement indicates that the verb typically appears at the end of the sentence, which suggests a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. However, it also mentions that the word order is not rigid, implying some flexibility in the structure. Despite this flexibility, the usual placement of the verb at the end of the sentence is a strong indicator of the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Iu Mien,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mien, the dominant word order in the language can be determined by examining the evidence presented:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language and mentions that while SVO is not strictly grammaticalized, it plays an important role.
   
2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph indicates that Iu Mien, along with other Hmong-Mien languages, shows an SVO order in pragmatically neutral clauses, although object-fronting for discourse-pragmatic purposes is common.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph argues against Iu Mien being primarily an SVO language, emphasizing the role of pragmatics in word-order choice.

4. **Paragraph 4**: It argues for the basicness of Topic-Focus word order and mentions that SVO in its bare form is rare, suggesting that pragmatic principles rather than syntactic ones explain the word order.

5. **Paragraph 5**: It discusses the principle of verb-medial word order and mentions that the appearance of SVO is not necessarily grammaticalized.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph explicitly states that an isolated SVO order is rare and argues against considering Iu Mien as an SVO language.

7. **Paragraph 8**: It mentions that Iu Mien is perceived as a topic-prominent language rather than an SVO language, even though SVO order does occur.

8. **Paragraph 10**: It compares Iu Mien with Thai and discusses the pragmatic principles that determine word order, suggesting that Iu Mien should be described in its own terms rather than being labeled as an SVO language.

9. **Paragraph 14**: It summarizes the principles governing Iu Mien's structure, emphasizing that it is a pragmatically configured verb-medial language and not strictly SVO.

10. **Paragraph 17**: It reiterates that Iu Mien is a verb-medial language with pragmatically assigned positions for Topic and Focus, and that the appearance of SVO is not necessarily grammaticalized.

11. **Paragraph 30**: It states that while SVO order does occur, the topic-focus order is dominant in actual speech events and discourse.

12. **Paragraph 32**: It mentions that in actual speech, the basic constituent order is still SVO, but this is in the context of modifications like adverbs or aspectual verbs.

13. **Paragraph 49**: It provides a structure for basic constituent order at the sentence level, emphasizing the roles of Topic and Focus.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while SVO order does occur in Iu Mien, it is not the dominant or strictly grammaticalized order. Instead, the language relies heavily on pragmatic principles, particularly the Topic-Focus structure, to determine word order. Therefore, the dominant word order cannot be strictly classified as SVO.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Semelai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Semelai, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1:** Mentions that the most frequently employed constituent order is verb-initial, with either A (subject) and O (object), or S (subject) placed after the verb.
  
- **Paragraph 2:** States that there is no single basic order in Semelai, but there is a tendency for verb-initial structures in transitive clauses. It also mentions that constituent order is fluid and pragmatically determined.

- **Paragraph 6:** Discusses the frequent partial representation and zero-representation of arguments, complicating the characterization of a basic constituent order.

- **Paragraph 7:** Indicates that the S in the complement clause is post-verbal, reflecting the permissible main clause word order V S.

- **Paragraph 17:** Describes the universal clause structure as A V O in transitive clauses.

- **Paragraph 28:** States that in transitive clauses, the ordering is usually verb-initial, although any argument may be pre-verbal.

- **Paragraph 31:** Mentions that the ordering of constituents in the transitive complement clause is V (O) (PP), identical to the constituent order of the universal clause.

- **Paragraph 36:** Discusses the syntactic typology of Semelai, highlighting that core grammatical relations are marked by a system of clitic cross-referencing in the transitive clause, with the A (subject) cross-referenced by a pronominal proclitic on the verb.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while Semelai exhibits fluid and pragmatically determined word order, there is a strong tendency for verb-initial structures in transitive clauses. This suggests that the dominant word order in Semelai is likely to be VSO (Verb-Subject-Object).

2. **Conclusion:** VSO",no dominant order,vso
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the most frequent word order in terms of core constituents is subject-object-verb (SOV). It also notes that the word order is flexible, especially in finite clauses, but the SOV order is illustrated by most examples in the grammar.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that the most frequent word order is verb-final, which aligns with the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 5** discusses deviations from the SOV order, indicating that while SOV is the norm, other orders can occur under specific discourse conditions.

4. **Paragraph 7** states that the word order patterns in Kolyma Yukaghir are overwhelmingly head-final, which includes SOV in main clauses, although other orders are possible.

5. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 23** provide examples where the subject precedes the object and the verb, further supporting the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 36** discuss the structure of noun phrases and relative clauses, which are head-final, consistent with an SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 49** summarizes that subject properties in Yukaghir are associated with the primary participant, independently of Focus marking, supporting the notion that the subject typically precedes the object and verb.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Georgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Georgian, we can analyze the word order in Georgian declarative sentences. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

Alutor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alutor, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and statements related to the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It states that ""Alutor has free word order. It is often difficult to claim which order is basic.""
   - However, it also mentions that ""the most frequent word order structures are SVO and VSO.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Examples given include:
     - (29) a. tita·qaqutkinJnJaqu-nakmaN.ki·@anaone.dayQutkinnaqu-ERG+SGsomewhere123ga-la@u-linynny-@yn.
     - This example is not fully clear in terms of word order, but the mention of SVO and VSO as frequent structures is reiterated.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Discusses the variability of word order in clauses with nominal predicates, showing examples of both SV and VS orders.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Examples of nominal clauses with adjectival predicates show both SV and VS orders:
     - (30) a. myri becausemur-iga-qe.takalN-any-katgu-muri.we-NOM+DUCOMIT-brother-COMITADJ-strong-1du(This is) because my brother and I are strong.

6. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Discusses the flexibility of the order of main and subordinate clauses, indicating that the order is not fixed.

### Conclusion:

The descriptive grammar of Alutor indicates that the language exhibits a high degree of word order flexibility, with both SVO and VSO orders being frequently observed. However, it explicitly states that it is difficult to claim a basic or dominant word order due to this flexibility. Given the information, it is reasonable to conclude that Alutor does not have a single dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Thai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Thai, we can determine the dominant word order of the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example: ""POM JA PY YEE-AM NAI LEK"" (I will go and visit Nai Lek).
   - Analysis: The structure of this sentence is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), where ""POM"" is the subject, ""JA PY"" is the verb phrase, and ""YEE-AM NAI LEK"" is the object.

2. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""Pom yahk ja sung bee-a koo-at yy suk sorng lo"" (I want to order two dozen large beer).
   - Analysis: This sentence also follows the SVO order, with ""Pom"" as the subject, ""yahk ja sung"" as the verb phrase, and ""bee-a koo-at yy suk sorng lo"" as the object.

3. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Example: ""Sung rot taaksee reu plow"" (Did you order the taxi? Yes, I did. No, not yet).
   - Analysis: The question ""Sung rot taaksee"" follows the SVO structure, where ""Sung"" is the verb, ""rot"" is the object, and the subject is implied.

4. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example: ""mjKDTOM KYd-1 To boil eggs. filin'YAHNGGYd-1 To roast chicken.""
   - Analysis: These examples are not complete sentences but rather verb phrases. However, they do not contradict the SVO pattern observed in complete sentences.

5. **Paragraph 25**:
   - Example: ""NUK REE-AN TOOK KON AHN NUNGSEU LAAW"" (The book has been read by all the students).
   - Analysis: This sentence is in the passive voice, which complicates direct analysis of SVO order. However, the passive construction ""NUK REE-AN TOOK KON AHN"" (The book has been read by all the students) suggests an underlying SVO structure when converted to active voice.

6. **Paragraph 31**:
   - Example: ""The general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is Subject-Verb-Object as in English.""
   - Analysis: This explicitly states that the general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is SVO.

From these examples, it is clear that the dominant word order in Thai is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

**Conclusion:** SVO",svo,svo

Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), several key points about the word order can be inferred:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the usual word order in Nivkh, explicitly stating that the usual word order is ""topic - embedded clause - adverbials - subject - causee - secondary object - primary object - predicate."" This suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order, with the subject preceding the object and the verb coming last.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph does not directly address the word order but discusses the dependent-head synthesis, which is consistent with head-marking languages that often have SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""Nivkh is a head-marking SOV language (in the sense of Nichols 1986) with a fairly consistent final predicate position."" This directly supports the SOV word order.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides examples of word order with ditransitive verbs, showing the order ""Subject ^ Secondary Object ^ Primary Object-Predicate,"" which aligns with the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the complexity of Nivkh verb forms and mentions that the language is head-marking and configurational, which is often associated with SOV languages.

6. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph provides examples of complex verb forms and their structure, reinforcing the SOV order by showing the verb at the end of the sentence.

7. **Paragraph 30**: This paragraph discusses consonant alternations and their syntactic conditions, which are consistent with the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph discusses the stress patterns in Nivkh, which indirectly supports the SOV order by showing how stress patterns align with the syntactic structure.

### Conclusion

Based on the evidence provided in the paragraphs, the dominant word order in Nivkh (South Sakhalin) is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Jarawa (in Andamans),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, the dominant word order in the language can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Jarawa is an SOV language: the subject precedes the object and the object precedes the verb."" This is a clear and direct statement about the word order in simple sentences with a subject, a single object, and a verb.

2. **Paragraph 2** further supports this by stating that in ditransitive sentences, the overall structure follows SOV order, with the subject preceding the direct object, and the direct object preceding the verb.

3. **Paragraph 3** mentions that the verb follows the object in Jarawa, which aligns with the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that in ditransitive clauses, the subject precedes the objects, and the objects precede the verb, maintaining the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 6** discusses grammatical relations and mentions that word order serves the purpose of differentiating grammatical roles, which implies a reliance on a consistent word order, further suggesting SOV.

6. **Paragraph 13** provides a general schema of a clause in Jarawa, showing the subject followed by the object and then the verb, which is consistent with SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the order of adjectives and possessives, which follow the noun, a common trait in SOV languages.

8. **Paragraph 34** mentions that in complement clauses, the complement clause should precede the verb, which is consistent with an SOV structure.

9. **Paragraph 35** states that peripheral arguments and adpositional phrases precede the verb, which is typical in SOV languages.

10. **Paragraph 50** concludes that Jarawa is an SOV language but notes some deviations in other syntactic structures.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Nahali,"### Reasoning:

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that Udihe exhibits typological features of a head-final SOV language and that the SOV order is the most common statistically. It also provides examples illustrating the typical SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that when the subject bears a focus status, the possible word orders are OSV or SVO. However, this is in the context of specific information structure considerations, suggesting that SOV is the default unless overridden by focus.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that Udihe is a head-final SOV language but mentions that head-finality is not rigid and can be influenced by information structure.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the influence of Russian on Udihe syntax, noting that younger speakers tend to follow Russian word order, which can lead to deviations from the typical SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences in Udihe, all of which follow the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph emphasizes the importance of the preverbal position of the focus element, which typically results in the preverbal position of the object in SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the general principle of Udihe word order, stating that the focused constituent occupies an immediately preverbal position, which aligns with the SOV structure.

8. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph mentions that the SOV order in Udihe is a result of three independent requirements: the preverbal position of the focus, subject/topic initiality, and verb finality. It also notes that while the SOV order appears non-rigid, deviations are motivated by specific information structure requirements.

9. **Paragraph 37**: This paragraph discusses existential constructions and notes that the predicative element may be postposed, which is a recent development influenced by Russian word order.

10. **Paragraph 49**: This paragraph discusses the position of question words in Udihe, noting that they must be placed before the finite predicate, which aligns with the SOV structure.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Udihe is SOV, as it is the most common statistically and is supported by multiple examples and explanations throughout the provided paragraphs. While there are deviations influenced by information structure and Russian word order, SOV remains the default and most frequent order.",sov,sov
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the examples and descriptions of sentence structures in declarative clauses where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: Indicates that Ingush is a head-final language with verb-second order in main clauses, similar to Germanic languages. However, it also mentions that nearly all phrases and non-main clauses are head-final.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Describes the grammatically most basic order of arguments as SV, AOV, and AGTV. It also states that this order is not rigid, and arguments can have different orders relative to each other and the verb in main clauses.

3. **Paragraph 4**: States that Ingush uses verb-final order in non-main and some main clauses, and verb-second order in most main clauses. It provides an example of a pragmatically neutral main clause with verb-final order: ""Suona ghalghaai mott dika xaac"" (I don't know Ingush very well).

4. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that objects regularly reflexivize the coreferential possessor of a subject, showing that object control is not sensitive to word order.

5. **Paragraph 7**: Indicates that quasi-arguments (subcategorized goals and locations) are positioned much like objects, preceding the verb and following the subject.

6. **Paragraph 10**: Provides examples of verb-second order in main clauses, with the verb or the finite part of a compound verb following the first word or phrase in the clause.

7. **Paragraph 11**: Describes existential, locative, and possessive sentences, stating that the basic or neutral order is A patterner + O patterner + V.

8. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the typological overview of Ingush, stating that clause word order is like that of early Germanic: verb-final with frequent verb-second order in main clauses.

9. **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of purpose-clause objects shared with main-clause subjects, showing different word orders.

10. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses obviation and provides examples of configurations that are problematic or ungrammatical, indicating sensitivity to word order in certain contexts.

11. **Paragraph 23**: Provides examples of impossible word orders, indicating constraints on certain configurations.

12. **Paragraph 24**: Describes more complex examples of word order, including content questions and focus structures.

13. **Paragraph 25**: Discusses gender agreement in adjectives and participles, indicating that participles head relative clauses and agree in gender with the S/O in their own valence.

14. **Paragraph 26**: Provides an example of a temporal subordinate clause imposing verb-second order.

15. **Paragraph 27**: Describes content (Wh) questions, indicating that the question word or phrase is usually in immediate preverbal position.

16. **Paragraph 28**: Provides examples of verb-final order in episode-initial clauses and all-new spoken clauses.

17. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses argument sharing in core chaining, indicating that the shared argument is usually in the nominative case.

18. **Paragraph 30**: Describes word order in core chaining, indicating verb-initial order with great consistency.

19. **Paragraph 31**: Discusses notable non-valence-changing processes, indicating that Ingush has no passive and almost no object removal.

20. **Paragraph 32**: Provides examples of narrative chaining, indicating syntactic ergativity with shared arguments variously as S and O.

### Conclusion: No dominant order

The analysis of the provided paragraphs indicates that Ingush exhibits a variety of word orders depending on the clause type, pragmatic context, and syntactic constructions. While verb-final and verb-second orders are common, there is significant flexibility and variation in word order. Therefore, Ingush lacks a single dominant word order.",no dominant order,no dominant order
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can determine the dominant word order by analyzing the information given about the typical placement of subjects, objects, and verbs in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1** states that clause-level word order is generally head-final, meaning verb-final. It mentions that verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent sentences, and alternative orders are possible, especially in colloquial language. However, there is a strong tendency for the subject to precede the other arguments.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples and further discussion on word order, showing that the subject tends to precede the object and the verb in unmarked order. The examples given (e.g., ""Alfija wrote an article"" and ""Mu'minat saw Ibrahim"") follow the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This is illustrated by examples where the verb consistently appears at the end of the sentence.

4. **Paragraph 8** again confirms that the finite verb is typically in the sentence-final position, especially in the written standard language, and provides examples to support this.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while Lezgian allows for some flexibility in word order, the dominant and preferred order in independent declarative sentences, especially in the written standard language, is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the examples and explanations given.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (73): ""assik-ai mikelngu-u-tP Elitnauriste-mA"" translates to ""The teacher likes the children.""
     - Here, the order is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
   - Example (75a): ""Elitnauriste-tA mikelngu-u-tP assik-ait"" translates to ""The teachers like the children.""
     - Again, the order is SOV.
   - Example (75b): ""Mikelngu-u-tA elitnauriste-tP assik-ait"" translates to ""The children like the teachers.""
     - This is also SOV.
   - Example (76): ""Apt-ait mikelgu-u-tA angute-tP"" translates to ""The children asked the men.""
     - This is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the flexibility of word order in CAY (Central Alaskan Yup'ik), indicating that word order is largely free and can be pragmatically conditioned.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (79a): ""TaqukaqP tuqut-aa"" translates to ""He killed the bear.""
     - This is OSV (Object-Subject-Verb).
   - Example (79b): ""[Ik’u-m angute-m]A taqukaqP tuqut-aa"" translates to ""That man across there killed the bear.""
     - This is SOV.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph mentions that word order may be pragmatically conditioned and that any part of a sentence can be fronted as a sentence topic.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (154): ""nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-aqa Nuk’a-mun(A"") arna-mun(A') mikelnguqP=S(A) nayir-mek(P)"" translates to ""I think Nukaq asked the woman to let the child eat a seal.""
     - This is a complex sentence with multiple arguments, showing flexibility in word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (62): ""Akerte-mi=lli puqlanir-paa! ~ Puqlanir-paa=lli akerte-mi!"" translates to ""How warm the sun is!""
     - This shows that word order can vary without changing the meaning.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example (235): ""Yu-u-ngnaqe-llr-atgun tang-lar-aput [qanr-uy-ut-e-mG atu-uci-a]P"" translates to ""We used to see their adhering to/obeying the advice/command in the way they make a living.""
     - This shows a nominal clause split by the main clause, indicating flexibility.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (41): ""muluk’uu-mek"" (ABM.sg.) translates to ""milk.""
     - This is not directly relevant to word order but shows incorporation of loanwords.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (57a): ""pissur-ciqe-nqigg-ni-a"" translates to ""she says that he will go hunting again.""
     - This shows the use of suffixes and their order but does not directly address word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Example (80): ""|kiu[+ћaћլ+ƾa| (answer-IND.3sg.3sg.)"" translates to ""he answers (question) him/her.""
      - This shows verb morphology but not word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the examples and explanations provided in the paragraphs, it is evident that Yup'ik (Norton Sound) exhibits a flexible word order with a tendency towards SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) as the unmarked or more common order. However, the language allows for various word orders depending on pragmatic factors.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Pipil,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, we can determine the dominant word order for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS).
   - VOS order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest frequency in texts and conversation and is the only order for transitive sentences neutral with respect to focus and emphasis.
   - Examples of VOS order:
     - ""ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin"" (The little man put down his jacket).
     - ""mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe"" (The youngest son has given you (pl.) the advice).
   - Other orders like SVO and VSO also occur but with less frequency and specific pragmatic contexts.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The order of modifiers is clear. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify: Adjective-Noun (Adj.-N).
   - Adverbs nearly always precede intransitive and follow transitive verbs: Adverb-Intransitive Verb (Adv.-i.v.), Transitive Verb-Adverb (t.v.-Adv.).

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Intransitive sentences rarely deviate from the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order.
   - Transitive sentences with pronominal subjects or objects often show Verb-Object (VO) or Verb-Subject (VS) orders.

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Orders OV and SV occur but only to emphasize the object or the subject, respectively.
   - Examples:
     - ""mas bién i-kwit turuh ni-k-kwah"" (Rather it was cow's excrement that I ate).
     - ""ne nu-sapatus n-yu ni-k-tamu:ta"" (I'm going to throw away my shoes).

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - The order of verbal affixes in transitive verbs is: pron.subject(+directional)+pron.object+root+tense/asp.(+number).

### Conclusion

Based on the information provided, the dominant word order for Pipil in declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is **Verb-Object-Subject (VOS)**. This order is noted to be the most frequent and neutral with respect to focus and emphasis in texts and conversation.

**Conclusion: VOS**",no dominant order,vos
Micmac,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Micmac, we can infer the following:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that both the object and subject must appear after the verb stem in some order, suggesting a verb-initial structure.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** discuss the ordering of object and subject markers, indicating that the object marker precedes the subject marker following the verb stem.
3. **Paragraph 5** supports the underlying order of Object-Subject, further suggesting that the object comes before the subject in the structure.
4. **Paragraph 12** describes a structure where noun phrases dominated by the same S (subject) which dominates the V (verb) are copied as right daughters of the V, indicating a verb-initial order.
5. **Paragraph 15** assumes an underlying structure where the subject follows the verb, reinforcing the verb-initial order.
6. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 19** further support the idea that the object is closer to the verb than the subject, indicating a VOS or VSO structure.
7. **Paragraph 43** mentions that in Australian suffixing languages, the order is Verb-Subject Copy-Object Copy, which is similar to the structure described for Micmac, suggesting a verb-initial order.

From these observations, it is clear that the verb typically comes first, followed by the object and then the subject. This aligns with the **VOS** (Verb-Object-Subject) word order.

### Conclusion:
VOS",vos,vos
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huehuetla Tepehua, we can analyze the word order in transitive clauses to determine the dominant word order. Here are the key points:

1. **Statistical Analysis of Word Orders**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 provide detailed statistical data on word orders in transitive clauses. The most frequent orders with two overt arguments are SVO (39.5%) and VSO (34.2%), followed by OVS (13.2%) and VOS (10.5%). OSV and SOV are very rare or non-existent.
   - When only one argument is present, VO (65.3%) is significantly more common than OV (18.1%), VS (10.3%), and SV (6.3%).

2. **Pragmatically Neutral Clauses**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that pragmatically neutral clauses collected during elicitation follow the VSO word order. However, word order tests indicate that both VSO and SVO are dominant orders, with a slight statistical preference for SVO.

3. **Examples from Natural Discourse**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 provide examples from natural discourse, showing that SVO and VSO are the most frequent word orders. Examples include:
     - SVO: ""pero [juu lapanak]SUB [tzukulhch 7utaynin]VERB [juu xaakamiti juu 7ani7 x7ilht'i p'aax]OBJ"" (‘But the people began to smell the odor of the pig excrement.’)
     - VSO: ""[tamaqatz'anqaa]VERB [juu lapanak]SUB [juu xlaktaxtoqta]OBJ"" (‘The people lost their things.’)

4. **Conclusion from Statistical and Pragmatic Data**:
   - The statistical data and examples from natural discourse indicate that both SVO and VSO orders are prevalent, with SVO being slightly more frequent. This suggests that Huehuetla Tepehua has a flexible word order with a preference for SVO and VSO.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Musqueam,"To determine the dominant word order in Musqueam, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for relevant information about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

**Paragraph 2:**
This paragraph mentions ""Types of VP, Subject NP and Object NP,"" which indicates a discussion about verb phrases, subject noun phrases, and object noun phrases. However, it does not provide specific examples or details about their order.

**Paragraph 14:**
This paragraph discusses the structure of verb phrases and the roles of subjects and objects. It mentions that ""nominals are usually the subject and/or object of each verb,"" but it does not specify their order relative to the verb.

**Paragraph 16:**
This paragraph provides a crucial piece of information: ""Pluralized objects with and their subjects occur, but formulae tVj,g-O-S,,P verbs: subjects-S,-O0, S, only asplAN always agreement pluralized these almost requires in number bet-and O is obligatory shown in the (A Nee ypl?"" This suggests that the order of elements in a sentence can be SVO (subject-verb-object), as it mentions subjects and objects in relation to verbs.

**Paragraph 42:**
This paragraph is highly relevant as it states: ""O Vt-0-439 a subject, 0. the SleS Vi. preceded is verb by an lacking Vt-0. article the same-es as derives ait) Vt-0-4.9 a. when Ey subject is suffix are attested). and then both is the subjunctive O-es attested); structures the verb (sk?f{-4.6 A O-es.); perhaps (S). suffix the be to 1£)-4.9b sentence be appears subject three (S Vt-0?f or 1f before which are when Ey verb; that auxiliary (or the verb object, also preceding while of a verb takes (underlined) Ey Bel."" This indicates that the subject (S) precedes the verb (V) and the object (O) follows the verb, suggesting an SVO order.

**Reasoning:**
Based on the information from Paragraphs 16 and 42, it appears that the typical order in Musqueam declarative sentences is SVO. Paragraph 16 explicitly mentions the SVO order, and Paragraph 42 provides further support by describing sentence structures where the subject precedes the verb and the object follows it.

**Conclusion:**
SVO",vso,svo
Omaha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Omaha by focusing on the relevant information about the structure of sentences, particularly those involving subjects, objects, and verbs.

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after their nouns, whether these are subject or object. This is entirely different than in English, where object nouns normally come after their verb. Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught (transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse (object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].""
   - This paragraph clearly indicates that the verb follows both the subject and the object, suggesting an SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 38**:
   - ""11.9 Noun–Active Verb Word Order• A noun can be modified by a verb. When this happens in English, we put the verb in front of the noun. In Omaha, the verb follows the noun.""
   - This further supports the idea that verbs follow nouns, reinforcing the SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""In Omaha a verb can stand alone as a complete sentence, without needing a subject in front of it as in English. The subject is implied. This is the Omaha way of saying that he, she or it is doing something.""
   - While this indicates that verbs can stand alone, it does not contradict the SOV order when both subject and object are present.

4. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""Omaha object pronouns are affixed to the front of the verb, just as the subject pronouns are. For Omaha, we call the direct object pronouns the patient pronouns.""
   - This suggests that in the case of pronouns, the structure might differ, but it does not provide evidence against the SOV order for noun subjects and objects.

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - ""The third person singular patient, like the subject, takes no affixed pronoun. The default meaning of a plain transitive verb is: s/he [verb]s/ed him/her.""
   - This indicates that in the absence of pronouns, the verb follows the subject and object, consistent with SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the dominant word order in Washo due to the lack of clear examples of declarative sentences involving both a subject and an object as nouns. The paragraphs primarily discuss morphological and syntactic features such as verb stems, prefixes, and suffixes, but they do not provide explicit information on the typical order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs mention various aspects of verb morphology, including transitive and intransitive verbs, but do not provide clear examples of sentences with both subject and object nouns.
   - There is no direct discussion or examples illustrating the dominant word order in declarative sentences with noun subjects and objects.

Given the absence of explicit information on the dominant word order in the provided text, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order for Washo from these paragraphs.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the most frequent and unmarked order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that the most unmarked word order of a sentence in Koasati is subject, object, verb (SOV). This is a strong indication of the dominant word order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** supports this by mentioning that although Koasati employs nominal cases, the most unmarked word order remains SOV. This suggests that while there might be variations due to focus on the verb or other elements, the default or neutral order is SOV.

3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that the order with the object following the verb (SVO) is quite unusual and occurs only in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the verbal element. This reinforces the idea that SOV is the default order, with SVO being a marked or less common variant.

4. **Paragraph 7** states that the order VSO never seems to occur, which helps narrow down the possibilities and supports the dominance of SOV.

5. **Paragraph 14** further confirms that the most unmarked position for the sentence subject is before the verb in intransitive sentences and before the object in transitive sentences, aligning with the SOV structure.

6. **Paragraph 16** mentions that noun modifiers follow the modified noun, which is consistent with the SOV structure where the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence.

7. **Paragraph 23** and **Paragraph 47** discuss the use of switch-reference markers and focus forms, but these do not contradict the dominant SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov

Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Yuchi (Euchee) can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The basic word order in a two-place verb (transitive clause) is described as Actor (A) then Patient (P), then Verb (V). This corresponds to the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order.
   - Example: ""Sissy Sonny siothashane"" (Sissy loves Sonny) follows the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It reiterates that Euchee is an APV (Actor-Patient-Verb) word order language, which aligns with the SOV structure.
   - Example: ""William le h6'neine je Henry"" (Did Henry see William?) follows the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - It mentions that the affected participant can be at the end of the sentence, but the causer (subject) cannot be sentence-final, reinforcing the SOV structure.

4. **Paragraph 9**:
   - It states that when all three participants are noun phrases, the most common word orders are Actor-Patient-Recipient/Beneficiary and Actor-Recipient/Beneficiary-Patient, which still places the verb at the end, consistent with SOV.

5. **Paragraph 24**:
   - It explicitly states that Euchee has a basic SOV word order.

6. **Paragraph 27**:
   - It provides examples of the A-P-V (SOV) order with 3rd person actors.

7. **Paragraph 47**:
   - It describes the pronominal prefix order on the verb, which follows a P-A-V (Patient-Actor-Verb) structure, consistent with SOV.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, the dominant word order of the language can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 7** indicates that each part of the sentence, except for pronominal subjects and objects, is represented by a phonetically independent unit whose position can be easily shifted without impairing the sense of the sentence. This suggests a flexible word order.

2. **Paragraph 13** mentions that the subject of a sentence may appear in initial, medial, or terminal position, indicating that the subject's position is not fixed.

3. **Paragraph 18** states that the nominal object must appear after the verb but may precede or follow the subject of the sentence. This implies that the object tends to follow the verb, but the subject's position relative to the verb and object can vary.

4. **Paragraph 39** notes that the verb appears in terminal position in all such cases, suggesting a tendency for the verb to come at the end of the sentence.

5. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss the independence and flexibility of certain elements within the sentence, reinforcing the idea of a non-rigid word order.

Given these observations, it appears that Alsea does not have a rigid or dominant word order. The flexibility in the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs, as well as the emphasis on the verb often appearing at the end, suggests that no single word order predominates in the language.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",not mentioned in the grammar,no dominant order
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, the information relevant to determining the dominant word order is quite sparse. However, there are a few key points that can be extracted:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the order of word parts remains the same in negative and declarative sentences. This suggests that there is a consistent word order in declarative sentences, but it does not specify what that order is.

2. **Paragraph 10** states that modes in Arikara are expressed by prefixes to the verb and do not require changes in word order in the sentence. This implies that the word order is relatively fixed and not influenced by the mode of the verb.

3. **Paragraph 11** describes a class of verbs where the subject is affected by the verb, and what is the subject in English translation is the object in Arikara inflection. This indicates that the subject-object relationship might be different from English, but it does not provide a clear word order.

4. **Paragraph 27** mentions that the indicative mode in Arikara is used to make a simple statement of fact and is marked by a prefix. This again suggests a fixed word order in declarative sentences but does not specify the order.

5. **Paragraph 10** also mentions that Arikara does not require changes in word order for different modes, which suggests a relatively fixed word order.

Despite these hints, none of the paragraphs explicitly state the dominant word order of subject, object, and verb in Arikara. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to definitively determine the dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",no dominant order,not mentioned in the grammar
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, there is no clear evidence to determine the dominant word order (SOV, SVO, VOS, VSO, OVS, OSV) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. The paragraphs primarily discuss morphological and phonological aspects of the language, such as verb morphology, suffixes, and inflectional patterns, without providing explicit examples of sentence structure involving both a subject and an object.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss verb morphology, suffixes, and phonological features without providing clear examples of sentence structure.
   - There is no explicit mention or examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns that would allow for the determination of a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Jemez,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Jemez. Here are the key observations:

1. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example: ""Mary gya John be16 Q-0-h6"" (Mary rep John bread tben[3sg:3sg]-basbake/pf)
   - This sentence translates to ""Mary said that John baked the bread.""
   - The structure here is S (Mary) - O (John) - V (bake).

2. **Paragraph 40**:
   - Example: ""v&la dPli f&"" (man chicken tr[3sg:3has]-kill/pf)
   - This translates to ""A man killed a chicken.""
   - The structure here is S (man) - O (chicken) - V (kill).

3. **Paragraph 25**:
   - Example: ""d6- S6- tat&&"" (that man tr[ l sg:3bas]-punchlpf)
   - This translates to ""I punched that man.""
   - The structure here is S (I) - O (that man) - V (punch).

4. **Paragraph 28**:
   - Example: ""nf qmf'A man killed a chicken."" (man chicken tr[3sg:3has]-kill/pf)
   - The structure here is S (man) - O (chicken) - V (kill).

From these examples, it is evident that the dominant word order in Jemez is consistently Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Each example provided follows this pattern, indicating that SOV is the dominant word order in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

### Conclusion:
SOV",not mentioned in the grammar,sov
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that focus movement restores SOV order and that OSV word order occurs in other contexts, suggesting that SOV might be the basic order.
2. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that Zuni clauses containing only lexical NP arguments follow an SOV order.
3. **Paragraph 10** states that Zuni word order is strict SOV in the sense that the verb must appear finally in its clause, indicating a strong preference for SOV order.
4. **Paragraph 24** reiterates that in Zuni, the verb occurs finally and strictly so, reinforcing the SOV order.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that the dominant word order in Zuni is SOV, especially when both the subject and object are nouns.

### Reasoning:
- **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 3** both indicate that SOV is the basic order when dealing with lexical NP arguments.
- **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 24** emphasize that the verb must appear finally in the clause, which is a characteristic feature of SOV languages.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Rama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Rama can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Rama is an SOV language and that the word order is relatively rigid.
2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates the SOV word order of the language.
3. **Paragraph 10** states that Rama has verb-final word order, which is typical of SOV languages.
4. **Paragraph 14** also supports the verb-final nature of the language, aligning with SOV order.
5. **Paragraph 15** explicitly mentions that the basic word order of Rama is SOV.
6. **Paragraph 17** provides an example of SOV word order in a text excerpt.
7. **Paragraph 48** confirms that Rama is an SOV language, similar to Miskitu and Sumu.

These multiple references and examples consistently indicate that the dominant word order in Rama is SOV.

**Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
Tonkawa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tonkawa, we can deduce the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject, object and verb.""
   - This explicitly states that the typical order is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""This sentence illustrates the usual word order in Tonkawa: subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal verb.""
   - This reinforces the SOV order, with additional modifiers and subordinated verbs.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example: ""'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o' The bad dog severely bit a big man.""
   - Here, the structure is SOV: 'egwan (subject) - ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak (object) - nadj-o' (verb).

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example: ""da'ane-da yagda-k-wam-y'ik taking it to where they sat.""
   - This example does not directly illustrate SOV but shows the use of verbs and objects in a complex sentence structure.

5. **Paragraph 23**:
   - Example: ""hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o he lay crying, it is said.""
   - This example shows a verb-final structure, consistent with SOV.

6. **Paragraph 24**:
   - Example: ""ha'djcogonai-la xa'xaklakno'o a young woman arrived, it is said.""
   - This example does not directly illustrate SOV but shows the use of verbs at the end of clauses.

7. **Paragraph 27**:
   - Example: ""hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o he lay crying, it is said.""
   - This example shows a verb-final structure, consistent with SOV.

8. **Paragraph 28**:
   - Example: ""ha'djcogonai-la xa'xaklakno'o a young woman arrived, it is said.""
   - This example does not directly illustrate SOV but shows the use of verbs at the end of clauses.

9. **Paragraph 29**:
   - Example: ""hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o he lay crying, it is said.""
   - This example shows a verb-final structure, consistent with SOV.

10. **Paragraph 30**:
    - Example: ""ha'djcogonai-la xa'xaklakno'o a young woman arrived, it is said.""
    - This example does not directly illustrate SOV but shows the use of verbs at the end of clauses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit statement in Paragraph 1 and the consistent examples provided in other paragraphs, the dominant word order in Tonkawa is **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can analyze the word order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph mentions that the independent object normally follows the independent subject if both are expressed in the same clause. This suggests an SOV order.
   - Example: ""(1s) ta’rustaéku,(10) to’mahkak(pw)?uwe’niwthé (14421)"" translates to ""when Rabbit found the alligator,"" where Rabbit (S) precedes the alligator (O), and the verb ""found"" (V) comes last.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph indicates a tendency to place the predicative word (verb) at the end of the sentence or clause, although this order is not rigidly adhered to.
   - Example: ""(sc) hinya’tthé, (1s) tu’wak (pw) ?u'wako'ni.(20:e)"" translates to ""Then the owl hooted, it is said,"" where the owl (S) precedes the verb ""hooted"" (V).

3. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph provides examples of simple sentences where the predicative word (verb) is placed at the end.
   - Example: ""(1s) ha’yistku, (10) to’niku, (Pw) ?uhka'lin?uhke'nt. (6c:a)"" translates to ""The One Above created man, it is said,"" where ""The One Above"" (S) precedes ""man"" (O), and the verb ""created"" (V) comes last.

4. **Paragraph 31**: This paragraph discusses the order of clauses and provides an example where the main clause takes the sentence-final position.
   - Example: ""(pwipc-l) ?uso'liyu’kawithé, (pc: pc-2) ?usu’éiwan (Pw: Dc-2) ya'wihé, (1s:pc-3) ri’hkuya’hon (pw:pc-3) wa'hkawthé (pm: pco-4) hih (pw: pc-4) po’wihé, (Is: Mc) ya’?an, (Pw: MC) ka'l?ura’ni. (20:a)"" translates to ""When he arrived and crept up on him, when he was about to shoot him, when a limb cracked, when he looked there, a deer was standing, it is said."" Here, the subject ""he"" (S) precedes the object ""him"" (O), and the verb ""arrived"" (V) comes last.

5. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the subject precedes the verb.
   - Example: ""(1s) to'kate’kahdku, tiya'’nako’nit. (44:q)"" translates to ""The orphan boy spoke to her, it is said,"" where ""The orphan boy"" (S) precedes the verb ""spoke"" (V).

From these examples, it is evident that the typical word order in Tunica is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). The subject generally precedes the object, and the verb tends to be placed at the end of the clause.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Wappo by examining the structure of sentences and the position of the subject (S), object (O), and verb (V). Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the position of personal pronouns, indicating that they usually appear before the verb, with the pronominal subject preceding the object. This suggests a tendency towards SOV order when pronouns are involved.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Provides examples of sentences where the verb appears at the end:
   - ""he'ku mai'hotco'halanuma?"" (Is this where one walks along?)
   - ""tu'pulu e'yEma tet'u'tvknoma, tse i'si mul tc*aki'lta"" (then her beaded belt that she had wrapped around herself, that we took off)
   - ""tse'te an t'o'enama"" (by means of that he kills people)
   - ""pa't*a tse k'e'tci te-ole'oknoma tc'ak'e'tcittsta"" (and he cut them where they were tied)

3. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions the position of words in the sentence, stating that the verb is always last except occasionally when nouns in the instrumental case follow it. Examples include:
   - ""pa't.a hu't'asi lelho'tsu mai'opo'nta"" (then coyote locked himself up in the hole of a rock)
   - ""pa't*a hu't'asi k'a'pe ha'ota"" (then coyote picked up the feathers)
   - ""tse'pi k-a'naci po'le ne'eke"" (he the Indian had a boy)
   - ""o'na eole'kuma make'kdta me'yu"" (again he threw the fish-line in the water)
   - ""tseka'li me'yu menata'ake"" (thus he got in the water)

Yurok,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, we can analyze the word order patterns to determine the dominant word order. Here are the key points from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that Yurok word order is flexible and that the order of words in a sentence can vary depending on emphasis and context rather than strict syntactic rules. This suggests that there is no rigid word order.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of adverbs and preverbs, indicating some flexibility in their placement relative to the verb. However, it does not provide specific information about the order of subject, object, and verb.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph explains the classification of verbs based on transitivity but does not provide information about the dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph describes verbs and their inflection but does not address the order of subject, object, and verb.

5. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph provides examples of bipersonal verbs but does not specify the order of subject, object, and verb.

6. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph is crucial as it discusses the positioning of nouns relative to verbs. It states that it is uncommon for a sentence to have more than one noun and that if there is a noun, it may be positioned either before or after its verb. It also mentions that no more than one noun will be positioned before the verb, and any additional nouns will be positioned after the verb. This suggests a high degree of flexibility in noun positioning.

7. **Paragraph 42**: This paragraph provides examples of how verbs with the root ""son-"" are used, but it does not provide information about the dominant word order.

8. **Paragraph 43**: This paragraph discusses relative roots but does not address the order of subject, object, and verb.

9. **Paragraph 44**: This paragraph discusses the use of passives but does not provide information about the dominant word order.

10. **Paragraph 45**: This paragraph discusses possessive prefixes but does not address the order of subject, object, and verb.

11. **Paragraph 46**: This paragraph discusses the formation of passives but does not provide information about the dominant word order.

12. **Paragraph 47**: This paragraph discusses specific verb types but does not address the order of subject, object, and verb.

13. **Paragraph 48**: This paragraph provides an example of a verb of perception but does not provide information about the dominant word order.

14. **Paragraph 49**: This paragraph explains special symbols used in the grammar but does not address the order of subject, object, and verb.

15. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph provides examples of verbs with specific endings but does not provide information about the dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, particularly from Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 41, it is clear that Yurok exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, and there is no strict syntactic rule governing the order of subject, object, and verb. Therefore, the dominant word order in Yurok cannot be determined as one specific order.

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Nuuchahnulth,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Nuuchahnulth by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (180)c: ""c@brFh w`cF`vhp x@c`p`vhp"" translates to ""The woman sees the baby.""
     - Structure: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)

### Conclusion:
SVO",no dominant order,svo
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Columbia-Wenatchi, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**

- **Paragraph 1:** States that the direct object ""ttw’it"" (boy) follows the predicate, and the subject ""kiy’dna?"" (girl) is in the final position, indicating a VOS order. It mentions that this represents the unmarked word order.
  
- **Paragraph 3:** Reiterates that the basic transitive word order is VOS, although there is some flexibility. It provides an example (54) with VOS order: ""t’dq’s wa t’aq’-nt-s ttw’it Panikiy’ana?"" (The girl slapped the boy).

- **Paragraph 4:** Confirms that simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive sentences and the unmarked VOS for transitive clauses. It notes that VSO constructions are also possible but less frequent.

- **Paragraph 5:** Mentions that Nxa?amxcin can have various word order combinations, but VOS appears to be the unmarked order.

- **Paragraph 6:** States that VSO ordering is possible but not as frequent as VOS, reinforcing that VOS is the dominant order.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while there is some flexibility in word order, the unmarked and most frequently occurring order in transitive clauses is VOS.

2. **Conclusion:** VOS",vos,vos
Hidatsa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hidatsa, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of transitive clauses where both the subject (S) and object (O) are overtly expressed as nouns.

**Paragraph 1:**
- The passage mentions that the unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). This suggests a preference for the SOV order in transitive clauses when both arguments are overtly expressed.
- Example (36) shows a narrative where the subject and object are introduced, but it does not provide a clear transitive clause example with both noun arguments.

**Paragraph 2:**
- This paragraph discusses ditransitive verbs and mentions that direct objects are disambiguated from indirect objects mainly by word order. However, it does not provide a clear example of a transitive clause with both subject and object as nouns.

**Paragraph 10:**
- This paragraph provides an example (29a) where the ergative suffix -hiri identifies the word icúùwasga (horse) as the agent. The example sentence ""Icúùwasghiri badhíheec"" translates to ""The horse bucked him off,"" which follows the SOV order (Subject-Agent-Verb).

**Paragraph 15:**
- This paragraph discusses the agentivity scale and provides examples (40a and 40b) where the order of arguments is not important since the A-argument is always disambiguated by its higher ranking. Both examples follow the SOV order:
  - (40a) ""Buusíhgees íìdahu ágsiac"" translates to ""The cat caught a mouse.""
  - (40b) ""Íìdahu ágsiac buusíhgees"" translates to ""The cat caught a mouse.""

**Paragraph 11:**
- This paragraph provides examples of causative constructions with three arguments, but it does not provide clear examples of simple transitive clauses with both subject and object as nouns.

**Paragraph 35:**
- This paragraph discusses the combinations of agent and object affixes on transitive verbs and mentions that the B-set object prefix always precedes the A-set agent prefix. However, it does not provide clear examples of transitive clauses with both subject and object as nouns.

From the analysis, the most relevant information comes from Paragraphs 1, 10, and 15, which consistently indicate that the unmarked or preferred word order in Hidatsa transitive clauses is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Toqabaqita can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""In verbal clauses the basic order is SVX and AVOX, where S represents an intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, O a direct object, and V a verb.""
   - Example (3-5): ""Nau ku riki-a doqora-mu i maa-na uusi-a."" translates to ""I saw your brother at the market place.""
     - Here, the structure is S (Nau) V (ku riki-a) O (doqora-mu).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (14-18): ""Kera thaitoqoma-na wela nau kamareqa."" translates to ""They know my child and me.""
     - Here, the structure is S (Kera) V (thaitoqoma-na) O (wela nau kamareqa).

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""With the exception of the type of interrogative with inverted, [verb.phrase subject] order and one other type of sentence where the verb comes before the subject (negative existential sentences), verbs cannot occur before their subjects, whether in interrogatives or elsewhere.""
   - Example (19-42): ""Era ba=e qufita naqa?"" translates to ""How is the fire now?""
     - This indicates that the normal order is not VSO or VOS.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (4-110): ""kuqu-fi (normal word) ‘drink’"" and ""qingo-fi (respectful word) ‘drink’""
     - This indicates that verbs typically follow subjects.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - ""The sequential subject markers are also used when a preceding clause expresses a potential, contemplated, expected, or attempted situation that did not, in fact, materialize.""
   - Example (16-23): ""Kera ade douri-asa PURP-3.OBJ IRR keki raqu-a, ma ka qafetaqi."" translates to ""They attempted to catch it [a bird], but it was (too) difficult.""
     - Here, the structure is S (Kera) V (ade douri-asa) O (keki raqu-a).

6. **Paragraph 31**:
   - Example (3-18): ""Nau ku rongo-a kini qeri."" translates to ""I heard the woman.""
     - Here, the structure is S (Nau) V (ku rongo-a) O (kini qeri).

From these examples, it is evident that the typical structure in Toqabaqita for declarative sentences with both subject and object as nouns is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the examples and statements about typical sentence structures.

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""the default order is SOV,"" indicating that the most common or neutral word order in Aghu is Subject-Object-Verb.

2. **Paragraph 3** supports this by stating, ""Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb."" This reinforces the idea that SOV is the typical structure.

3. **Paragraph 1** mentions instances where the object precedes the subject, but these are noted as exceptions influenced by topicality, suggesting that such deviations are not the norm.

4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 22** discuss case markers and their optional use, which can help disambiguate roles in sentences but do not fundamentally alter the dominant SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 39** provides an example where the subject precedes the object and the verb, consistent with SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 47** and **Paragraph 46** further illustrate the typical SOV structure in examples of verbal clauses.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Manambu by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example 20.68a: ""wun m@n-a:m vi ma:"" translates to ""I will not hit you,"" showing SOV order.
   - Example 20.68b: ""m@n-a:m wun vi ma:"" translates to ""I will not hit you,"" showing OAV order, which is a variation but still verb-final.

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - It mentions that constituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb-final in main clauses and almost exclusively so in dependent clauses. This suggests a tendency towards SOV or OAV orders.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example 20.69: ""d@-k@-di ñan-ugw kur-taka wula-taka Apur Iraman [a vya-d@-d] [Iraman vya-d@-k]"" translates to ""Having taken his children, having entered (the battlefield), Iraman hit Apur (not anyone else), after Iraman had hit him,"" showing SOV order.
   - Example 20.70: ""al@k [klada ta:kw-a]O [d@ k@-d@ ñan-a-d@ ñanA kra-kwa-d]"" translates to ""That is why it is this woman down there (that) he this son of ours may marry,"" showing OAV order, which is verb-final.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Table 20.1 shows that the order of constituents in Manambu is verb-final in both copula clauses and clauses with non-verbal predicates, reinforcing the verb-final tendency.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example 20.57: ""b@r awuk"" translates to ""You (two) listen!"" showing verb-final order in imperative clauses.
   - Example 20.61: ""k@ kamna:gw vyakat ma:"" translates to ""Is this food not good?"" showing verb-final order in interrogative clauses.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example 20.1: ""k@-na-wur k@-d@-wul t@p-ad"" translates to ""It is this-previously mentioned village upstream, this-away from the river big village,"" showing verb-final order.

7. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example 20.52a: ""ñ@n-a kamna:gw k@ka"" translates to ""Here is your food,"" showing verb-final order in verbless clauses.

8. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Table 3.5 and the discussion indicate that the subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb, and the object (O) can be cross-referenced if topical, suggesting a verb-final structure.

9. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Table 20.1 and the discussion confirm that the order of constituents in Manambu is predominantly verb-final.

10. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Example 20.23: ""day vak@r-@k ata kur-di"" translates to ""They then were about to fall down,"" showing verb-final order in complex predicates.

11. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Example 20.10: ""wun-a-di ñan-ugw d@y-a-k@ kwasa gwa:l Abasadu"" translates to ""Abasadu, the little classiﬁcatory granddaughter of my children with Demiyawi, Gabelmag, Yapikudi (and) father, together we went (that time),"" showing verb-final order in coordinated noun phrases.

12. **Paragraph 13**:
    - Example 14.20: ""d@ ma: n@bay yæy"" translates to ""He has not come yet,"" showing verb-final order in negative constructions.

13. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Example 20.1: ""k@-na-wur k@-d@-wul t@p-ad"" translates to ""It is this-previously mentioned village upstream, this-away from the river big village,"" showing verb-final order in noun phrases.

14. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Example 20.3: ""d@ a-d@ kabay ad@ka yi-ta:y bal l@-k@-k kam@k m@wi vya-n karya-d r@-k@-na wa-ta:y"" translates to ""That very one (previously mentioned) (topical",sov,not mentioned in the grammar
Momu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Momu can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""the basic word order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V"" and further clarifies that ""all participants in a clause typically occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering."" This indicates a strong preference for a subject-object-verb (SOV) structure in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

2. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of bivalent clauses (which include a subject and an object) and explicitly shows the order as subject, object, and verb (SOV). For instance, ""Flerwick ie=m kuw"" translates to ""Flerwick ate fish,"" where ""Flerwick"" is the subject, ""fish"" is the object, and ""ate"" is the verb, following the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 8** discusses the ordering of participants and confirms that the typical, pragmatically unmarked ordering of participants relative to the predicate in a clause is ""Subject > Object(s) > Oblique(s) > Adjunct(s) (> Predicate)."" This reinforces the SOV structure as the dominant order.

4. **Paragraph 10** mentions that the verb pair ""no/tu ‘give one/many’"" is the only case where two objects occur, and there is no general preference for the ordering of the two objects in the clause. However, it confirms that both objects occur after the subject, which aligns with the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of trivalent clauses and shows that the subject precedes the objects and the verb, consistent with the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 19** explicitly states that ""Generally speaking, all participants occur before the final predicate,"" and provides examples that follow the SOV structure.

7. **Paragraph 27** discusses the order of genitive noun phrases and possessed nouns but also provides examples of transitive clauses that follow the SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 28** defines generalised argument roles and confirms that subjects and objects follow the SOV order in clauses.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov

Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Motuna, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of transitive verbal clauses where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""Word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors."" It also states that ""SV, OAV, and AOV are commonly found constituent orders in my corpus."" This indicates some flexibility in word order but suggests that the verb tends to come last.

2. **Paragraph 3** provides a table (Table 3-1) summarizing the basic word order of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses. The orders listed include:
   - O(ABS)A(ERG)VP
   - A(ERG)O(ABS)VP
   - A(ABS)O(ABS)VP
   - O(ABS)!11VP
   - A(ERG)!11VP
   - !11!11VP0, or unexpressed A

   This indicates that the verb (V) consistently appears at the end of the clause, suggesting a verb-final structure.

3. **Paragraph 4** reinforces that ""the basic word order and case-markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses"" involve the verb appearing at the end of the clause.

4. **Paragraph 8** states that ""When A is in ergative case, word order is free. However, when A is in absolutive case, A must precede O."" This suggests that while there is some flexibility, there is a tendency for the subject to precede the object when both are in absolutive case.

5. **Paragraph 14** mentions that ""The order of NP constituents and verbs given here is the unmarked one, although almost any constituents can be placed in different order or be left unexpressed, due to discourse factors."" This implies that the unmarked (or default) order is what we should consider as the dominant order.

From these observations, it is clear that the verb (V) consistently appears at the end of the clause, and the subject (S) tends to precede the object (O) when both are in absolutive case. Therefore, the dominant word order in Motuna is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Dla (Menggwa),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Menggwa Dla, several key points can be extracted to determine the dominant word order:

1. **Verb-Final Clauses**:
   - Paragraph 3: ""Most clauses are verb-final, and the order amongst the free constituents (noun phrases and other words) before the verb is free.""
   - Paragraph 6: ""Clauses are most usually verb-final, and the order of the constituents in front of the clause is free.""

2. **Examples of Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 5: ""When there are (pro)nominals in a clause, the verb is placed after all the (pro)nominals.""
     - Example 5-139: ""yo=pa ilohe (< ilo-ha-a-hi). 1=only work-1SG-3FSG:O-PRES:CONT ‘Only I work (here).’ (S)""
     - Example 5-140: ""hwifiha-hya-aØ-numb-a-mbo, water fetch.water-1SG-3FSG:O CR-SEQ-1SG-DEP ‘I fetch water, and…’ (B)""

3. **Flexibility in Constituent Order**:
   - Paragraph 5: ""When there is more than one (pro)nominal present in a clause, their relative order is free.""
     - Example 5-141: ""hilari ufatisimi-Ø-hya.""

4. **Post-Verbal Constituents**:
   - Paragraph 3: ""Nevertheless, one constituent can occupy the post-verbal position; this constituent further specifies the identity of a reference mentioned earlier in the clause (or sometimes in previous clauses).""

5. **Examples with Multiple Nominals**:
   - Paragraph 12: ""In the following examples, the object precedes the subject. The order of the object and subject nominals can also be interchanged freely.""
     - Example 5-144: ""wali Vincent na-ya-a pig fa-Ø-ya-a-mbo, Vincent shoot-3SG-3FSG:O COMPL-CR-3SG-3FSG:O-DEP ‘Vincent shot the pig, and then…’""
     - Example 5-145: ""rani amnibaya tupam nyawi hihiri fa-Ø-ya-a-Ø, DEM garden side thing person steal COMPL-CR-3SG-3FSG:O-DEP ‘Someone was stealing things at the garden, and…’""

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided, Menggwa Dla predominantly follows a **verb-final** structure in its clauses, with flexibility in the order of the subject and object before the verb. This aligns with the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, which is common among verb-final languages. The flexibility mentioned does not negate the dominance of the verb-final structure, as the verb consistently appears at the end of the clause.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can extract several key points regarding the typical word order in Duna:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""In typical word order, subject argument NPs are clause-initial. Object NPs typically follow subject NPs.""
   - This suggests a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.

2. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""The general template of an object-verb predication is represented in Figure 7.5.""
   - The template shows (NPsubject) (NPobject) Verb, reinforcing the SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""The typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause is summarized in Figure 4.2.""
   - The figure shows (NPsubject) (NPobject) Predicate, again indicating an SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Temporal expressions quite commonly follow a subject NP and precede an object NP.""
   - This further supports the SOV structure, as temporal expressions are inserted between the subject and object.

5. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""An ‘object-verb predication’ is one in which a nominal phrase occupies the P argument slot of a consonantal or wa-class bivalent verb.""
   - This description aligns with the SOV order where the object precedes the verb.

6. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Subjects typically precede other constituents in unmarked order.""
   - This statement supports the subject-initial position, consistent with SOV.

7. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""An object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.""
   - While this indicates flexibility for pragmatic reasons, it does not contradict the typical SOV order.

8. **Paragraph 4**:
   - ""The typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause is summarized in Figure 4.2.""
   - The figure shows (NPsubject) (NPobject) Predicate, reinforcing the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Duna is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kanum (Ngkâlmpw), the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Ngkolmpu is largely a verb-final language,"" and further clarifies that in pragmatically neutral circumstances, there is a strong tendency to order the constituents as AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). This directly suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order, as the agent (A) here is equivalent to the subject (S).

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions that word order is too flexible to be a reliable diagnostic due to its sensitivity to pragmatic constraints such as topicality, animacy, and argument saliency. However, it does not contradict the SOV order suggested in Paragraph 2.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides an example sentence: ""Markus pr pi storui"" (Markus-ERG tree 3.ABS SG>3.HOD.PFV\cut.PFV), which translates to ""Markus cut the log (earlier today)."" This example follows the SOV order, with ""Markus"" as the subject, ""tree"" as the object, and ""cut"" as the verb.

4. **Paragraph 14** discusses cognate-object constructions and provides examples that align with the SOV structure, such as ""ngko aeibentai teibentai"" (I told the story), where ""ngko"" (I) is the subject, ""aeibentai"" (story) is the object, and ""teibentai"" (told) is the verb.

5. **Paragraph 22** provides examples of nominal constructions but does not directly address the order of subject, object, and verb in a clause.

6. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 6** discuss various aspects of nominal syntax and case marking but do not provide clear evidence against the SOV order.

7. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 7** discuss morphological and syntactic structures without providing direct evidence on the dominant word order.

8. **Paragraph 10** provides an example of an interrogative sentence: ""mne krar Markus srampui?"" (Which dog bit Markus?), which follows the SOV order.

Given the strong evidence from Paragraph 2 and the supporting examples from other paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that the dominant word order in Kanum (Ngkâlmpw) is SOV.

### Conclusion:

   - This indicates that Maybrat, as a WPP language, follows the SVO word order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Maybrat word order is SVO, see Chapter 6.""
   - This explicitly states that Maybrat follows the SVO word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""The order of constituents, SVO, is rigid.""
   - This confirms that the SVO order is not only present but also rigid in Maybrat.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Examples like ""m-kai ru"" (3U-find bird) and ""m-ape ku"" (3U-carry.on.back child) show the verb preceding the object, consistent with SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Although the SVO word order in Maybrat is very rigid, there is a notable variation whereby the object is placed in clause-initial position.""
   - This indicates that while SVO is dominant, there are instances of topicalization where the object can be fronted, but this does not negate the dominance of SVO.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""Topicalised objects are separated from the rest of the clause by a pause, and they are dominated by their own intonation contour.""
   - This further supports that topicalization is a marked structure, reinforcing that SVO is the unmarked, dominant order.

7. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""The order of constituents in the NP is rigid.""
   - This suggests that the word order within noun phrases is also fixed, aligning with the overall rigidity of SVO in clauses.

8. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Examples like ""t-e am"" (1S-give letter) and ""t-e 1S-give"" (I give) show the verb preceding the object, consistent with SVO order.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**

The dominant word order in Maybrat is SVO, as evidenced by multiple explicit statements and examples in the provided paragraphs.",svo,svo
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Asmat language, it is challenging to determine the dominant word order directly. The paragraphs focus heavily on morphological aspects, such as suffixes, prefixes, and the structure of verbs, rather than providing clear examples of declarative sentences with both noun subjects and objects.

However, some observations can be made:

1. **Morphological Focus**: The grammar places significant emphasis on the morphological structure of verbs, including the order of suffixes indicating the category, object, and subject. This suggests a complex verb morphology that might influence word order, but it does not provide direct evidence of the dominant word order in declarative sentences.

2. **Lack of Clear Examples**: The provided paragraphs do not include clear examples of transitive sentences with both noun subjects and objects in a declarative context. This makes it difficult to infer the dominant word order from the given information.

3. **Verb-Subject-Object Markers**: There are mentions of suffixes indicating the subject and object categories, but these are more related to verb morphology than to the syntactic order of constituents in a sentence.

Given the lack of direct evidence and examples of declarative sentences with clear subject, object, and verb constituents, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order of Asmat from the provided information.

Kuot,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. Here are the relevant observations from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (2): ""IntransitiveTransitiveI.subj. enclitic obj. prefixpasei=oŋ talk=3mS ‘he talks’a-pasei=oŋ 3mO-talk=3mS ‘he talks of him/it(m)’ or ‘he tells him’""
   - Example (24): ""[nǝmo o-u-uluan] [i-tie non kuraima] nirobu want 3fO-3mS-follow 3m-there ‘some’ bush.spirit(m) coconut.palm(f) ‘this bush spirit wanted to follow the coconut palm (up)’""

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (6): ""a. me-la=r mǝn u-pit=meŋ ma lǝp 3pS-go=ASP CONT dummy.O-cut.firewood=3pS 3p.PossI firewood.nsg ‘they went (and) cut firewood’; ‘they went firewood-cutting’ b. me-la ma-pit=meŋ lǝp 3pS-go 3pO-cut.firewood=3pS firewood.nsg ‘they went (and) cut (the) firewood’""

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example (23): ""o-ikat=oŋ Adam [muabari sun/clock(f) ‘Adam checked his watch’aŋ] 3fO-check=3mS A. 3m.PossII.s""

4. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Example (16): ""u-on\ma [i-tie mikana] 3mS-sit 3m-there man ‘the/that man sits/sat’""

5. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (24): ""[nǝmo o-u-uluan] [i-tie non kuraima] nirobu want 3fO-3mS-follow 3m-there ‘some’ bush.spirit(m) coconut.palm(f) ‘this bush spirit wanted to follow the coconut palm (up)’""

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Example (23): ""o-ikat=oŋ Adam [muabari sun/clock(f) ‘Adam checked his watch’aŋ] 3fO-check=3mS A. 3m.PossII.s""

From these examples, it is evident that the verb often precedes both the subject and the object. The structure of the sentences consistently shows the verb appearing first, followed by the subject and then the object. This pattern is indicative of a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order.

### Conclusion:
**VSO**",vso,vso
Imonda,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Imonda can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the verb must occur in the final position within a clause: ""there is only one constraint, namely the requirement for the verb to occur in final position."" This indicates that the verb (V) is always at the end of the clause.
2. The same paragraph also provides examples illustrating the flexibility in the order of the subject (S) and object (O) around the verb:
   - Example (54) shows the subject (SU) before the object (OB): ""ka pafeia suefe-i1"" (I am going to make a fire).
   - Example (55) shows the object (OB) before the subject (SU): ""ne-m ka lapi fe-f"" (I will shoot you).
   - Example (57) shows the object (OB) before the beneficiary (BEN) and subject (SU): ""6h-nki ne-m ka f - i a -na - t a -me"" (shall I get this one for you?).
   - Example (58) shows the adverb (ADV) before the subject (SU) and object (OB): ""hai f 6 ehe-fed-nki pinisim f e"" (she finished that again).
   - Example (59) shows the subject (SU) before the object (OB) and adverb (ADV): ""ka ne-m h a i f 6 ah-t6g6 eg - l a -m-6"" (why should I follow you again).

3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates the verb-final constraint, further supporting the SOV structure: ""The order of elements within the NP and the clause is fairly flexible... there is only one constraint, namely the requirement for the verb to occur in final position.""

4. **Paragraph 21** discusses the predicate structure and mentions that the subject and object are core NPs (noun phrases) that are syntactically handled specifically, reinforcing the importance of their order relative to the verb.

5. **Paragraph 35** provides examples of transitive verbs with subject and object, where the verb is always in the final position:
   - Example (44): ""gg&t -ianAi-rnpo-iaga-api-peha-l6h-f"" (the enemy lies thrown down in the water).
   - Example (45): ""pafeia kubui ed-iaga-keda-16h-f"" (a big stone was hanging down there).

From these observations, it is clear that while the order of the subject and object can vary, the verb consistently appears at the end of the clause. This indicates that the dominant word order in Imonda is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nimboran, there is no explicit information about the dominant word order (order of subject, object, and verb) in declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns. The paragraphs mainly discuss morphological aspects of the language, such as verb forms, inflectional categories, and phonological characteristics, but they do not provide clear examples or descriptions of the syntactic structure involving the order of subject, object, and verb.

**Reasoning:**
1. The paragraphs focus heavily on the morphology of verbs, including various inflectional categories and their forms.
2. There is detailed discussion on the formation of infinitives, final infinitives, and various verb categories (e.g., Future, Present, Past, Durative).
3. The text does not provide specific examples of declarative sentences with clear subject, object, and verb constituents that would allow for the determination of a dominant word order.

**Conclusion:** Not mentioned in the grammar.",not mentioned in the grammar,not mentioned in the grammar
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Abun can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** clearly states that the basic word order of an Abun clause is **SUBJECT VERB OBJECT (SVO)**. It mentions that subjects are marked by their preverbal position and objects by their postverbal position. This indicates a clear SVO structure.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates that the direct object in an Abun transitive clause is encoded by word order alone and always follows the verb, reinforcing the SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 3** supports this by stating that the subject is marked by word order as preverbal and the object as postverbal, again indicating an SVO structure.

4. **Paragraph 7** provides an example sentence ""Isak gwa 1PL"" which translates to ""Isak hit us men,"" following the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 12** mentions that Abun has a rigid word order of SVO, distinguishing it from the Papuan SOV word order.

6. **Paragraph 46** provides an example of a transitive clause with the structure SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT, further confirming the SVO order.

7. **Paragraph 47** gives another example where the structure is SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + DATIVE, maintaining the SVO order.

8. **Paragraph 48** describes intransitive clauses with the structure SUBJECT + VERB, which aligns with the SVO order in transitive clauses.

9. **Paragraph 50** discusses the analytical nature of Abun and mentions that word order alone defines core grammatical relations, supporting the SVO structure.

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Meryam Mir,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 3** states:
   - ""Its word order is basically A-O-V or S-V with the verb always in word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on pragmatic features.""

2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates:
   - ""It has an A-O-V or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology.""

3. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of sentence structures:
   - Example (5.7): ""koskiride u ikris- Ii"" translates to ""(married) female-A coconutO scrape-Prlmpf"" which follows the A-O-V order.
   - Example (5.9): ""able neys nar miwsriyey"" translates to ""Det two boatO 3n SgO-drag up on shore-PfDual"" which also follows the A-O-V order.
   - Example (5.10): ""ka uteb [lumi dikris- i]"" translates to ""lSgA placeO weed scrape-Pf"" which again follows the A-O-V order.

4. **Paragraph 6** also mentions:
   - ""Word order tends to be A-O-V or S-V with local arguments either following or preceding the nucleus.""

From these observations, it is clear that the dominant word order in Meryam Mir is A-O-V (which corresponds to SOV in terms of subject, object, and verb order).

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Hatam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hatam, the following observations can be made regarding the dominant word order:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that Hatam is a ""rather strict (S)OV language"" and that it is possible to have an OV order. This suggests that the language predominantly follows an SOV structure but allows for some flexibility.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph discusses the general clause formula and mentions that ""Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed."" However, it does not contradict the earlier statement about the SOV order being dominant.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph provides an example where the object is pre-posed, yielding an OV order. This supports the flexibility in object positioning but does not negate the dominant SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 11**:
   - This paragraph explicitly states, ""Hatam is a rather strict SVO language,"" which seems contradictory to the earlier statement about SOV. However, given the context and the examples provided, it appears that the dominant order might be SOV with some flexibility allowing for SVO structures in certain contexts.

5. **Other Paragraphs**:
   - The other paragraphs do not provide explicit information about the dominant word order but discuss various syntactic structures and flexibility in word order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, it seems that Hatam primarily follows an SOV word order with some flexibility allowing for SVO structures in certain contexts. The dominant word order, considering the majority of the evidence, is SOV.

**Conclusion: SOV**",svo,sov
Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Kwomtari grammar shows many features typical of Papuan languages or of the Sepik region. Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and constituent order is SOV.""
   - This paragraph explicitly states that the constituent order in Kwomtari is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS.""
   - This reinforces the information from Paragraph 1, confirming that Kwomtari follows an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The general order in the clause is SOV. Example (1) illustrates this basic clause order: (1) Klifu gwaie-le pie-fo-lee. dog cassowary-GL bay-3S.O-3S.R ‘The dog bayed at the cassowary.’""
   - This paragraph provides an example of the SOV order in a sentence, further confirming the dominant word order.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""Order within the verb phrase is relatively free, with the exception that the verb occurs last.""
   - This indicates that while there may be some flexibility within the verb phrase, the verb consistently appears at the end, aligning with an SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""A simple sentence contains one clause, which is marked on the verb for status realis or irrealis. The default status is realis, so this is the status assumed when the predicate is nonverbal. The clause functions as the sentence base, and is associated with a typical intonation. Examples (1) - (5) are examples of simple sentences: (1) Nariemu-le ite-i gria-le-lee. wife-GL house-LOC leave-do-3S.R ‘He left his wife at home.’""
   - This paragraph provides additional examples of sentences following the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 10**:
   - ""Complex sentences contain one or more dependent clauses, together with an independent clause. They are conjoined by the suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’, -i ‘SIM’ or a conjunction. The final, independent clause is the only one which may be marked either for realis or irrealis status. Preceding clauses are marked with default realis status, but in fact take their status from the final clause.""
   - While this paragraph discusses complex sentences, it does not contradict the SOV order established in simpler sentences.

7. **Paragraph 11**:
   - ""If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being preceded by glei. It appears that -i is used to give clarification as to how much of a sentence is being negated, since the scope of glei can extend over more than one verb. Note that when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i is evident.""
   - This paragraph focuses on negation but does not provide new information about the basic word order.

8. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""A simple sentence contains one clause, which is marked on the verb for status realis or irrealis. The default status is realis, so this is the status assumed when the predicate is nonverbal. The clause functions as the sentence base, and is associated with a typical intonation. Examples (1) - (5) are examples of simple sentences: (1) Nariemu-le ite-i gria-le-lee. wife-GL house-LOC leave-do-3S.R ‘He left his wife at home.’""
   - This paragraph reiterates the SOV structure with additional examples.

Inanwatan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can analyze the word order by examining the structure of the sentences given.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (4.9): ""Ni-a-weigo-re."" (I SG.S-2SG.O-deceive-PAST) - ""I deceived you.""
     - This sentence follows the SOV order.
   - Example (4.10): ""Aoutourame-rf-we-be."" (They gave us their fish)
     - This sentence follows the SVO order.
   - Example (4.11): ""Nf-taturi-dereni-tato-ereour-grandfather-and our-grandmother-andaq[romaqareforeleg hindleg mog6-we-rawe-re."" (My grandfather and grandmother carried up the foreleg and the hindleg)
     - This sentence follows the SOV order.
   - Example (4.12): ""Ag6-waie-ra-qame-rabu-ego-imeduro ewai."" (And he had hidden her wings)
     - This sentence follows the SVO order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (4.1): ""Ne-re-be."" (I SG.s-sleep-PRES) - ""I (just) slept.""
     - This is an intransitive sentence, so it does not provide information about the order of subject, object, and verb in a transitive clause.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Example (3.43): ""Ni-a-weigo-re."" (I SG.S-2SG.O-deceive-PAST) - ""I deceived you.""
     - This sentence follows the SOV order.
   - Example (3.44): ""Mi-ri-ra-rita +miroqai-weebe + nige-tabo-be."" (They say to us, it is true, we have heard the same thing about the girl)
     - This sentence follows the SVO order.
   - Example (3.45): ""Awogemeqaro naguare awoge dinasi-da-woagainhouseonenago-woagain service-poSS-be.3SG.F one-CONNbuat nanti paakai-beqewu ma re-re-sa."" (And they gave me also a house of the (health) service to live there in the future)
     - This sentence follows the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - This paragraph discusses verb morphology and does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - This paragraph discusses language death and ethnic identity and does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph discusses clause combinations and does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - This paragraph discusses noun compounds and does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - This paragraph discusses transcribing and analyzing speech in bilingual communities and does not provide specific examples of sentence structure.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example (4.36): ""Suqere m6go-we-wo-re."" (She brought sago)
     - This sentence follows the SVO order.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Example (1.15): ""O-n-indesor."" (2SG.S-1SG.O-yell) - ""You yelled to me.""
      - This sentence follows the SOV order.
    - Example (1.16): ""A-na-sib-et."" (3SG.M.S-1SG.O-hit-FUT) - ""He will hit me.""
      - This sentence follows the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided sentences, Inanwatan exhibits both SOV and SVO word orders. However, the presence of both orders without a clear dominance of one over the other suggests that Inanwatan does not have a single dominant word order. Therefore, the most accurate classification for Inanwatan is:

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Iau,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Verb Finality**:
   - Paragraph 1 (6.3.1 Verb Final) explicitly states that the verb with its associated particles always occurs clause-final. This is a strong indicator of a verb-final language, which typically aligns with SOV or OSV word orders.

2. **Noun Order by Topicality**:
   - Paragraph 1 (6.3.2 Nouns Ordered by Topicality) mentions that nouns are ordered by topicality rather than grammatical function. This means that both SOV and OSV orders are possible depending on the topicality of the nouns. However, the verb remains final in all cases.

3. **Examples of Clause Structures**:
   - Paragraph 1 provides examples where the subject and object can switch places based on topicality, but the verb remains at the end:
     - ""A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴."" (I book see-TOT.INC Nomin good) - SOV
     - ""Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ doe⁷ e⁸ da⁹ki⁶ y⁴."" (book I see-TOT.INC Nomin good) - OSV

4. **Clause Types and Sentence Structures**:
   - Paragraph 2 (6.5 Clauses, The Building Blocks Of Sentences) and Paragraph 3 (Grammatical Overview of Iau) further support the verb-final structure by showing various clause types and their combinations, all maintaining the verb-final position.

5. **Core Nouns and Clause Nucleus**:
   - Paragraph 10 (6.1.2.2 PRE-NUCLEAR CORE CONSITUENTS) provides examples where the nouns precede the verb, reinforcing the verb-final structure:
     - ""A⁹ av⁸be⁸ bui² i -7 se⁵."" (I quickly upstream go-TOT.INC intend) - SOV
     - ""A⁹ tv⁹ sa³."" (I sago eat) - SOV
     - ""Tv⁹ bv⁶ da⁹ y⁹."" (sago I eat up Stmnt) - OSV

6. **Pro-drop and Flexibility**:
   - Paragraph 5 (6.4 Pronoun Reference Within The Clause) indicates that Iau is a pro-drop language, which means that pronouns can be omitted, but this does not affect the verb-final structure.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Iau is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is based on the consistent verb-final structure observed in the examples and descriptions provided in the grammar. While there is flexibility in the order of nouns based on topicality, the verb consistently appears at the end of the clause, which is characteristic of SOV languages.",no dominant order,sov
Karkar-Yuri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karkar-Yuri, it is challenging to determine the dominant word order directly due to the fragmented and unclear nature of the text. However, there are some clues that can be pieced together to make an educated guess.

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions ""Subject, Object, Indirect"" which suggests a structure where the subject and object are clearly defined roles in sentences.
2. **Paragraph 10** discusses verb constructions and mentions ""non-finite"" and ""finite verbs,"" indicating that verbs play a significant role in sentence structure.
3. **Paragraph 18** provides an example: ""Neta'rap-o; child-s-9r.moos |-s0=apamoby S -sel-poSsd-postoherchild,heryounger'son!"" This example seems to place the subject ""child"" before the verb ""moos"" and the object ""her younger son"" after the verb, suggesting an SVO order.
4. **Paragraph 27** mentions ""SubjectTudirectplusPersonsingularSpecificSubjectVO,"" which could imply a subject-verb-object order.
5. **Paragraph 34** provides another example: ""Thetwoa'sfusevowelscometogetherinaconstructionssekerep-anteslip-dessvecfinitevbst+‘you foldesslip/falldfolacdown)'acspecHeadmay4+- Head,Mwiikorfi«porokwaparopKoropmonap-antegaramutathitmencomenotthey-desspec(we)thepangeddrua(but)themendidKoyuruytokwalarayopwar<-ovigmalebigthereangryyar-ansereboysdua- doSoy¥ Seth aethedigASaputIconsequenceofthetwowarnedtoiinepainfolman staboys""niita'raypstwale3notcone.mikyenlkurekapy~conseqinheldcomeeoutthereavolitionalQuotefollovs.....avolitional'aramanteangry,lestitseqvigheldintherebeingsaying,'t....-.ee!telestfolthepainincrease'come."" This example is more complex, but it seems to follow an SVO pattern as well.

Given these observations, the evidence leans towards an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order for Karkar-Yuri.

**Conclusion:** SVO",sov,svo
Yelî Dnye,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yelî Dnye, we can determine the dominant word order by examining the explicit statements and examples given about the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in declarative sentences.

1. **Paragraph 2:**
   - This paragraph explicitly states: ""The order of terms in the clause is SOV.""
   - It also provides further details about the grammatical structure, indicating a modified nominative-accusative system within the predicate but following ergative marking in the clause.

2. **Paragraph 1:**
   - This paragraph describes the predominant order of items in verbal clauses, listing the subject (±Subject) and object (±Object) before the predicate (+Predicate). This aligns with an SOV structure.

3. **Paragraph 3:**
   - This paragraph discusses the order of items within the clause, mentioning the presence of explicit subjects and objects and their typical positions. It supports the idea that subjects and objects are often made explicit in the clause, consistent with an SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 10:**
   - This paragraph mentions the agreement between the verbal prenucleus and the ergative item (subject) and the postnucleus with the absolutive item (object), reinforcing the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 11:**
   - This paragraph provides examples of the verb agreement with the subject and object, further supporting the SOV order.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Yelî Dnye is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).",sov,sov
Sentani,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, we can deduce the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Although the most unmarked word order is SOV, word order in Sentani is quite free...""
   - ""The verb itself cannot move. That is to say, in some cases the object is placed after the verb...""
   - Example: ""næko wəwnə"" (3.POSS-father ask-3SG.SBJ-3SG.OBJ) translates to 'The father said to his son.'

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Thus, the most standard word order is SOV.""
   - ""There is no dedicated case marking on the nominal arguments, meaning that the assignment of syntactic roles is based on context, pronominal case marking on the verb, and constituent ordering.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""For the subject and object constituents, the most typical movement is the fronting of the object constituent in order to focalize it.""
   - Example: ""ələkoke a.tejæ ware a"" (say-PLU-PST-IND PRO:1SG PRO:2SG=TWDS word) translates to 'I have said something to you.'

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved, depending on information structural processes.""

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Example: ""mækə nəkəwole"" (VENT-go-PST-IND sit-IMPF-IND) translates to 'Coming back, he returned back [from a woman] to a man.'

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Example: ""Onsá ninæ tare ərəjkobo"" (PN already PRO:1SG=TWDS see-E-PST-AU) translates to 'Onsá already saw me.'

7. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Example: ""Onsá naj mænggə"" (PN PRO:3.POSS girl) translates to 'Onsá has a daughter.'

8. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example: ""wa mbəra?"" (PRO:2SG where=FROM) translates to 'Where did you come from?'

### Conclusion:

The dominant word order in Sentani is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by multiple references in the grammar indicating that the most unmarked and standard word order is SOV, despite the language having a relatively free word order influenced by information structure.",sov,sov
Mpur,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.""
2. **Paragraph 11** supports this by mentioning that ""morphology and syntax show Austronesian features (Reesink 1998:603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order and the absence of heavy verb morphology.""

These two pieces of evidence clearly indicate that the dominant word order in Mpur is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Mehek,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides several examples and explanations indicating that both subject and object normally precede the verb. It mentions that sentences where both subject and object are nominal and the same in number and gender are unambiguous, with the first noun phrase being the subject and the second the object. This suggests an SOV order. Additionally, it notes that while the object can occasionally precede the subject, this is rare and typically occurs to avoid ambiguity, indicating that OSV is not the dominant order.

2. **Paragraph 6**: The general structure of clauses is given as ""subject + (mood particle) + (direct object) + (indirect object) + verb,"" which aligns with an SOV order.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph reiterates that the subject normally comes first when both subject and object occur before the verb, reinforcing the SOV order.

### Conclusion: SOV",sov,sov
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, we can analyze the word order in declarative sentences where both the subject (S) and object (O) are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Stokhof (1984) claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent fronting is mentioned.
2. **Paragraph 5**: Examples (1) and (2) show sentences where the verb occurs in the final position, and the arguments (subject and object) precede the verb. Specifically:
   - (1) ""ama sieng nee"" translates to ""someone eats rice/people eat rice"" (SOV order).
   - (2) ""fala fak-i"" translates to ""a house broke down"" (SOV order).
3. **Paragraph 4**: Features of Abui syntax include basic Actor-Undergoer-Verb (AUV) constituent order, which aligns with SOV.
4. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the distributional properties of nouns and verbs, indicating that verbs typically follow the arguments.
5. **Paragraph 15**: In noun phrases, modifiers follow the head noun, suggesting a tendency for head-final structures, which is consistent with SOV order.
6. **Paragraph 19**: The quantifier loku (PL) follows the head noun, reinforcing the head-final structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, the dominant word order in Abui is **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb).

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Arapesh (Abu):

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that the word order in Abu is ""subject-verb-object"" (SVO). It states that the ordering is obligatory and different from most Papuan languages, which typically have SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 by stating that Abu has a strict SVO grammatical word order, compensating for the absence of overt case marking morphemes.

3. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes the structure of sentences in Abu, mentioning that sentences consist of an actor-subject phrase argument (A) and a predicate, with the actor-subject phrase coming first, followed by the predicate. This supports the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 43**: This paragraph provides an example of a transitive clause in Abu: ""kw-a-ha nubat"" (She hit/killed a dog), which follows the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph provides an example of a simple sentence in Abu: ""aleman ubahi-n-e-r-i n-a-ha bul kani walub"" (The big man killed a pig at the river), which also follows the SVO order.

6. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph provides an example of a reflexive construction: ""anen-a-da-ha nn"" (He killed himself), which follows the SVO order.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the dominant word order in Arapesh (Abu) is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

### Conclusion:
SVO",svo,svo
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Korafe can be determined by examining the syntactic structure and the order of constituents in declarative sentences, particularly those involving both subject (S) and object (O) participants as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""Although SOy represents the unmarked order of core constituents in transitive verbal clauses, other configurations (i.e. 0 S V , S V , 0 v , v) also occur.""
   - This indicates that while other configurations are possible, SOV is the unmarked (default) order.

2. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""Information is structured in sentences by the order of arguments and by pragmatic markers. Although SOY is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause, OSY occurs when the object has pragmatic topic function and the subject pragmatic focus function.""
   - This reinforces that SOV is the default order, with OSV occurring under specific pragmatic conditions.

3. **Paragraph 16**:
   - ""The unmarked order of core constituents in the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.""
   - This clearly states that SOV is the unmarked order, although there is some flexibility in word order.

4. **Paragraph 33**:
   - ""As noted above, the initial argument in a clause usually has TOPIC function. Sometimes this argument coincides with the subject, because the unmarked order of constituents in Korafe verbal clauses is SOY.""
   - This further confirms that SOV is the unmarked order.

5. **Paragraph 47**:
   - ""The default assumption is that the speaker is depicting the events involved in the wreck of the canoe in iconic order. However, the lack of temporal specification allows for the encoding of events that totally overlap as well as events in sequence.""
   - This suggests that while there is flexibility, the default order is assumed to be SOV.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**

The dominant word order in Korafe is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), as indicated by multiple references to it being the unmarked or default order in the provided descriptive grammar paragraphs.",sov,sov
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Alamblak can be determined as follows:

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraph 12 explicitly states: ""The basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in ordering.""
   - Paragraph 32 reinforces this by mentioning: ""The basic word order of a Two-place Clause is SOV; however, it is flexible.""
   - Paragraph 42 also supports this by stating: ""Included there is a resumé of the general features of Alamblak, most of which are implied by its basic SOV word order.""
   - Paragraph 48 mentions that Alamblak exhibits general morpho-syntactic tendencies typically associated with SOV languages.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that the basic or dominant word order in Alamblak is SOV, despite some flexibility in ordering.

2. **Conclusion:** SOV",sov,sov
I'saka,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, we can deduce the dominant word order of the language. Here are the key points that lead to the conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 7** explicitly states:
   > ""The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOV, with Oblique participants (including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the verb...""

   This directly indicates that the dominant word order in declarative sentences is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

2. **Paragraph 2** mentions:
   > ""I'saka clauses and phrases exhibit a quite strict word order, though there are pragmatic alternatives for many constructions.""

   This suggests that while there may be some flexibility for pragmatic reasons, there is a predominant order that is adhered to, which aligns with the SOV order mentioned in Paragraph 7.

3. **Paragraph 9** discusses deviations from the word order:
   > ""Deviations from the word order presented here are rare, although preverbal constituents are occasionally found either at the end of the clause for emphasis, or in the pragmatically marked preverbal 'focus' position...""

   This reinforces that there is a standard word order (SOV) from which deviations are rare and pragmatically marked.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   > ""The word order in non-verbal predicates parallels that found in verbal predicates in terms of the functions of the elements of the clause. The predicative noun or adjective is found in the same final position, just as the verb is in verbal clauses, and the subject of the predicate is again in initial position.""

   This further supports the SOV structure by indicating that the subject is typically in the initial position and the verb (or predicative element) is in the final position.

5. **Paragraph 12** provides an example:
   > ""In the first sentence we can see an NP with both the noun and the adjective inside it. It occurs preverbally, as we would expect of a P.""
   > (253) [NP Anuo] k-ani-ung Ros.
   > pig.M big 3SG.M-give-3SG.NM.DAT Rose
   > 'He gave a big pig to Rose.'

   This example shows the object (NP Anuo) preceding the verb (k-ani-ung), consistent with an SOV order.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, several key points consistently indicate the dominant word order of the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that Urim is a ""very consistent and rigid SVO-language."" It mentions that the position of the subject is very fixed and cannot be moved after the verb in most clause types. The object can be fronted for thematic reasons, but this does not affect the basic SVO structure.

2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that word order in Urim is rigid, with subjects almost always occurring before the verb. Objects can be fronted, but this is rare and does not change the basic SVO order.

3. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of experience clauses with the structure NP + NP + V, which aligns with the SVO order.

4. **Paragraph 9** discusses semitransitive clauses, noting that they have two obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb, again supporting the SVO order.

5. **Paragraph 27** describes monotransitive clauses, emphasizing that the semantic role of the transitive subject is almost exclusively that of an agent, which is typically animate and occurs before the verb, while the object follows the verb.

6. **Paragraph 40** mentions that in existence clauses, the subject can occur after the verb, but this is an exception rather than the rule. The basic word order remains SVO.

7. **Paragraph 41** discusses left dislocated subjects and objects, which are marked by a co-referential pronoun within the sentence, indicating that the basic SVO order is maintained even when elements are dislocated for emphasis or topicalization.

8. **Paragraph 44** provides examples of introducing new participants and referents to discourse, showing that new items are often introduced in subject position before the verb, consistent with SVO order.

9. **Paragraph 45** discusses left dislocation and topic constructions, which are used to mark topics and emphasize new information, but the basic SVO structure is preserved.

10. **Paragraph 47** describes verb plus demonstrative adverb constructions, which further support the SVO order by showing that the subject and object positions are maintained even in more complex constructions.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Example (36) displays normal SOV order: a topicalised subject and a non-topic marked object followed by the verb phrase.
   - ""Neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can readily be altered for pragmatic reasons.""

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The verbal clause always has a verb phrase which is the nucleus of the verbal clause. Neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can readily be altered for pragmatic reasons.""

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - ""The most common order within Abau is SOV, but this order can easily be changed to OSV.""

4. **Paragraph 7**:
   - ""Normal order within Abau is SOV, but based on prominence choices a speaker can change this order.""

5. **Paragraph 12**:
   - ""Default ordering of arguments is Subject Object Verb (SOV). This ordering frequently varies for pragmatic reasons.""

6. **Paragraph 14**:
   - ""Neutral or frequently observed order within the clause places the subject before the object. The verb phrase occurs clause-finally.""

From these paragraphs, it is clear that the neutral or default word order in Abau is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Although there is flexibility in the word order for pragmatic reasons, the dominant order remains SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the dominant word order of subject, object, and verb in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - Chamorro is described as a predicate-first language. The dominant word order in neutral clauses is Predicate Subject Object Obliques.
   - Example: ""Ha po’lu ta’lu tåtti si nanå-hu i låta gi papa’ i hagun gålak."" (Predicate Subject Object Obliques)

2. **Paragraph 2**:

   - Example: ""Ha latchai i na’-ña i taotåo."" (Predicate Subject Object)

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The dominant word order of clauses with verb or adjective predicates is Predicate Subject Object Obliques.
   - Example: ""Ha apåpasi i lalåhi singku pesus si Carmen."" (Predicate Object Subject)

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Mian, the dominant word order in transitive clauses where both subject and object are nouns is consistently described as AOV (Agent-Object-Verb). Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 2: Argument order in transitive clauses**:
   - It states that when both subject and object are full noun phrases, the unmarked constituent order is AOV. This order is consistently observed in elicited examples.
   - Example (91) clearly shows the AOV order: ""naka=e unáng=o wa-têm’-Ø-e=be"" ('The man saw the woman').

2. **Paragraph 3: Introduction**:
   - It mentions that the unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses. The verb is almost always final in any clause.

3. **Paragraph 5: Argument order in ditransitive clauses**:
   - It describes the unmarked constituent order in ditransitive clauses as A R O V (Agent-Recipient-Object-Verb), which aligns with the AOV order in simpler transitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 6: An analytical issue in head-internal relative clauses**:
   - Examples (71) and (72) show head-internal relative clauses with regular clausal syntax, displaying SV in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses.

5. **Paragraph 8: Reflexivization**:
   - Example (78) shows a transitive clause with AOV order: ""naka=e aal=e gò’-n-e=be"" ('The man has cut the skin').

6. **Paragraph 9: Constituent order**:
   - It states that the unmarked order of overtly realized argument noun phrases is S/A followed by O, with the verb being clause-final.

7. **Paragraph 10: Content questions**:
   - Example (50) shows a content question with AOV order: ""wan-ta a-temê’-b-eb=e?"" ('Who are you looking at?').

8. **Paragraph 16: Ditransitives**:
   - Example (55) shows a ditransitive clause with AOV order: ""n naka=e éil=o om-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be"" ('I gave the sow to the man').

9. **Paragraph 23: Verbs**:
   - It mentions that Mian is an SOV language, with the verb almost always being the last word in a clause.

10. **Paragraph 31: Object**:
    - Example (213) shows a transitive clause with AOV order: ""no=i ya-l-êt-n-e=ta"" ('he killed and brought/carried the marsupials').

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the word order in Chácobo by examining the placement of subjects (S), objects (O), and verbs (V) in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that objects can occur in positions 2 and 7, and that the argument which is most topical is closer to the verb. It also states that Chácobo does not allow VPA constituent order at all.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of APV and PAV orders, indicating some flexibility in the placement of arguments relative to the verb.
3. **Paragraph 7** mentions that in auxiliary verb constructions, APV order is slightly more common, but PAV order also occurs.
4. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of AVP order and mentions that Chácobo also displays a VAP constituent order, although it is extremely rare.
5. **Paragraph 19** shows examples of fronted-VP constructions where the object precedes the verb (OV), but these constructions are marked by specific discourse contexts.
6. **Paragraph 20** discusses fronted-VP constructions where the subject can occur in positions 2, 7, and 16, and the object appears in a fronted position before the V̄-constituent.
7. **Paragraph 21** mentions that Chácobo allows both APV and PAV word orders.
8. **Paragraph 22** shows an example of PAV order and mentions that constituent order in relation to the P argument does not affect case assignment.
9. **Paragraph 30** discusses fronted-VP constructions where the object must occur directly to the left of the verb in position 2, indicating OV order in these contexts.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Chácobo exhibits a significant degree of flexibility in word order. Both APV and PAV orders are mentioned multiple times, and there are also instances of AVP and VAP orders, though the latter is rare. The presence of fronted-VP constructions further complicates the picture, as they involve OV order in specific discourse contexts.

Given the variability and the lack of a single dominant order that is more than twice as common as the others, it is reasonable to conclude that Chácobo does not have a dominant word order.

### Conclusion: 
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Hup can be determined by examining the frequency and context in which different word orders appear in declarative sentences involving both subject and object as nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that the basic order of nominal arguments in transitive clauses is difficult to ascertain definitively. However, it suggests that Hup speakers prefer AOV (SOV) constituent order when there are no other clues to the identity of subject and object.
   - Example (9a) shows ""snake jaguar kill"" (SOV).
   - Example (9b) shows ""jaguar kill snake"" (SOV).
   - Text counts suggest that AOV (SOV) order is at least twice as common as OAV order.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Constituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is verb-final.
   - The basic constituent order can arguably be identified as AOV (SOV).
   - The actual order of all constituents appears to be determined primarily by pragmatics, with new information being fronted.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The order of constituents in ditransitive clauses follows similar guidelines to that in transitive clauses.
   - When both objects are present, their order is governed mainly by pragmatics.
   - Non-pronominal subjects are more likely to be clause-initial, supporting the argument that basic constituent order is AOV (SOV).

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Verb-final constituent order is the norm when clauses encode events that are not currently in progress.
   - Intransitive and transitive clauses are frequently initiated by an adverbial word or clause, followed by the subject, and finally the verb.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - The functional and historical motivations for Verb-Subject constituent order variant in the declarative clause may be several.
   - Fronting the verb in relation to the subject places focus on the event itself.
   - However, verb-final constituent order is typical in Hup discourse.

6. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The order of constituents within the noun phrase is fairly rigid, but this does not directly affect the determination of SOV order in clauses.

7. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Constituent order in these examples is fairly free, but the least prototypically ‘core’ participant is clause-final, following the verb.

8. **Paragraph 8**:
   - While verb-final constituent order is basic in Hup, an alternative order, in which the verb precedes the subject in the declarative clause, is also in use.
   - This order is often favored when the clause encodes an ongoing or currently relevant event.

9. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Other features of Hup grammar include a basically verb-final constituent order; this is best characterized as AOV (SOV), although the relative order of A and O is highly flexible.

10. **Paragraph 10**:
    - Polar questions with focus on predicate have subject-final rather than verb-final constituent order.

11. **Paragraph 11**:
    - Pronominal subjects in Hup almost always immediately precede the verb in the clause, resulting in a default OAV order.

12. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Emphasis in polar questions can be signaled via the clause-final Focus marker.

13. **Paragraph 13**:
    - The relative order of subject and verb plays an important role in defining declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses.
    - The order of subject and object arguments in transitive clauses is highly flexible.

14. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Despite the fact that both subjects and some objects are unmarked and that constituent order is fairly free in Hup, ambiguity is easily avoided.

15. **Paragraph 15**:
    - The order of verb stems must iconically reflect the order of events.

16. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Not every post-predicative NP can easily be interpreted as external to the main clause.

17. **Paragraph 17**:
    - The defining characteristic of verb stems in Hup is their inability to appear ‘bare’—without affixes—as predicates of a clause.

18. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Constituent order is generally like that of the declarative clause, but is consistently verb-final.

19. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Despite the strong preference for subject pronouns to precede the verb, this is not absolutely obligatory.

20. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Subjects frequently appear post-verbally, and there often is little or no evidence that this is anything more than a variation in clause-internal constituent order.

21. **Paragraph 21**:
    - The order of combination of stems follows specific conventions based on their class membership.

22. **Paragraph 22**:
    - The order of pronominal objects relative to other nominal constituents also depends on pragmatics.

23. **Paragraph 23**:
    - This interrogative strategy is typically used in questions involving a focused constituent.

24. **Paragraph 24**:
    - Negating the assertion of the corresponding affirmative clause frequently does not require splitting up the compound.

25. **Paragraph 25**:
    - This prevalence of pronominal subjects, which appear to be marginally procliticized to the verb, may represent an early step towards the historical development of a system of pronominal clitics.

26. **Paragraph 26**:
    - The order of combination of stems follows specific conventions based on their class membership.

27. **Paragraph 27**:
    - Predicate adjective clauses—in which the adjectival predicate is unmarked with any inflection—are illustrated.

28. **Paragraph 28**:
    - The order of constituents within the noun phrase is fairly rigid.

29. **Paragraph 29**:
    - Noun compounding in Hup is a highly productive process.

30. **Paragraph 30**:
    - These ordering principles interact with the temporal succession principle discussed above to organize compounds that are made up of multiple stems.

31. **Paragraph 31**:
    - The relative order of formative types in the verb is Inner Suffix – Boundary Suffix = Enclitic Particle.

32. **Paragraph 32**:
    - Hup’s third strategy for creating a relative clause relies on nominalization via a case marker.

33. **Paragraph 33**:
    - The use of hup- can result in a standard reflexive reading, a passive, or a reciprocal, depending on the semantics of the verb and on the general context.

34. **Paragraph 34**:
    - These Hup compounds are much like the “iconic” serial verbs described by Durie.

35. **Paragraph 35**:
    - Hup makes productive use of verb compounding to create expressions of complex valency.

36. **Paragraph 36**:
    - The interrogative form hˆ‚-n’ˆh ‘what’ occurs in place of an adjective.

37. **Paragraph 37**:
    - Hup has only one marginal process that could perhaps be considered a form of verb serialization.

38. **Paragraph 38**:
    - As a single-predicate, cosubordinate construction, a compound verb in Hup must encode an event that has a degree of conceptual unity.

39. **Paragraph 39**:
    - The motivation for the stem order is less clear.

40. **Paragraph 40**:
    - Verb compounding is an areal feature in the Vaupés region.

41. **Paragraph 41**:
    - Many adverbials in Hup are adjectives that do ‘double duty’ as verbal modifiers.

42. **Paragraph 42**:
    - Wanting to eat fish, and being without a husband, just for this she was going upstream taking (the fish).

43. **Paragraph 43**:
    - The primary function of constituent or ‘question-word’ questions is to solicit specific information.

44. **Paragraph 44**:
    - Verbal art is quite rich among the Hupd’´h, and includes a variety of traditional stories and personal narratives.

45. **Paragraph 45**:
    - The function of -teg to express purpose is closely related to its use as a future marker.

46. **Paragraph 46**:
    - The different causative constructions are not usually interchangeable, but differ in important ways.

47. **Paragraph 47**:
    - Negative -nˆ¤h cannot co-occur with certain Boundary Suffixes.

48. **Paragraph 48**:
    - The order of combination of stems follows specific conventions based on their class membership.

49. **Paragraph 49**:
    - All nominal constituents of the main clause can be questioned, whether they are core or peripheral.

50. **Paragraph 50**:
    - The order of pronominal objects relative to other nominal constituents also depends on pragmatics.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Kwaza,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwaza, the following observations can be made regarding the dominant word order in declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions that in transitive sentences with an overt subject and object, the order is usually SVO or SOV, with no discovered difference in meaning between these orders.
   - Example (38) shows SVO: ""kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki zjwãu"" (canoe=leg-too kill-DEC João) - ""the car killed João"".
   - Example (39) shows SOV: ""kanwã=ekai-'e zjwãu o'tsi-ki"" (canoe=leg-too João kill-DEC) - ""the car killed João"".
   - The text also mentions that OSV is considered nonsense, indicating a preference for subject-initial orders when both subject and object precede the predicate.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (42) shows OVS: ""hita-'wã aure-da'mͿ-tse ho'Bİto"" (Rita-AO marry-want-DEC Roberto) - ""Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita"".
   - Example (43) shows SVO: ""kuraku'ra 'tsje-ki jere'xwa"" (chicken close-DEC jaguar) - ""jaguar grabbed chicken"".
   - Example (44) shows VSO: ""'tsje-ki jere'xwa ku'rakura-'wã"" (close-DEC jaguar chicken-AO) - ""jaguar grabbed chicken"".
   - Example (45) shows SOV: ""jere'xwa kuraku'ra-wã 'tsje-ki"" (close-DEC jaguar chicken-AO) - ""jaguar grabbed chicken"".
   - The text indicates that word order variability may depend on case marking and overt cross-reference agreement of subjects.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - The text states that constituent order in Kwaza is relatively free, although SVO and SOV patterns prevail.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - The text mentions that verbs are obligatorily marked for subject and mood, with overt pronominal or lexical arguments being optional.
   - This suggests that the language relies on verb morphology for grammatical relations, allowing for flexibility in word order.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that both SVO and SOV orders are frequently used in Kwaza, with no significant difference in meaning between them. Other orders like OVS and VSO are also attested but seem less common. Therefore, the dominant word order in Kwaza can be considered as having **No dominant order** due to the flexibility and variability in constituent arrangement.

### Conclusion: No dominant order",no dominant order,no dominant order
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The paragraph states that the basic constituent order in Wampis (Huambisa) is A P V (Agent, Patient, Verb), which corresponds to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) in terms of traditional grammatical relations. This is explicitly mentioned as the basic, pragmatically unmarked declarative clause order.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 by stating that the most frequent word order in transitive constructions is Subject-Object-Verb (APV), although other orders are permitted in certain pragmatic environments. This further supports the SOV order as the dominant one.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that the canonical order of major clause elements in Wampis is Subject-Object-Verb (APV/SV). This again aligns with the SOV order.

**Conclusion: SOV**",sov,sov
Cocama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can analyze the dominant word order in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the pragmatics of constituent order patterns and mentions that in non-progressive constructions, allowable patterns are (O)SV and SV(O), but the order *SOV is not allowed. In progressive-marked clauses, allowable patterns are S(O)V and (O)VS, but the order *OSV is not allowed.

2. **Paragraph 2**: States that subject and object are defined by their position with respect to the verb.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Tiriyo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the word order in Tiriyo. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions that Tiriyo could be described as a ""split-word-order"" language, indicating that the preferred word order is not the same in all clause types. This suggests variability in word order depending on the type of clause.

2. **Paragraph 8** discusses the general syntax of Cariban languages, including Tiriyo, and mentions that Tiriyo is a fairly typical Cariban language. It also references the OV (Object-Verb) verb phrase, which is common in Cariban languages.

3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of sentences with different word orders. It shows that in some cases, the word order is AOV (Agent-Object-Verb), as in the example ""AOVvpahkoji-pawanaetal:father 1-friend _hear:Prs.Prf"" meaning ""My father heard my friend.""

4. **Paragraph 20** discusses the pragmatically oriented word order in Tiriyo. It mentions that the unmarked position is different for different clause types. For example, habitual past clauses and remote past clauses tend to have an OVA (Object-Verb-Agent) order, while conjugated sentences do not follow this pattern.

5. **Paragraph 25** states that in simple sentences, the ordering of constituents is pragmatically determined, with topical elements tending to occur in initial position. This implies that word order can be flexible and context-dependent.

6. **Paragraph 32** describes remote past clauses, where the A participant occurs in a postpositional phrase, and the O and S participants occur as independent, non-case-marked noun phrases. This suggests an ergative-absolutive pattern in some contexts.

7. **Paragraph 36** provides examples of sentences with preverbal O noun phrases, indicating that the O noun phrase can occur before the verb, as in ""pahko_ta ~ pahko_taa_n-ai 1:father_Neg 1:father_Neg_3S,-Cop"" meaning ""It isn’t my father.""

8. **Paragraph 44** discusses non-verbal negation and provides examples where the O noun phrase precedes the verb, as in ""pahko_ta ~ pahko_taa_n-ai 1:father_Neg 1:father_Neg_3S,-Cop.""

9. **Paragraph 45** provides examples of verb forms with different grades, showing that the O noun phrase can occur before the verb, as in ""t-épéé-se ‘caught’.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Tiriyo exhibits variability in word order depending on the clause type and pragmatic context. However, there is a tendency for the Object to precede the Verb in many examples, suggesting an OV pattern. Given the variability and the presence of multiple word orders, it is most accurate to conclude that Tiriyo has **No dominant order**.

**Conclusion:** No dominant order",ovs,no dominant order

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Example (6.4) shows the order ""nokaeO fɨno-dɨ-oPRED"" (O V).
   - Example (6.5) shows the order ""nokae-naO fɨno-dɨ-oPRED"" (O V).
   - The text mentions a ""typical SV/AOV constituent order"" and emphasizes the importance of constituent order when morphological marking is absent.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The summary reiterates that Murui has a nominative-accusative pattern with ""S, A followed by O, occur before the V.""
   - It mentions that the constituent order allows certain flexibility but still emphasizes the S/AOV order.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples (6.168) and (6.169) show the order ""ɨmeO roko-d-ePRED FlorA"" (O V A) and ""nokaeO fɨno-d-ePRED [kue uzu-ma]A"" (O V A).
   - The text mentions that the typical order is ""SV (SXV) and AOV (AOXV)"" but allows for some flexibility, including occasional OVA order.

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (12.12) shows the order ""kueA [bai-e gui-ye]O:GIFT i-t-ePRED gato-moO:RECIPIENT"" (A O V O).
   - The text mentions that the constituent order in transitive clauses follows the overall AOV tendency.

Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, the dominant word order in Iquito can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the basic word order in Iquito, emphasizing that the most common word order is SVO. It mentions that although Iquito allows more than one possible word order, SVO is the least marked and most frequent, making it the basic word order.
   
2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reinforces that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO, particularly in independent transitive clauses with affirmative, realis mood, and active voice. It also notes that the alignment system based on word order exhibits an accusative pattern, further supporting SVO as the basic word order.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph states that SVO is the basic word order and is used in finite realis clauses. It contrasts this with the SXV word order used in irrealis mood, indicating that SVO is the default word order in realis contexts.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions that SVO word order appears very frequently in texts and is usually the word order that starts a discourse, supporting the idea that SVO is the dominant word order.

5. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO, which appears in all finite clauses with realis mood. It contrasts this with the SXV word order used in irrealis mood.

6. **Paragraph 32**: This paragraph provides examples of SVO word order in various contexts, including affirmative declaratives, past and present negative declaratives, and interrogatives, further supporting SVO as the dominant word order.

7. **Paragraph 46**: This paragraph discusses the position of the negative particle in relation to mood, noting that in realis mood, the word order is SVX, which aligns with the SVO pattern.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that while Iquito allows for multiple word orders, the SVO order is the most frequent and least marked, especially in realis mood contexts. This consistent emphasis on SVO as the basic and most common word order in various contexts supports the conclusion that SVO is the dominant word order in Iquito.

### Conclusion:
**SVO**",svo,svo
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can derive several key points about the word order in Movima:

1. **Hierarchical Alignment System**:
   - Movima uses a hierarchical alignment system where the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded as the first core argument (ARG1), and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the second core argument (ARG2). This suggests that the word order is influenced by semantic roles rather than strict syntactic positions (Paragraph 1).

2. **Fixed Word Order**:
   - The word order in Movima is described as fixed but semantically determined. This indicates that while the order of constituents is not entirely free, it follows a specific pattern based on the animacy hierarchy (Paragraph 1).

3. **Examples of Word Order**:
   - Several examples illustrate the structure of sentences in Movima:
     - Example (113) shows a sequence of verbs with incorporated arguments, where the subject (second person) is encoded as ARGintr (intransitive argument), and the objects (pumpkin, melon, beans) are incorporated into the verb.
     - Example (114) shows a left-dislocated NP (plantains) followed by a verb with an incorporated argument.
     - Example (115) shows a predicate nominal followed by a verb with an incorporated argument (guavas).

4. **Oblique Arguments**:
   - Oblique arguments are marked with a prefix and can encode various roles such as goal, source, temporal adjunct, and purpose (Paragraph 6). This suggests that the primary arguments (subject and object) are not marked obliquely, reinforcing the fixed order of core arguments.

5. **Transitive and Intransitive Clauses**:
   - The distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses is clear, with transitive clauses having two core arguments (subject and object) and intransitive clauses having one core argument (subject) (Paragraph 6).

6. **Examples of Transitive Clauses**:
   - Example (103) shows a transitive clause with the verb ""give"" where the agent and recipient are core arguments, and the theme is marked as oblique.
   - Example (104) shows a transitive clause with the verb ""show"" where the agent and recipient are core arguments, and the theme is marked as oblique.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, the dominant word order in Movima appears to be **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**. The subject (ARG1) typically precedes the verb, and the object (ARG2) follows the verb, consistent with the fixed but semantically determined word order described.

**Conclusion: SVO**",no dominant order,svo
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the structure of sentences and the positioning of subjects, objects, and verbs.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that both Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) are common word orders in Bora. This indicates a flexible word order but suggests a preference for OV structures.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Example (209) shows a basic clause where the subject precedes the predicate: ""o:?i:piè teï:né-?i"" (The dog runs), which is S-V.
   - Example (210) also shows a subject preceding the verb: ""a:nm $hèmé-?i"" (This one is sick), which is S-V.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Example (627) shows a subject preceding the verb: ""a^iéhm-:pè $i:paha-thé-?i"" (A/The chief went to hunt), which is S-V.
   - Example (628) shows a subject preceding the verb: ""mitjha-nè miammnaa teha:-?i"" (Many people come), which is S-V.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Example (846) shows a verb followed by a subject: ""maxtfhó-thm-:pè"" (He has not eaten), which is V-S.
   - Example (847) shows a verb followed by a subject: ""tó:-thm-:pè"" (He has not eaten meat), which is V-S.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Example (625a) shows a subject followed by an object and verb: ""Oke ihjyunuube"" (I-objAn mouth-do-(SgM)), which is S-O-V.
   - Example (625b) shows a subject followed by an object and verb: ""Óhditu ihjyu vaabe"" (I-anim-sou mouth-do-(SgM)), which is S-O-V.

6. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Example (525) shows a subject followed by an object and verb: ""ó axtjhmmi-? ti-:piè-khè"" (I see-(t) that-(SgM)-objAn), which is S-O-V.
   - Example (526) shows a subject followed by an object and verb: ""ó axtjhmmi-? amm-?phi-khè"" (I see-(t) you-DuF-objAn), which is S-O-V.

7. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Example (949) shows a subject followed by a verb: ""i?tatehó(?) [ti-ip’è phe:]-nè:"" (It is sad that he goes), which is S-V.

8. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example (229) shows a subject followed by an object and verb: ""a^iéhm-:pè i ?axkhi-mm-khè né:-?(i) ti-tjhè"" (chief-(SgM) self folk-plAn-objAn say-(t) that-(AnPl)), which is S-O-V.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Bora appears to be **SOV**. This conclusion is drawn from the frequent occurrence of sentences where the subject precedes the object and the verb, despite the flexibility and occasional use of other orders.

**Conclusion: SOV**",no dominant order,sov
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: States that the most frequent constituent word order is VOS. It also mentions that although the preferred constituent order is object followed by subject, the subject occasionally precedes the object in sentences where both constituents are overtly expressed.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that the basic order of constituents in a transitive/intransitive clause is verb, object, subject (VOS). It also notes that order may vary, but the basic order seems to be VOS.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Confirms that the constituent order is the same for nonfinite clauses as that for finite clauses, which is VOS.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Reiterates that the basic order seems to be VOS and provides an example (201a).

5. **Paragraph 5**: Notes that when third person NP objects are overtly expressed in sentences with certain verbs, a deviation from the normal VOS pattern usually occurs, but this deviation is noted as an exception rather than the norm.

6. **Paragraph 19**: States that the pragmatically unmarked constituent order in Wari' is VOS. It also describes configurations in which VOS can appear, reinforcing that VOS is the dominant order.

### Conclusion:
**VOS**",vos,vos

From Paragraph 29, we can infer that the structure follows a pattern where the subject precedes the object and the verb, suggesting an SOV order. This is supported by the example: ""Sefiora Maria is going to visit her grandmother's house,"" which can be interpreted as [Subject: Sefiora Maria] [Object: her grandmother's house] [Verb: is going to visit].

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can deduce the following about the word order in Trumai:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic or unmarked word orders for declarative clauses with verbal predicates are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. This suggests that the dominant word order in Trumai is SOV for transitive clauses.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that the Object (O) is preverbal, which aligns with the SOV order mentioned in Paragraph 3.

3. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences where the Object (O) occurs preverbally, and the Subject (A) comes before the verb phrase (VP), further supporting the SOV order.

4. **Paragraph 36**: It states that both S and O have to come right before the verb when they are lexically realized, reinforcing the SOV structure.

5. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph summarizes the basic word order for different clause types, including transitive clauses, which follow the [A [O V]] pattern, consistent with SOV.

6. **Paragraph 49**: This paragraph discusses the verb phrase structure and mentions that the absolutive NP (which can be S or O) is immediately preverbal, aligning with the SOV order.

From these observations, it is clear that the dominant word order in Trumai for declarative sentences with both subject and object participants as nouns is SOV.

Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, the dominant word order can be inferred as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that the order of predicates and their arguments in Yuracare is fairly flexible, making it difficult to come up with a basic word order. However, it notes a clear preference for postverbal subjects (VS order) in pragmatically neutral contexts, while preverbal subjects are often emphatic topics.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reinforces the idea that VS is the pragmatically neutral order, with preposed subjects being marked for emphasis. It also states that question words are always sentence-initial, regardless of their role, indicating a marked position for questions. For objects, there is no clear preference for pre- or postverbal positions in terms of frequency.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the difficulty in determining word order for non-verbal predicates and mentions that transitive verbs show a slight preference for postverbal subjects (55.8% of A arguments are postverbal).

4. **Paragraph 4**: It provides statistical data showing that objects occur on both sides of the verb with about equal frequency, and subjects are more frequently postverbal.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the ordering of applicative prefixes and cross-referencing prefixes, which is relevant for understanding the flexibility and complexity of verb morphology but does not directly address the dominant word order.

6. **Paragraph 6**: It mentions that complex clauses often have the verb in initial or second position, with various elements preceding the verb, indicating a tendency towards V-initial structures.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the flexibility of adjectives and possessors within noun phrases, which is not directly relevant to determining the dominant word order of clauses.

8. **Paragraph 8**: It discusses the use of prefixes and suffixes in Yuracare, which is more about morphological structure than syntactic word order.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses number marking and the flexibility of noun phrases, which again is more about morphology than clause-level word order.

10. **Paragraph 10**: It discusses clitics and their attachment to different hosts, which is relevant for understanding the syntactic structure but not directly about the dominant word order.

11. **Paragraph 11**: It reiterates that word order is relatively free, with overtly expressed subjects most frequently appearing in postverbal position and objects occurring on both sides of the verb with about equal frequency.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses phonological processes, which are not directly relevant to determining word order.

13. **Paragraph 13**: It discusses the structure of noun phrases, which is not directly relevant to clause-level word order.

Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 2** explicitly state that the normal word order in Kuna is subject, object, predicate (SOV). Examples provided in these paragraphs reinforce this structure:
   - ""An ogob kumpi."" (I coconut eat-want-to) translates to ""I want to eat coconut.""
   - ""Omedin we mol pakcha."" (The woman bought that blouse.)

2. **Paragraph 6** provides additional examples that follow the SOV structure:
   - ""Machi ua kucha."" (The boy ate the fish.)
   - ""Tad ua chwas."" (The elder caught fish.)
   - ""Pun mol enukcha."" (The girl washed the clothes.)
   - ""Mu mol makne."" (The old lady is going to sew a blouse.)
   - ""Ome mas tus."" (The woman cooked food.)

3. **Paragraph 26** further supports the SOV structure by describing the placement of indirect objects and their suffixes, which occur after the subject and before the direct object and verb in transitive sentences:
   - ""An pega mol ukcha."" (I gave the blouse to you.)
   - ""An machiga chogzha."" (I said (it) to the boy.)

4. **Paragraph 7** mentions that the normal word order for intransitive sentences is subject, then predicate, which aligns with the SOV structure for transitive sentences:
   - ""An abarmane."" (I run-going-to) translates to ""I am going to run.""

5. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 18** provide examples of causative constructions and purpose clauses that maintain the SOV order:
   - ""Pe neg chobgal machi imako."" (You make the boy build the house.)
   - ""An akan amine, tad ul chobgal."" (I am going to look for an axe in order for grandfather to make a canoe.)

6. **Paragraph 46** discusses the use of postpredicate position for emphasis or clarification, but this does not alter the basic SOV structure of the main clause.

### Conclusion:
**SOV**",sov,sov
Uru,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, the dominant word order can be determined as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that the principal word order is SOV. Example (38) supports this by showing the structure ""woman want-lSG-DEC"" which translates to ""I want a woman,"" indicating the SOV order.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that the most common types found in declarative clauses are SOV, SV, or OV. This supports the idea that SOV is a dominant order, even though SV and OV are also mentioned.

3. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph indicates that the unmarked declarative word order in principle is SOV, although other orders like SV or OV can also occur. This reinforces the idea that SOV is the dominant order.

4. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that among more elaborate imperative clauses, the word orders SOV and OSV are the most common, with SOV being one of them.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides an example ""I finish the house"" which follows the SOV order.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph mentions that word order is OV in all but one case of noun incorporation, which supports the SOV structure.

7. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph states that Uchumataqu is in principle SOV, although nearly every word order is possible, indicating flexibility but with a preference for SOV.

8. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph explicitly states that the basic word order in declarative clauses is SOV.

### Conclusion: SOV

The dominant word order in Uru is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This conclusion is supported by multiple references to SOV as the principal or basic word order in declarative clauses, even though the language exhibits some flexibility in word order.",sov,sov
Camsá,"### Reasoning for Dominant Word Order in Camsá

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of transitive clauses where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - ""Constituent order is relatively free in Andean languages, although there seems to be a preference for the order in which subject/actor and object precede the verb (SOV)” (Adelaar 2008:26).
   - ""This holds true for Kamsá: it has very free word order. The language seems to be SOV but because the word order is so free, and perhaps because of the influence of Spanish, it is not clear yet what should be considered its basic word order, if anything.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - ""The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremely flexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish.""

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Examples of transitive clauses:
     - (4a) ""ch bobonts tojashwa shlobts̈"" (SVO)
     - (4b) ""mënte kachës ch bobonts tonjwaliya librësha"" (SVO)
     - (4c) ""ch bobonts shlobts̈ tojashwa"" (SOV)
     - (4d) ""Carmen kanÿe mashakbe tonjobuayán"" (SOV)
   - ""Transitive clauses have very free word order, so much so that some have asserted that Kamsá has no dominant word order (Fabre 2001). In his typological sketch of Kamsá, Fabre says that out of one hundred instances he found a slight predominance of VERB + PATIENT (56%). Most AGENT NPs appear first, but the inverse order is not rare either (Fabre 2001).""

4. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Examples of sentences with various word orders, including SVO and SOV.

5. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""The language has very free word order, and it is not clear yet what should be considered its basic word order, if anything.""

### Conclusion

Based on the information provided, it is evident that Kamsá exhibits a very flexible word order with both SOV and SVO structures being common. The descriptive grammar indicates that while there is a slight preference for SOV, the influence of Spanish and the inherent flexibility of the language make it difficult to definitively classify a single dominant word order. Therefore, the most accurate classification for Kamsá, considering the provided data, is:

**Conclusion: No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, the dominant word order can be determined by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and the object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the basic OSV order in Warao and provides multiple examples illustrating this order. For instance:
   - ""ma saba tamaha rieko ribu-a-e"" translates to ""Diego said this to me,"" where ""Diego"" (subject) comes after ""this"" (object) and before the verb ""said.""
   - ""erike hube abu-a-e"" translates to ""A snake bit Henry,"" where ""snake"" (object) precedes ""Henry"" (subject) and the verb ""bit.""

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph reinforces the OSV order by discussing how comparatives and other complex constructions maintain this order. For example:
   - ""waniku simo naha ebo-kore ehobo-na-te"" translates to ""The moon shows up reddish when rain falls,"" where ""moon"" (subject) follows ""rain"" (object) and the verb ""shows up.""

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides a detailed analysis of the order of constituents in the basic simplex sentence, confirming the OSV order. Examples include:
   - ""ma saba tamaha rieko ribu-a-e"" (Diego said this to me) and ""erike hube abu-a-e"" (A snake bit Henry), both following the OSV structure.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of the verb-final structure in Warao, further supporting the OSV order. Examples include:
   - ""tama-ha a namu ma aisia nona-i-ha"" translates to ""The container of this one was made by me,"" where ""container"" (object) precedes ""this one"" (subject) and the verb ""made.""

5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the use of interrogative pronouns and their placement in sentences, which indirectly supports the OSV order by showing how questions are formed without altering the basic declarative structure.

6. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph provides additional examples of the OSV order in various sentence types, including negative and complex sentences.

### Conclusion:
**OSV**

The dominant word order in Warao is OSV (Object-Subject-Verb), as consistently illustrated by the examples and explanations provided in the descriptive grammar.",osv,osv
Cuiba,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the information relevant to determining the dominant word order in Cuiba is somewhat sparse and fragmented. However, there are a few key points that can be extracted:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the order of tagmemes (constituents) is generally free, with some exceptions. This suggests a degree of flexibility in word order.
   
2. **Paragraph 2** does not provide direct information about word order but indicates that subjects and objects are not marked, which might imply that word order could play a role in distinguishing these roles.

3. **Paragraph 4** lists various clitics related to verbs, subjects, and objects but does not specify their order in a sentence.

4. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of phrases and word formations but does not give clear examples of full sentences with subjects, verbs, and objects.

5. **Paragraph 9** describes discourse and response patterns but does not provide clear examples of declarative sentences with both subject and object nouns.

6. **Paragraph 15** gives examples of noun compounds and adjective-noun constructions but does not provide clear examples of full sentences with subjects, verbs, and objects.

7. **Paragraph 33** provides background information on the Cuiva language and its speakers but does not address word order directly.

The most relevant information comes from **Paragraph 1**, which suggests that the order of constituents is generally free, with some specific constraints. This implies that Cuiba does not have a rigid word order and may use different orders depending on context or emphasis.

### Conclusion:

Apurinã,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can analyze the dominant word order by examining the frequency and acceptability of different word order patterns in the language. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: 
   - It mentions that OSV cannot be considered a syntactically structured order and suggests that constituent order patterns are motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors.
   - It lists five transitive and two intransitive general clausal constituent order types: OSV, SOV, SVO, OVS, and VSO.
   - A text frequency count based on 8 texts shows that clauses with both NP-subject and NP-object co-occurring are only 8.6% of all clauses.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Provides examples of different word orders: SOV, OSV, SVO, OVS, VOS, and mentions that VSO is not acceptable.
   - States that except for VSO, all clausal constituent order patterns are acceptable in the language.

**Conclusion: SVO**",svo,svo
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the dominant word order in Kadiwéu can be determined by examining the frequency and flexibility of different word orders in declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph indicates that the constituent order in Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, but also mentions that possible orders include OVS, VOS, SOV, OSV, VSO, and SVO. It suggests that the high frequency of SVO order observed by Griffiths might be biased due to elicitation techniques, implying that SVO might not be as dominant as initially thought.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph reiterates that Kadiwéu has nonconfigurational properties, with free ordering of nominal phrases and mentions that the constituent order of main clauses can be OVS, VOS, SOV, OSV, SVO, and VSO.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph notes that OSV and OVS orders are avoided in isolated sentences to prevent ambiguity, but they are used when the context clarifies the roles of subject and object.

4. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph supports the use of OSV and OVS orders in contexts where the subject and object are clear.

5. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph confirms that Kadiwéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language, with nominal phrases being freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb.

6. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph discusses the free constituent order in declarative clauses, reinforcing the idea that nominal phrases can appear in any order.

7. **Paragraph 30**: This paragraph provides additional support for the nonconfigurational nature of Kadiwéu, emphasizing the free order of nominal phrases.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that Kadiwéu exhibits a high degree of flexibility in word order, allowing multiple configurations of subject, object, and verb. The language does not consistently favor one specific order over others in a way that would allow us to identify a single dominant word order. Instead, the free ordering of constituents suggests that Kadiwéu lacks a dominant word order.

### Conclusion:
**No dominant order**",no dominant order,no dominant order
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the dominant word order in Karajá by examining the structure of declarative sentences where both the subject and object are nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: 
   - ""However, when both subject and object are nouns, they can only be distinguished by the word order, canonically SOV.""
   - This explicitly states that the canonical word order in Karajá is SOV.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - ""Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the verb...""
   - This reinforces the SOV word order by stating that Karajá is an SOV language.

3. **Paragraph 17**:
   - ""Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language.""
   - This again confirms that the dominant word order is SOV.

4. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Example: ""dIkar´) waha ka-r-I-rakOèk´re"" translates to ""I will wait for my father.""
   - Here, ""dIkar´)"" (I) is the subject, ""waha"" (my father) is the object, and ""ka-r-I-rakOèk´re"" (will wait) is the verb, following the SOV order.

5. **Paragraph 39**:
   - Example: ""Î´kI k´ÎUra ∅-r-I-rOèr-a"" translates to ""He’s eaten (the) fish.""
   - Here, ""Î´kI"" (he) is the subject, ""k´ÎUra"" (fish) is the object, and ""∅-r-I-rOèr-a"" (eaten) is the verb, following the SOV order.

These examples and explicit statements from the grammar confirm that the dominant word order in Karajá is SOV.

### Conclusion:
SOV",sov,sov
