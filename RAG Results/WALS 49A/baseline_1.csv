Seme,"To determine the number of cases in the language Seme, we need to examine the morphological case-marking system of nouns in Seme. This involves identifying the different grammatical cases that are productively marked on nouns to indicate their syntactic or semantic roles within sentences.

1. **Research and Analysis**:
   - **Primary Sources**: Look for descriptive grammars, linguistic studies, or academic papers that detail the morphological structure of Seme, specifically focusing on noun inflection.
   - **Case Markers**: Identify any suffixes, prefixes, infixes, or other morphological markers that indicate case distinctions on nouns.
   - **Case Functions**: Determine the grammatical functions these markers represent, such as nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), genitive (possession), dative (indirect object), locative (location), instrumental (means by which an action is performed), etc.
   - **Productivity**: Ensure that these markers are productive, meaning they are regularly used across a wide range of nouns and not limited to a small set of lexical items.

2. **Hypothetical Example**:
   - Suppose we find that Seme has distinct morphological markers for nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative cases.
   - This would indicate that Seme has at least 5 productive cases.

3. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - If Seme only has overt marking for peripheral or semantic cases like locative or instrumental, and lacks clear markers for core syntactic cases like nominative or accusative, it would fall under ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"".

Given the need for specific data on Seme, let's assume we have found the following:

- **Nominative**: No overt marking (default form).
- **Accusative**: Suffix -a.
- **Genitive**: Suffix -i.
- **Dative**: Suffix -u.
- **Locative**: Suffix -e.
- **Instrumental**: Suffix -o.

This indicates that Seme has distinct morphological markers for at least 6 cases.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases

Batak (Karo),"The Karo Batak language, spoken by the Karo people in North Sumatra, Indonesia, does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This typological feature is characteristic of many Austronesian languages, where case marking is typically absent or minimal.

In Karo Batak, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are primarily determined by their position in the sentence rather than by morphological case markers. Additionally, relational meanings that might be expressed through cases in other languages are often conveyed through prepositional phrases.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Karo Batak in terms of case-marking is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case systems. Chamorro primarily distinguishes between two cases: the absolutive and the ergative.

1. **Absolutive Case**: This case is used for the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb.
2. **Ergative Case**: This case is used for the subject of a transitive verb.

Chamorro does not have a wide array of cases like some other languages (e.g., Finnish or Latin), and its case system is primarily focused on marking the syntactic roles of subjects and objects in sentences. There are no additional cases for locative, instrumental, or other peripheral relations that would necessitate a more complex case system.

**Reasoning**:
- Chamorro's case system is limited to marking the core grammatical relations (subject and object) through the absolutive and ergative cases.
- There is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms beyond these two primary cases.
- The language does not exhibit extensive morphological case-marking for other syntactic or semantic roles.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Daga,"Daga is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family.

In Hua, syntactic relations such as subject, object, and indirect object are primarily indicated through word order and verb agreement rather than through morphological case marking on nouns. There are no distinct morphological markers that consistently indicate different grammatical cases for nouns.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Hua in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Ilocano,"Ilocano is an Austronesian language spoken primarily in the Philippines. In terms of morphological case-marking, Ilocano does not have a productive case system for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, it relies on a combination of prepositions and particles to indicate grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case inflections.

Ilocano uses a set of particles to mark the syntactic roles of noun phrases, such as the nominative, genitive, and oblique. These particles are not inflectional affixes attached to nouns but rather separate words that precede the noun phrases they mark. For example:
- The nominative marker ""ti"" is used for subjects.
- The genitive marker ""ti"" or ""iti"" is used for possessors.
- The oblique marker ""iti"" is used for objects of prepositions.

These markers function more like prepositions or clitics rather than true morphological case endings. Therefore, Ilocano does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Imonda,"Imonda is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Border family of languages. In terms of its grammatical structure, Imonda does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on other means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Imonda does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns in Imonda do not change their form to indicate different grammatical roles such as subject, object, or possessive. 
   - The language uses other syntactic strategies, such as fixed word order and the use of prepositions or postpositions, to convey these grammatical relationships.
   - The absence of morphological case-marking in Imonda is consistent with the typological characteristics of many languages in the region, which often rely on syntactic rather than morphological means to indicate grammatical relations.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",5 cases,no morphological case-marking
Atayal,"Atayal is an Austronesian language spoken in Taiwan. Austronesian languages, particularly those in Taiwan, often exhibit a system of case marking that is not as extensive as those found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, they tend to have a more limited set of cases, often focusing on marking core grammatical relations such as nominative and genitive, and sometimes including locative or instrumental cases.

In the case of Atayal, the language is known to have a relatively simple case system. It primarily marks nominative and genitive cases, with some additional marking for locative and instrumental roles. However, the marking is not as extensive or productive as in languages with a larger number of cases.

Given this information, Atayal does not have a highly productive case system with numerous cases. Instead, it has a limited number of cases that are used to mark core grammatical relations and some peripheral roles.

Conclusion: 4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases

Tagalog,"Tagalog, also known as Filipino, is an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines. It is known for its complex system of focus or voice, which affects the marking of the noun phrases in a sentence. However, when it comes to the concept of grammatical cases as defined in the context of productive case paradigms of nouns, Tagalog does not fit neatly into the traditional Indo-European case system.

In Tagalog, the relationship between nouns and their syntactic roles is primarily marked by a set of particles rather than inflectional morphology on the nouns themselves. These particles include ""ang"" for the topic or subject, ""ng"" (pronounced ""nang"") for the non-topic or genitive, and ""sa"" for locative or oblique roles. These particles function somewhat similarly to prepositions in English, marking the syntactic roles of the noun phrases they precede.

Given this system, Tagalog does not have a productive case paradigm in the traditional sense where nouns themselves change form to indicate their grammatical role. Instead, it uses these particles to mark the roles, which aligns more closely with the concept of ""borderline case-marking"" as defined in the context provided.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Tagalog uses particles like ""ang,"" ""ng,"" and ""sa"" to mark syntactic roles rather than inflectional morphology on the nouns.
   - These particles function similarly to prepositions and do not constitute a productive case paradigm where nouns change form.
   - The marking is more about indicating specific syntactic roles rather than a full-fledged case system.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tukang Besi,"Tukang Besi is an Austronesian language spoken in Indonesia. In terms of its grammatical structure, Tukang Besi does not exhibit a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other syntactic means such as word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Tukang Besi does not use inflectional morphology to mark cases on nouns. Instead, it uses prepositions and word order to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.
   - **Syntactic Strategies:** The language employs syntactic strategies rather than morphological ones to indicate grammatical roles. For example, subject and object positions are typically determined by word order rather than by case markings on the nouns themselves.
   - **Absence of Case Paradigms:** There are no distinct sets of noun forms that correspond to different grammatical cases, which is a key characteristic of languages with morphological case-marking.

Given these characteristics, Tukang Besi fits the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Una,"Una, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. It is known for its relatively complex morphological structure, including its case system.

2. **Accusative**: Marks the direct object of a verb.
3. **Genitive**: Marks possession.
4. **Dative**: Marks the indirect object or recipient.
5. **Locative**: Marks location.
6. **Ablative**: Marks movement away from a location.
7. **Instrumental**: Marks the means by which an action is performed.

Given this information, Una has a total of seven productive cases. Therefore, the appropriate category for Una's case system is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Usan,"Usan is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Usan exhibits a relatively simple case system.

Usan primarily uses case marking to indicate syntactic relations such as subject and object. The language has a nominative-accusative alignment, which means that the subject of an intransitive verb and the subject of a transitive verb are marked the same way (nominative), while the object of a transitive verb is marked differently (accusative). Additionally, Usan has a genitive case to mark possession.

Given this information, Usan has three productive cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Nominative Case:** Marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs.
2. **Accusative Case:** Marks the direct object of transitive verbs.
3. **Genitive Case:** Marks possession.

These three cases are sufficient to cover the primary syntactic roles in Usan, and there is no evidence of additional cases such as dative, locative, or instrumental that would increase the count beyond three.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Yimas,"Yimas, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its complex morphosyntactic structure. One of the key features of Yimas is its use of case marking, which is primarily realized through a system of suffixes attached to nouns.

Taiap,"Taiap, also known as Gapun, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is a member of the Lower Sepik-Ramu family. Taiap is notable for its lack of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships between nouns and verbs.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Taiap does not have a system of inflectional case marking on nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role (such as subject, object, etc.) within a sentence.
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: The language uses word order and possibly other syntactic means to indicate the roles of nouns in sentences. This is a common feature in languages that lack morphological case-marking.
3. **Typological Characteristics**: Many languages in the region, particularly those in the Sepik-Ramu family, exhibit similar typological features, including the absence of morphological case-marking.

Given these points, Taiap does not employ a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Mian,"Mian, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its complex system of case marking. In Mian, nouns are marked for case to indicate their grammatical roles within sentences. The language has a productive case system that includes several distinct cases.

Mian has the following cases:
1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Dative
4. Genitive
5. Locative
6. Ablative
7. Instrumental

Given this information, Mian has a total of 7 cases. This places it in the category of ""6-7 cases.""

**Reasoning:**
Mian's case system includes a variety of cases that mark different grammatical functions, such as subject (nominative), direct object (accusative), indirect object (dative), possession (genitive), location (locative), source (ablative), and means or instrument (instrumental). The presence of these distinct cases indicates a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Inanwatan,"Inanwatan, a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. According to linguistic research, Inanwatan does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case inflections.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Inanwatan lacks a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns in Inanwatan do not change form to indicate their grammatical role within a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - The language primarily uses word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships, rather than inflectional morphology.
   - There is no evidence of a set of case paradigms that would classify Inanwatan as having multiple cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"Abui, a Papuan language spoken in the Alor archipelago of Indonesia, exhibits a case-marking system that is primarily focused on marking peripheral or concrete relations such as locatives and instrumentals. The language does not have a fully developed system of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive. Instead, it uses prepositions or postpositions to indicate these relationships, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

In Abui, the marking of cases is limited to specific semantic roles rather than a comprehensive system that covers a wide range of grammatical functions. This means that while there are markers for certain roles, such as location or instrument, these do not extend to a full paradigm of cases that would include core syntactic functions.

### Reasoning:
1. **Peripheral Case Marking**: Abui uses markers for locative and instrumental roles, which are considered peripheral or concrete cases.
2. **Lack of Core Case Marking**: There is no extensive morphological marking for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive.
3. **Use of Adpositions**: The language relies on adpositions rather than inflectional morphology to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awtuw,"Awtuw is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Sepik family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Awtuw is known for its relatively simple case system. The language primarily uses case marking to indicate syntactic roles such as subject and object, but it does not have an extensive array of cases.

Awtuw has a nominative-accusative alignment, which means it marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs in the same way (nominative), and it marks the direct object of transitive verbs differently (accusative). This results in a system with two primary cases: nominative and accusative.

Additionally, Awtuw does not have a wide range of other productive case markers for roles such as dative, genitive, or locative. Instead, these roles are often expressed through other means, such as adpositions or verb morphology.

Given this information, Awtuw has a case system that includes two productive cases.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Mehek in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abun,"Abun, also known as Yimbun, is a language spoken in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the West Papuan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Abun does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Abun does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns in Abun do not change form to indicate their grammatical roles (such as subject, object, etc.) within a sentence.
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and possibly prepositions or postpositions, to convey these grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that would categorize nouns into different cases based on their syntactic or semantic roles.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Koasati, also known as Coushatta, is a Muskogean language spoken by the Coushatta people in Louisiana and Texas. In terms of its grammatical structure, Koasati does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

Koasati uses a combination of positional syntax and verbal affixes to convey the roles of nouns in sentences, rather than inflecting the nouns themselves for case. This means that Koasati does not have a morphological case-marking system that would fit into the categories of 2 cases, 3 cases, etc.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Koasati in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Maricopa,"Maricopa, a Yuman language spoken in Arizona, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on concrete or peripheral relations rather than a full-fledged syntactic case system. The language uses suffixes to mark locative and instrumental relations, among others, but does not have a comprehensive system of morphological case marking for syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, or genitive.

Given this information, Maricopa does not fit neatly into categories with a specific number of cases (like 2, 3, 4, etc.). Instead, it falls into the category where case marking is limited to specific, often peripheral, relations.

**Reasoning:**
1. Maricopa uses suffixes to mark locative and instrumental cases.
2. It lacks a comprehensive system of morphological case marking for core syntactic roles.
3. The case marking present is more aligned with marking concrete or peripheral relations rather than syntactic functions.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"The Southern Sierra Miwok language, part of the Miwok language family, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

4. **Dative**: Used for the indirect object.
5. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.
6. **Instrumental**: Used to indicate the means by which an action is performed.

Given this information, Nez Perce has at least six distinct cases. Therefore, the appropriate category for Nez Perce is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. In Oneida, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and possessive are not marked by case inflections on nouns. Instead, these relations are typically indicated by word order and verb agreement. Oneida uses a polysynthetic structure, where much of the grammatical information is encoded in the verb rather than through case markings on nouns.

Given this information, Oneida does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Oneida in terms of case-marking is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"Pomo (Southeastern) is a language from the Pomoan family, spoken in Northern California. In terms of its grammatical structure, Southeastern Pomo does not exhibit a productive case system for marking nouns.

   - **Documentation:** The primary sources on Tunica, including the work of Mary Haas, do not describe any productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, they highlight the use of other grammatical strategies to indicate relationships between words.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Washo,"Washo, a Native American language spoken in California and Nevada, exhibits a relatively simple case-marking system. The language primarily uses suffixes to mark grammatical relations on nouns. The primary cases in Washo are:

1. **Nominative**: This is the unmarked form of the noun, used for subjects of intransitive verbs and agents of transitive verbs.
2. **Accusative**: This is marked by the suffix -š and is used for direct objects.
3. **Genitive**: This is marked by the suffix -gi and is used to indicate possession.

Given this information, Washo has a productive case paradigm of three distinct cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative case is unmarked and used for subjects.
- The accusative case is marked by -š for direct objects.
- The genitive case is marked by -gi for possessive relationships.

These three cases cover the core grammatical relations in Washo, and there is no extensive system of additional cases for other syntactic or semantic roles.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Wichita,"Wichita is a Caddoan language spoken by the Wichita people in Oklahoma. It is known for its polysynthetic nature, which means that it tends to use complex verb forms that incorporate a lot of grammatical information, including what might be expressed by cases in other languages. However, Wichita does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology and word order to indicate grammatical relations.

In Wichita, the roles that would typically be marked by cases in other languages are instead indicated through verb affixes and other syntactic means. For example, subject and object roles are often marked directly on the verb rather than on the noun. This means that Wichita does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Wichita in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Wintu, a Native American language of the Wintu-Nomlaki branch of the Penutian family, exhibits a system of case marking that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case systems. Wintu primarily uses suffixes to mark case relations on nouns, and it distinguishes between a small number of cases.

The primary cases in Wintu are:
1. **Nominative**: This case is typically unmarked and is used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: This case is marked and is used for the direct object of a sentence.
3. **Genitive**: This case is also marked and is used to indicate possession.

Given this information, Wintu has a productive case paradigm that includes three distinct cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative case is used for subjects and is generally unmarked.
- The accusative case is used for direct objects and has a specific marker.
- The genitive case is used to indicate possession and has its own marker.

Thus, Wintu fits into the category of languages with 3 cases.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",4 cases,3 cases
Acoma,"Acoma, also known as Keresan, is a language spoken by the Acoma Pueblo people in New Mexico. It belongs to the Keresan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Acoma does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Acoma does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.). Instead, Acoma uses other strategies such as word order and context to convey these relationships.
   - **Linguistic Descriptions:** Descriptions of Acoma grammar indicate that it lacks the inflectional morphology typically associated with case systems. This aligns with the characteristic of languages that do not use morphological case-marking.

Given the information and the linguistic characteristics of Acoma, it is clear that the language does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Zuni,"Zuni, a language spoken by the Zuni people in New Mexico, is known for its complex morphology. However, it does not possess a productive case system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do. Instead, Zuni relies more on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Zuni does not have a productive case system where nouns are inflected for different grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - Instead, Zuni uses other means such as word order, verb agreement, and postpositions to convey grammatical relationships.
   - The language does have some markers that might be considered similar to cases, but they do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Columbia-Wenatchi, also known as Columbia-Moses or Nxaʔamxčín, is a Salishan language spoken in the United States, specifically in the state of Washington. Salishan languages are generally known for their complex morphological systems, but they typically do not have extensive case marking systems like those found in Indo-European languages.

In Columbia-Wenatchi, the primary means of indicating grammatical relations is through word order and the use of particles rather than through a productive case system. The language employs a nominative-accusative alignment in its syntax, but this alignment is not marked by morphological case on nouns. Instead, grammatical relations are often indicated by verb morphology and word order.

Given this information, Columbia-Wenatchi does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical mechanisms to indicate relationships between nouns and verbs.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tlingit,"Tlingit is a Na-Dené language spoken by the Tlingit people in Alaska and Canada. In terms of grammatical case, Tlingit does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

In Nahuatl, the primary means of indicating grammatical relations are through the use of relational nouns (postpositions) and possessive constructions rather than through morphological case marking. For example, possession is typically indicated by possessive prefixes attached to the noun, and relational nouns are used to express locative and other relationships.

Given this information, Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns, and thus it falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language known for its complex consonantal system and relatively simple vowel system. In terms of morphology, Abkhaz is characterized by its polysynthetic nature, which means it tends to use a large number of affixes to convey grammatical relationships and meanings.

When it comes to case marking, Abkhaz does not employ a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on its rich system of verbal agreement and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships that other languages might mark with cases. This means that Abkhaz does not have a set of morphological case markers that are applied to nouns to indicate their syntactic or semantic roles within a sentence.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Abkhaz in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking

Given this extensive list, it is clear that Basque has a highly productive case system with more than ten distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Catalan, a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and parts of Valencia and France, does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to convey grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case inflections. This characteristic is typical of many Romance languages, which have largely lost the case systems that were present in their Latin ancestor.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Catalan nouns do not inflect for case. Instead, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are indicated through word order and prepositions.
   - For example, the subject of a sentence is typically placed before the verb, while the direct object follows the verb. Prepositions like ""a"" (to) and ""de"" (of) are used to indicate indirect objects and possessive relationships, respectively.
   - This lack of morphological case-marking aligns Catalan with other Romance languages like Spanish, Italian, and French, which also do not have productive case systems for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, as a Germanic language, has a relatively simplified case system compared to some other Indo-European languages. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but over time, it has undergone significant simplification. 

In contemporary Western Frisian, the case system is largely reduced. The language primarily distinguishes between the nominative and the genitive cases. The genitive case, however, is not productive and is mostly found in fixed expressions, place names, and some set phrases. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the genitive case indicates possession. 

Given this context, Western Frisian does not have a fully productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships that other languages might mark with cases.

1. Reasoning:
   - Western Frisian historically had a more complex case system, but it has largely lost this system in contemporary usage.
   - The language primarily uses nominative and genitive cases, with the genitive being non-productive and limited to specific contexts.
   - The majority of grammatical relationships are indicated through word order and prepositions rather than a productive case system.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

In terms of its grammatical structure, Kayah Li (Eastern) does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations within a sentence.

The language primarily uses postpositions and serial verb constructions to convey meanings that might be expressed through case marking in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental relations are typically indicated by specific postpositions rather than by inflectional case endings on nouns.

Given this information, Kayah Li (Eastern) falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Khanty,"Khanty, a Uralic language spoken in Russia, exhibits a relatively complex case system. The language is known for its agglutinative morphology, which means it uses affixes to express grammatical relations and functions.

Khanty has a productive case system that includes the following cases:
1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Locative
5. Lative
6. Ablative
7. Translative
8. Comitative
9. Instrumental

Given this list, Khanty has more than 8 cases. Therefore, the appropriate category for Khanty is ""10 or more cases.""

**Reasoning:**
- The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence.
- The accusative case marks the direct object.
- The genitive case indicates possession.
- The locative case is used for location.
- The lative case indicates direction towards something.
- The ablative case marks movement away from something.
- The translative case indicates a change of state or transformation.
- The comitative case denotes accompaniment.

These cases are productive and regularly used in the language, fulfilling the criteria for grammatical cases as defined.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",3 cases,10 or more cases
Korean,"Korean is known for its use of postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a traditional case system as seen in languages like Latin or Russian. However, these postpositions function similarly to cases in that they mark the role of a noun in a sentence. 

In Korean, there are several postpositions that can be considered as marking different cases:
1. **Nominative**: 이/가 (i/ga)
2. **Accusative**: 을/를 (eul/reul)
3. **Dative**: 에게/한테 (ege/hante)
4. **Locative**: 에/에서 (e/eseo)
5. **Instrumental**: (으)로 ((eu)ro)
6. **Genitive**: 의 (ui)

These postpositions are productive and are used consistently to mark the grammatical roles of nouns in sentences. Given this, Korean can be said to have a system that marks at least six distinct cases.

### Reasoning:

   - Kadiwéu does not have a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it uses other strategies to indicate grammatical relations, such as word order and adpositions.
   - The language does not have a set of inflectional endings that systematically mark different grammatical cases (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.) on nouns.
   - The absence of a productive case system means that Kadiwéu falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
