   - Nominals may take up to four cases in a specific order: adnominal, relational, modal, then complementizing or associating.

2. **List of Cases**:
   - The text lists several cases used in Kayardild: LOCative, ABLative, PROPrietive, OBLique, ALLative, INSTRumental, UTILitive, GENitive, ASSOCiative, ORIGin, PRIVative, CONSequential, and various verbal cases like Verbal Dative, Verbal Allative, Verbal Translative, Verbal Evitative, Verbal Donative, and Verbal Purposive.

3. **Case Functions**:
   - The cases are used in various syntactic and semantic functions, including marking possession, location, direction, instruments, goals, and more.

4. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The text explicitly mentions that Kayardild has a rich and complex case system, with multiple cases being used productively across different syntactic levels.

5. **Summary of Modal Case System**:
   - The modal case system in Kayardild is extensive and includes several cases that are used to indicate tense, mood, and aspect in addition to their relational functions.

Given the detailed enumeration and description of the cases, it is clear that Kayardild has a very large number of productive cases. The text lists at least 12 distinct cases (LOCative, ABLative, PROPrietive, OBLique, ALLative, INSTRumental, UTILitive, GENitive, ASSOCiative, ORIGin, PRIVative, CONSequential) and mentions additional verbal cases, which further indicates the complexity and richness of the case system.

Maranungku,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Maranungku, we can identify several instances of case marking. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Possessive Adjectives**:
   - The possessive adjectives in Maranungku follow the noun in all cases. Examples include ""ngany"" (my), ""nina"" (your), ""nanku"" (his/her). This indicates a genitive case.

2. **Pronoun Objects**:
   - The object pronouns are expressed by a series of suffixes to the affix units, such as ""-ngany"" (me), ""-nimpe"" (you singular), ""-na"" (him), etc. This suggests the presence of an accusative case.

3. **Benefactive**:
   - The benefactive forms, such as ""ngeni-la"" (for me), ""nimpe-le"" (for you singular), ""na-la"" (for him), etc., indicate a benefactive case.

4. **Privative**:
   - The privative forms, such as ""ngeni-ra"" (from me), ""nimpe-re"" (from you singular), ""na-ngara"" (from him), etc., indicate a privative case.

5. **Instrumental**:
   - The instrumental marker ""nunu"" (with) is used to indicate the instrument with which an action is performed, suggesting an instrumental case.

6. **Locative**:
   - The locative markers such as ""yena"" (on/in/at), ""penpe...yena"" (under), ""wanungu...yena"" (on top of), and general locatives like ""keni"" (here), ""yuwa"" (there), etc., indicate a locative case.

7. **Directional**:
   - The directional particles ""nungu"" (towards the speaker), ""mere"" (away from the speaker), ""yangana"" (from a place), and ""vena"" (towards a place) suggest a directional case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Maranungku exhibits a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: genitive, accusative, benefactive, privative, instrumental, and locative. Therefore, the number of cases in Maranungku falls into the category of **6-7 cases**.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can determine the number of cases in the language.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi."" This indicates that Tiwi does not use morphological case-marking for its nouns or adjectives.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the use of prepositions and locative adverbs to express locative or directional meanings. The presence of prepositions like ""kayi"" and ""kapi"" and the need for locative adverbs for more specific meanings further supports the absence of morphological case-marking. Instead, Tiwi relies on prepositions and adverbs to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

Given this information, Tiwi does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ungarinjin, we can identify the following productive case paradigms:

1. **Locative**: Marked by the postposition -ra, indicating location (e.g., ""at"", ""on"", ""in"").
2. **Adessive**: Marked by the postposition -ʔunda, indicating vicinity (e.g., ""in the vicinity of"").
3. **Allative**: Marked by the postposition -biyŋ, indicating direction (e.g., ""toward"").
4. **Lative-Translative**: Marked by the postposition -ʔyu, indicating motion up to or transformation (e.g., ""up to"", ""becoming"").
5. **Dative**: Marked by the postposition -gu, indicating purpose or goal (e.g., ""for"", ""to"").
6. **Genitive**: Marked by the postposition -naŋga, indicating possession or origin (e.g., ""of"").
7. **Instrumental**: Marked by the postposition -njiŋe, indicating means (e.g., ""by means of"").
8. **Comitative**: Marked by the postposition -guʔe, indicating accompaniment (e.g., ""with"").
9. **Vocative**: Marked by the postposition -ay, used for direct address.

These cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic relationships, including location, direction, purpose, possession, means, accompaniment, and direct address. The presence of these distinct and productive case markers indicates that Ungarinjin has a relatively rich case system.

### Conclusion:

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amharic, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Direct Object Marker**: The paragraphs describe the use of the marker ""-n"" for direct objects. This marker is used when the direct object is determined by an article, possessive pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, determined relative qualifier, adjective, or when it is a proper noun. This indicates the presence of an accusative case.

2. **Indirect Object Marker**: The indirect object is expressed by the prefix ""lə-"" attached to the noun or pronoun, indicating a dative case.

3. **Possessive Constructions**: The possessive constructions described involve suffix pronouns attached to the noun, which is a common feature in many languages but does not necessarily indicate a separate genitive case unless it is explicitly marked as such.

4. **Emphasis and Resumptive Pronouns**: The use of resumptive pronouns and emphasis markers (e.g., ""-nu"") is noted, but these do not constitute separate cases.

5. **Locative and Instrumental Uses**: There are mentions of locative and instrumental uses, but these are not marked by distinct case suffixes in the provided text.

6. **No Evidence of Additional Cases**: There is no mention of other cases such as genitive, ablative, or instrumental being marked by distinct morphological markers.

From the analysis, it is clear that Amharic has a productive case system with at least two distinct cases: nominative (unmarked) and accusative (marked by ""-n""). The dative case is marked by the prefix ""lə-"". There is no evidence of additional cases being marked morphologically in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
**3 cases**",2 cases,3 cases
Beja,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Beja, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Nominative and Accusative Cases**:
   - The text explicitly mentions that Beja distinguishes between nominative and accusative cases. The nominative case is used for subjects and vocatives, while the accusative case is used for direct objects and genitival constructions.
   - Example: ""Two cases are distinguished in the noun-phrase: nominative and accusative, corresponding respectively to the categories subject and complement.""

2. **Genitive Constructions**:
   - The genitive is discussed in the context of possessive constructions, where a genitive suffix is added to the possessor noun-phrase. However, the genitive is not treated as a separate case but rather as a suffix added to the accusative form of the noun.
   - Example: ""The possessor noun-phrase is itself in the accusative case. The genitive suffix itself differs according to the number of the noun-phrase to which it is suffixed.""

3. **No Additional Cases**:
   - There is no mention of additional cases such as dative, instrumental, locative, etc. The primary focus is on nominative and accusative cases, with genitive constructions being handled through suffixation rather than a distinct case.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The language does not exhibit exclusively borderline case-marking. The nominative and accusative cases are clearly defined and used for syntactic purposes, rather than being limited to peripheral or semantic relations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided text, Beja has a system with **2 cases**: nominative and accusative.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Middle Atlas Berber, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system as follows:

1. **State Alternation**: The text describes an alternation between the ""normal state"" and the ""construct state"" of nouns. This alternation affects the form of the noun depending on its syntactic environment, such as after prepositions or in noun complement constructions. The construct state is formed by prefixing or modifying the initial vowel of the noun. This system resembles case marking but is not explicitly identified as such.

2. **Demonstrative Suffixes and Pronouns**: The text details various demonstrative suffixes and pronouns that change form based on gender and number. However, these changes are not indicative of a case system but rather of agreement in gender and number.

3. **Possessive and Object Pronouns**: The possessive and object pronouns are described in detail, showing variations based on their syntactic position (e.g., direct object, indirect object). These pronouns do not exhibit a case system for nouns but rather for pronouns.

4. **Prepositions and Noun Complements**: The use of prepositions (e.g., ""n"" for 'of') and their interaction with nouns is described. The prepositions govern the form of the noun but do not constitute a case system.

5. **Absence of Explicit Case Paradigms**: Throughout the text, there is no mention of explicit case paradigms for nouns that would indicate a system of nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, the focus is on state alternation and prepositional constructions.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**

The analysis indicates that Middle Atlas Berber does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on state alternation and prepositional constructions to indicate syntactic relationships.",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Diola-Fogny,,no morphological case-marking,
Gimira,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, we can determine the number of cases in the language by analyzing the morphological case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph primarily discusses personal pronouns and their forms in different contexts (subject, oblique, reflexive, etc.). It mentions the oblique case form but does not provide a comprehensive list of cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph introduces postpositions formed from nouns and adverbial/case markers. It provides examples of locative and other adverbial uses but does not explicitly list the cases.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph explicitly outlines the case system in Gimira. It lists the following cases:
     - **Nominative**: Subject case with different suffixes for various pronouns and noun categories.
     - **Accusative**: Object case marked by the suffix -1S.
     - **Genitive**: Possession marked by the suffix -a ga.
     - **Dative/Benefactive**: To/for marked by the suffix -e sn.
     - **Locative**: In/on/to marked by the suffix -N or -k'an.
     - **Ablative**: From marked by the suffix -am.

From this information, we can see that Gimira has a productive case system with six distinct cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative/Benefactive, Locative, and Ablative.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Grebo, the focus is primarily on pronouns and their tonal variations, as well as their syntactic roles (subject, object, possessive, relative). There is no mention of case paradigms for nouns, nor is there any indication of morphological case-marking for nouns in the text provided. The discussion revolves around pronouns and their usage in different moods and positions, but it does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. The text discusses pronouns extensively but does not mention any case markers for nouns.
2. There is no evidence of a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads.
3. The pronouns are described in terms of their tonal variations and syntactic roles, not in terms of case inflections.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Genitival Relationship**:
   - The text describes how nouns in Igbo can follow another noun in a genitival relationship, where the tonal behavior of both nouns is involved. This indicates a syntactic relationship but does not necessarily imply morphological case marking. The genitival relationship is expressed through tonal changes rather than affixes or case markers.

2. **Subject and Object Relationship**:
   - The text explains that nouns in subject and object positions have specific tonal behaviors. For example, noun subjects retain their inherent tones in certain verb forms, and noun objects may take non-inherent tones. This again points to tonal changes rather than morphological case marking.

3. **Pronouns**:
   - Pronouns in Igbo have separable and inseparable forms, and their grammatical relations are expressed by tone and word order. The text does not mention any morphological case markers for pronouns either.

4. **Prepositions**:
   - Nouns preceded by the preposition ""na"" retain their inherent tones, with some exceptions. This suggests that prepositions, rather than case markers, are used to indicate certain relationships.

5. **General Principles**:
   - The general principles of genitival tonal behavior and the tonal changes in subject and object relationships indicate that Igbo relies heavily on tonal changes and word order to express grammatical relationships, rather than morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**

The analysis of the provided text indicates that Igbo does not use morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on tonal changes and word order to express grammatical relationships. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Igbo in terms of case marking is ""No morphological case-marking.""",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can identify several case markers that are used productively in the language. Here is a summary of the identified cases:

1. **Construct Case**: This is used when a noun is modified by another noun, an adjective, or a relative clause. It is marked by a high tone and specific suffixes depending on the gender of the noun.
2. **Directive Case**: Marked by the suffix -i, indicating direction towards.
3. **Ablative Case**: Marked by the suffix -wa, indicating direction away from.
4. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix -r or -ar, indicating the means by which an action is performed.
5. **Reason Case**: Marked by the suffix -sa, indicating the reason for an action.
6. **Background Case**: Marked by the suffix -o or its allomorphs -ee or -hee, indicating background information or a complete domain.
7. **Vocative Case**: Marked by a high tone on the penultimate syllable, used for addressing someone directly.

These cases are used productively and are attached to nouns to indicate various grammatical relationships. Therefore, Iraqw has a system of morphological case-marking with at least seven distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraph, there is no explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns in Kinyarwanda. The examples given focus on verb forms and causative constructions rather than on the inflectional morphology of nouns. The text does not provide evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns, such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc., which would indicate the presence of morphological case-marking.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph discusses verb forms and causative constructions without mentioning any case markers on nouns.
2. There is no evidence of a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads, which is the defining characteristic of grammatical case.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about case marking.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - This paragraph discusses the forms of personal pronouns, including their prefixal and suffixal variants. It mentions that the differences between these forms are phonologically determined rather than morphologically marked for case.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph explicitly states that ""Koromfe has no cases."" It clarifies that the differences between proclitic (subject and possessive) and postclitic (object) pronouns are purely phonological and not indicative of morphological case marking.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph discusses prepositions and postpositions in Koromfe, indicating that prepositions and postpositions do not agree with the nouns they govern for any grammatical category. This further supports the absence of morphological case marking.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 2 that Koromfe has no cases and the supporting information from the other paragraphs, it is clear that Koromfe does not utilize morphological case marking for its nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lango,,no morphological case-marking,
Murle,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Murle, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Nominative Case**: The nominative case is marked by -a in the singular and -i in the plural. It marks the subject of a clause.
2. **Accusative Case**: The accusative case has no specific marker and is often the default form of the noun when it appears as the object in a clause.
3. **Genitive Case**: The genitive case is marked by -u in the singular and -o in the plural. It indicates possession.
4. **Locative/Instrumental Case**: The locative/instrumental case is marked by -a in the singular and -e in the plural. It indicates location or instrument.

From this information, we can conclude that Murle has four productive case paradigms for nouns: nominative, accusative, genitive, and locative/instrumental.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative case is explicitly marked and used for subjects.
- The accusative case, while not overtly marked, is recognized as a distinct case for objects.
- The genitive case has specific markers for indicating possession.
- The locative/instrumental case has specific markers for indicating location or instrumentality.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Nama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nama, the following observations can be made regarding the case system in the language:

1. **Associative Morphemes**:
   - The language has associative morphemes like ""tii"" (my) and ""sdd"" (your), which indicate possession or relation to the speaker or the person spoken to. These forms are used to show possession or association, similar to genitive cases in other languages.

2. **Subordinative Suffix -a**:
   - The subordinative suffix -a is described as a ""case"" suffix marking noun phrases of subordinate status in the sentence. This suffix is used in various constructions, such as equational predicates, direct or indirect objects, temporal noun phrases, and others. The presence of this suffix suggests a marked case for subordination.

3. **Agentive Case**:
   - There is mention of an agentive case marked by the suffix -i in certain fixed expressions, indicating the agent of an action. This is another distinct case marking in the language.

4. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The language has a productive case paradigm with at least two distinct cases: an unmarked case (default) and a marked case (subordinative -a). Additionally, the agentive case marked by -i adds to the case system.

5. **Other Case-like Markers**:
   - The language uses various post-positions and derived post-positions to indicate spatial and temporal relations, which are not considered true cases but function similarly in marking relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Nama has a productive case system with at least three distinct cases: an unmarked case, a subordinative case marked by -a, and an agentive case marked by -i. Therefore, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Nama is:

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",2 cases,3 cases
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the following observations can be made regarding case-marking:

1. **Pronouns and Agreement Markers**:
   - Ngiti uses subject and object pronouns, which can be cliticized to the verb stem.
   - There are subject concord markers prefixed to the verb stem, which are obligatory with free-standing subject pronouns.
   - Object pronouns can also be cliticized to the verb stem in certain constructions.
   - There are separate sets of pronouns for subject, object, possessive, and indirect object functions.

2. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - There are distinct possessive pronouns for alienable and inalienable possession.
   - Inalienable possessive pronouns follow the noun, while alienable possessive pronouns precede the noun.
   - The possessive pronouns exhibit person and number distinctions.

3. **Postpositions**:
   - Ngiti has a variety of postpositions that can be used with both [+human] and [-human] nouns.
   - Some postpositions are derived from inalienable nouns and use inalienable possessive pronouns as modifiers.
   - There are postpositions with irregular paradigms that can take pronominal modifiers.

4. **Logophoric Pronouns**:
   - Ngiti uses logophoric pronouns to mark coreference with the subject of the matrix clause.
   - These pronouns can function as subject, object, and possessive pronouns.

### Analysis:
- The descriptions provided do not indicate the presence of a productive case system for marking syntactic relations on nouns themselves. Instead, Ngiti relies on a combination of pronouns, agreement markers, and postpositions to indicate grammatical relations.
- The use of postpositions and possessive pronouns suggests that Ngiti employs strategies other than morphological case-marking to express relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
- The presence of logophoric pronouns and specific possessive constructions further supports the idea that Ngiti does not have a traditional case system but rather uses other means to convey these relationships.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Ngiti does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses pronouns, agreement markers, and postpositions to express grammatical relations.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Oromo (Harar),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oromo (Harar), the language exhibits the following cases:

1. **Absolutive**: This is the unmarked case form and serves as the base for other case forms.
2. **Nominative**: This case is distinct for nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, marking the subject of the sentence.
3. **Genitive**: This case marks possession and is formed by a high tone on the final vowel of the phrase.
4. **Dative**: This case has two forms and marks the beneficiary or source of an action.
5. **Instrumental**: This case marks the means by which an action is performed.
6. **Locative**: This case marks a location that is somehow detached from the action of the predicate.

The grammar explicitly describes these six cases with distinct forms and functions. Therefore, Oromo (Harar) has six productive case paradigms.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar outlines specific morphological markers for each of these cases.
- Each case has a distinct function and form, fulfilling the criteria for productive case paradigms.
- The locative case, although it has some postpositional characteristics, is considered a case marker in the synchronic description.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Sango,,no morphological case-marking,
Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Pronouns and Determiners (Paragraph 1)**:
   - Supyire pronouns do not exhibit case distinctions. The same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and possessor. This indicates a lack of morphological case-marking for pronouns.

2. **Adpositions (Paragraph 2)**:
   - Supyire uses postpositions and prepositions to mark oblique cases. These adpositions include markers for dative, locative, instrumental, and other roles. The presence of adpositions rather than inflectional case markers suggests that Supyire does not use morphological case-marking on nouns.

3. **Peripheral Case Roles (Paragraph 3)**:
   - Peripheral case roles such as benefactive, associative, instrumental, manner, standard of comparison, external locatives, and time are marked using adpositions. This further supports the observation that Supyire relies on adpositional phrases rather than morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**

The evidence from the descriptive grammar indicates that Supyire does not employ productive case paradigms of nouns. Instead, it uses adpositions to mark various syntactic and semantic relationships, which aligns with the classification of having no morphological case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Turkana,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkana, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Absolute Case**: This is the unmarked case used for direct objects, indirect objects, and noun phrases used in isolation or moved out of the core sentence for emphasis or topicalization.
2. **Nominative Case**: Used for subject noun phrases, particularly when they follow the verb. It is also used to mark derived subjects.
3. **Genitive Case**: Used for possessors in associative constructions.
4. **Instrumental Case**: Indicates instruments with which actions are carried out and also functions as a marker for causers in relative clauses or in nominalized comparative constructions.
5. **Locative Case**: There are two types of locative cases:
   - **Locative (1)**: Indicates place or direction.
   - **Locative (2)**: Indicates source.
6. **Vocative Case**: Used for addressing people.

The grammar explicitly mentions these six cases and provides detailed descriptions and examples for each. Therefore, Turkana has a productive case paradigm with six distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yoruba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yoruba, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the classification of nouns, including human and non-human nouns, as well as the so-called pronouns. It mentions that these pronouns function as subjects and objects without qualifiers, but there is no indication of morphological case marking on these nouns or pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph introduces polymorphic nouns, which have different forms when functioning as subjects, objects, and genitival qualifiers. However, these forms are not indicative of a productive case system but rather of different syntactic positions or roles. The changes in form are context-dependent and do not constitute a systematic case paradigm.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses genitival qualifiers, which are derived from nouns and used to express various relationships such as ownership, origin, and purpose. The genitival forms are context-dependent and change based on the preceding word, but this does not represent a productive case system. Instead, it shows a form of possessive construction.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Yoruba does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on word order, context, and other syntactic structures to convey these relationships.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mambai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions to express various grammatical relations such as location, manner, and accompaniment. The prepositions listed (e.g., ""bèè"" for ""without,"" ""háá"" for ""until,"" ""má"" for ""with,"" etc.) function to mark relationships that might otherwise be expressed through case marking in other languages.

The description indicates that prepositions are the primary means of marking these relationships, and there is no mention of morphological case markers on nouns themselves. This suggests that Mambai uses prepositional phrases rather than inflectional case marking to indicate grammatical relationships.

### Reasoning:
1. **Prepositions as Primary Markers**: The language uses a set of prepositions to mark relationships such as location, accompaniment, and manner, which are typically marked by cases in languages with morphological case systems.
2. **Absence of Case Endings**: There is no evidence of case endings or inflectional morphology on nouns to indicate grammatical relations.
3. **Prepositional Phrases**: The structure and distribution of prepositional phrases are described in detail, reinforcing the role of prepositions rather than case markers.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Jamsay,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, we can make the following observations:

1. **Postpositional Phrases (PP)**:
   - Jamsay has several postpositions that follow their NP complement.
   - There is an all-purpose postposition ""le$"" that can function as dative, locative, or instrumental.
   - There are other spatial postpositions like ""bE@rE$"" (‘in’) and a Purposive-Causal postposition ""jE@"".
   - Certain nouns have a tonal locative formed by adding an L-tone at the end, resulting in forms like ""u@ro$"" (‘in the house’) from ""u@ro@"" (‘house’).

From this information, it appears that Jamsay uses postpositions to mark various grammatical relations such as dative, locative, and instrumental. Additionally, the use of tonal changes to indicate locative cases suggests a form of case marking, but it is limited to specific nouns and specific functions.

Given that the primary method of marking grammatical relations is through postpositions and tonal changes for locative cases, it does not exhibit a full-fledged case system with multiple distinct morphological cases. Instead, it shows a limited and specific use of case-like markers for peripheral functions.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of postpositions for dative, locative, and instrumental functions indicates that these roles are not marked by a productive case paradigm on nouns.
- The tonal locatives are specific to certain nouns and do not constitute a broad, productive case system.
- The use of postpositions and tonal changes for specific functions aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Overview of Cases**: The text explicitly mentions that Ik employs eight cases to encode grammatical relations between verbs and their arguments, or between arguments and modifiers (genitive). The cases listed are: Nominative, Copulative, Accusative, Ablative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, and Oblique.

2. **Case Functions**: Each of these cases has specific grammatical and semantic roles. For example, the nominative case is used for subjects in indicative main clauses and sequential subordinate clauses, while the accusative case is used for objects in indicative transitive clauses with third-person subjects and subjects of all but sequential subordinate clauses.

3. **Case Suffixes**: The text provides a detailed list of case suffixes, confirming the presence of eight distinct cases. The suffixes are:
   - Nominative: -a
   - Instrumental: -ɔ
   - Ablative: -ɔ (with different stem reduction)
   - Genitive: -ɛ
   - Dative: -kɛ
   - Accusative: -ka
   - Copulative: -kɔ
   - Oblique: -Ø

4. **Morphophonological Variations**: Although there are morphophonological variations and some suffixes share the same form (e.g., Instrumental and Ablative both use -ɔ but differ in stem reduction), they are still considered distinct cases due to their different grammatical functions.

Given this detailed description, it is clear that Ik has a well-defined and productive case system with eight distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Noun Inflection**:
   - The inflectional morphology of Emai primarily involves number marking through prefixes attached to nominal roots. There is no mention of case-marking suffixes or prefixes on nouns that would indicate different grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - The gender system in Emai is also tied to number marking rather than case marking.

2. **Pronouns**:
   - The pronouns in Emai do reflect case distinctions (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive). However, these distinctions are specific to pronouns and not to nouns in general. This suggests that while pronouns have case forms, nouns do not exhibit a productive case paradigm.

3. **Agreement and Concord**:
   - The agreement system in Emai, as described, does not show evidence of case marking. Instead, it focuses on number and gender agreement within noun phrases and between subjects and verbs.

4. **Examples and Sentences**:
   - The examples provided in the text do not show any morphological case markers on nouns. The syntactic roles of nouns are likely determined by word order and context rather than by inflectional case markers.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Emai does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. The case distinctions are limited to pronouns, and there is no evidence of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used for the subject of a verb or governed by verbs like 'to be' or 'to become'.
2. **Accusative Case**: Indicates the object of a transitive verb.
3. **Genitive Case**: Denotes possession and purpose.
4. **Dative Case**: Used as the object of verbs of giving, taking away, asking, telling, and to denote 'for', 'for the good of', 'on behalf of'.
5. **Ablative Case**: Indicates accompaniment, the means by which something is done (instrumental), and the manner in which something is done.
6. **Locative Case**: Expresses motion to, rest in or at, motion from, and learning from.

The grammar explicitly mentions these six cases and provides examples of their usage. Therefore, Nyimang has a productive case paradigm with six distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar lists and describes six distinct cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Ablative, and Locative.
- Each case has specific functions and is marked by distinct morphological endings.
- The descriptions and examples provided align with the definition of grammatical case as a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text discusses various pronominal paradigms and their functions, but it does not describe any morphological case-marking system for nouns that would indicate different grammatical relationships such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The paragraphs focus on pronominal paradigms and their usage in different syntactic positions but do not provide evidence of a case system for nouns.
   - There is no mention of noun inflections that mark different cases, which would be necessary to determine the presence of a case system.
   - The examples provided illustrate the use of pronouns in various contexts but do not show nouns being marked for case.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Seme,,no morphological case-marking,
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Unmarked Case for Core Arguments**: The language does not use morphological case markers for subjects and direct objects. Instead, these grammatical relations are expressed through word order. For example, subject NPs precede the verb, and direct objects follow the verb (e.g., ""The man sees the woman"" without any case markers).

2. **Dative Case**: The language uses the postposition ""se"" to mark indirect objects, which can be considered a dative case. This is used after verbs like ""give,"" ""show,"" and ""say"" to indicate the recipient or the person spoken to.

3. **Possessive Construction**: The possessive relationship is indicated by the postposition ""wane,"" which follows the possessor NP or pronoun. This is not typically considered a core grammatical case like nominative or accusative but is relevant for possessive constructions.

4. **Locative Cases**: There are two locative postpositions, ""ra"" and ""kuna,"" which denote location inside or immediately attached to an object or zone. These can be considered locative cases.

5. **Other Postpositions**: The language has several other postpositions indicating spatial relations (e.g., ""behind,"" ""above,"" ""under,"" ""beside,"" ""in front of,"" ""inside,"" ""facing"") and other relations like ""on, by, from, out of"" (ga), ""at the place of"" (doo), ""between, among, amidst"" (game), and quasi-prepositions like ""since"" (jaa) and ""until"" (hal).

Given this information, Koyra Chiini does not have a productive case paradigm for core grammatical relations (subject, object) but uses postpositions for various other relations. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations such as locatives or instrumentals.

**Reasoning**: The language lacks morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations (subject, object) and instead uses postpositions for other relations, fitting the definition of exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: Marked by suffixation, replacing the final vowel of the basic stem of a noun.
2. **Accusative**: Marked by suprafixation, emerging as high pitch on the final vowel segment.
3. **Genitive**: Marked by both suffixation (replacing the final vowel or adding a suffix) and suprafixation.
4. **Dative-Locative**: Marked by suffixation, attaching to the basic or genitive stem.
5. **Allative**: Marked by suffixation, attaching to the genitive stem.
6. **Ablative-Instrumental**: Marked by suffixation, attaching to the genitive stem.
7. **Oblique**: Marked by suprafixation, emerging as high pitch on the final vowel segment.

These cases are explicitly mentioned and described in terms of their morphological marking. Therefore, Sidaama has a total of seven productive cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, allative, ablative-instrumental, and oblique cases are all explicitly mentioned and described in terms of their morphological marking.
- The genitive case is counted as it does not encode categories of the possessum like number or gender and does not show explicit adjective-like properties.
- The oblique case is included as it is marked by suprafixation and has a distinct morphological marking.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kunama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kunama, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Absence of Inflectional Case:**
   - The text explicitly states that ""Inflectional case is lacking in Kunama unless Banti's tone-marked example proves to be correct."" This suggests that Kunama does not have a productive system of inflectional case marking on nouns.
   - The example provided (nom. ayld inttke ‘A cow saw him’ vs. ac. ayla kintike ‘He saw a cow’) indicates a possible tonal distinction for nominative and accusative cases, but this is not confirmed as a productive or consistent system.

2. **Use of Postpositions:**
   - The grammar mentions that relationships which can be broadly included under the category of case are realized in Kunama by the use of postpositions. This includes genitive constructions and locative expressions.
   - Examples such as ""gu'ja+bu ‘by means of a stick’"" and ""buras+ename+yn+a ‘a thing belonging to a horse’"" show that Kunama uses postpositions to express relationships typically marked by cases in other languages.

3. **Genitive Constructions:**
   - The genitive is marked by the suffix -yna, as seen in constructions like ""Possessor + Number of Possessor + Genitive (-9g) + Number of Possessed.""
   - This genitive marking does not extend to other syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc., which are typically considered core cases in languages with inflectional case systems.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking:**
   - The use of postpositions for locative and instrumental functions (e.g., ""gu'ja+bu ‘by means of a stick’"") aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a table of various suffixes and markers used in Alamblak. It mentions several suffixes that are typically associated with case marking, such as:
   - Adessive: /-kor/
   - Path: /-oha/
   - Comitative: /-pn(U/
   - Allative: /-ko/
   - Instrument: /-e/

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the possessive phrase and genitive markers. It mentions the genitive markers -ho and -oh, which are used to indicate possession.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides a detailed discussion of peripheral noun phrases and their case marking. It lists several cases and their functions:
   - Adessive: /-kor/
   - Path: /-oha/
   - Referent: /-pne/
   - Specific setting: /-n/
   - General setting: /-nane/
   - Allative: /-ko/
   - Instrument: /-e/

From the information provided, we can identify the following productive cases in Alamblak:
- **Adessive**: /-kor/
- **Path**: /-oha/
- **Referent**: /-pne/
- **Specific setting**: /-n/
- **General setting**: /-nane/
- **Allative**: /-ko/
- **Instrument**: /-e/
- **Genitive**: /-ho/, /-oh/

This gives us a total of 8 distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraph, it appears that Amele uses a combination of postpositions and clitic particles to mark various syntactic and semantic relationships. The paragraph mentions several postpositions such as ""na,"" ""ma,"" ""ca,"" ""dec,"" ""dodoc,"" ""sec,"" ""hen,"" and ""we,"" which mark different relationships like location, instrument, possession, direction, and resemblance. These markers are used to indicate the roles of nouns in sentences, but they do not form a traditional case system as seen in languages with nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

Given this information, Amele seems to rely on postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to denote grammatical relationships. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Reasoning:
1. The language uses postpositions to mark various syntactic and semantic roles.
2. There is no mention of a traditional case system with nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
3. The markers mentioned (e.g., ""na,"" ""ma,"" ""ca,"" etc.) are used for specific functions like location, possession, and direction, which are typical of peripheral case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mountain Arapesh, there is no explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns. The text primarily discusses verb classes, subject and object markers, and intonation patterns, but it does not provide evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Verb Classes and Subject/Object Markers**: The text details various verb classes and the corresponding subject and object markers. These markers are prefixed or suffixed to verbs to indicate grammatical relations, but there is no indication that nouns themselves are inflected for case.
2. **Intonation Patterns**: The discussion on intonation patterns does not relate to case marking on nouns.
3. **Absence of Case Paradigms**: There is no mention of distinct morphological forms for nouns that would indicate different cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).

Given the lack of evidence for morphological case-marking on nouns in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is:

### Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraph, there is no explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns in Asmat. The examples given focus on demonstrative pronouns and directional pronouns, but there is no indication of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The demonstrative pronouns and directional pronouns are used to indicate location and direction, but these do not constitute a case system as defined in the guidelines.

### Reasoning:
1. **Demonstrative Pronouns**: The examples given (e.g., ""a this bag"", ""ja esd that bag"") show demonstrative pronouns used with nouns, but there is no indication that these pronouns are marking grammatical cases.
2. **Directional Pronouns**: The directional pronouns (e.g., ""a/ar points in a certain direction"") indicate direction but do not function as case markers for nouns.
3. **Lack of Case Paradigm**: There is no evidence of a systematic inflectional paradigm for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

Given the absence of clear morphological case-marking on nouns, the most appropriate conclusion based on the provided paragraph is:

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraph, we can observe the following points regarding the case system in Karo Batak:

1. **Personal Pronouns**: The table of Karo personal pronouns shows different forms for independent, possessive, agentive, and objective cases. This suggests that Karo Batak has distinct morphological forms for different syntactic roles, at least for pronouns.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Independent**: ""aku"" (I)
   - **Possessive**: ""-(ng)ku"" (my)
   - **Agentive**: ""kusikami"" (we)
   - **Objective**: ""aku"" (me)

3. **Prepositional Phrases**: The examples provided show pronouns in different syntactic roles, such as:
   - ""Ras aku kam?"" (with me you)
   - ""Ibahanna surat kempak aku."" (He sent a letter to me)

4. **Restrictions**: The text mentions specific restrictions on the co-occurrence of pronouns with certain slots, indicating a structured approach to pronoun usage and case marking.

From this information, we can infer that Karo Batak has a productive case system for pronouns, with at least the following cases:
- Nominative (subject)
- Accusative (object)
- Possessive (genitive)
- Agentive (possibly ergative or a specific agentive case)

Given the evidence of distinct morphological forms for different syntactic roles, it is reasonable to conclude that Karo Batak has a case system. However, the exact number of cases for nouns (as opposed to pronouns) is not fully clear from the provided paragraph alone. 

Based on the information available, it appears that Karo Batak has at least 2-3 cases, but without further details on noun case marking, it is challenging to determine the exact number. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion based on the given data is:

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Pronouns and Possessive Pronouns**:
   - Chamorro has a detailed system of pronouns, including subject markers, object pronouns, and possessive pronouns.
   - The possessive pronouns are bound morphemes and can indicate possession (e.g., -hu for 'my', -mu for 'your', etc.).
   - Possessive pronouns can also function as subject pronouns in certain contexts, such as with Class IIIc verbs and in specific question constructions.

2. **Articles**:
   - Chamorro uses articles like si, as, and iya for proper nouns and i, ni, and nu for common nouns.
   - The articles play a significant role in marking noun phrases, especially in focus constructions.

3. **Focus System**:
   - Chamorro employs a focus system that affects the verb morphology and the marking of noun phrases.
   - Different focus constructions (actor focus, goal focus, causative focus, referential focus, and benefactive focus) use specific affixes and articles to indicate the syntactic role of noun phrases.

4. **Noun Phrase Functions**:
   - Noun phrases in Chamorro can function as subjects, objects, objects of causatives, objects of prepositions, benefactors, and instruments.
   - The language uses specific markers (articles and pronouns) to indicate these functions.

### Conclusion:
Chamorro does not exhibit a traditional case system with a large number of distinct morphological cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it relies heavily on a combination of pronouns, possessive pronouns, articles, and a focus system to mark grammatical relations. The presence of articles and pronouns that change form based on syntactic roles suggests some level of case-marking, but it is not extensive or typical of languages with a rich case system.

Given the information, Chamorro fits best under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" because it has overt marking for specific syntactic roles but does not have a full-fledged case system with multiple distinct cases.

### Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Daga,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Daga, we can analyze the presence and function of case markers in the language.

1. **Location Clitic**: The Location Clitic in Daga indicates location and instrument. It has several allomorphs (-p, -a, -i, -u) depending on the phonological context of the noun it attaches to. Examples include ""pusi-ga-p"" (on your foot) and ""puiman-i"" (at the ocean). This clitic is used to mark the location tagmeme of the clause.

2. **Substantive Clitic**: The Substantive Clitic (-a/-wa, -ewa/-awa) binds several preceding words into one nominal unit and can occur on nouns to mark a substantive relationship. It can also mark the Comment tagmeme of the Equational Clause and has various functions depending on the context.

3. **Postpositions**: Postpositions in Daga function to mark location, comparison, and temporal accompaniment. The Location Postposition (gapan/gan/gam) is used interchangeably with the Location Clitic, but the clitic is preferred when a single noun manifests the Location tagmeme.

4. **Pronouns**: Pronouns in Daga have different suffixes for possessive, purpose, emphatic, and exclusive forms. The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix -ga to the basic pronoun.

5. **Purpose Phrase**: The Purpose Phrase consists of an obligatory Axis and an optional Relator. The verb in a clause manifesting the Axis is either inflected with the Included Clause Clitic or with the Infinitive Suffix.

6. **Location Phrase**: The Location Phrase consists of an obligatory Axis joined to the rest of the clause by the optional Relator. The Location Clitic (-p) is used to mark the location in relation to a person or object.

From the analysis, it is evident that Daga employs clitics and postpositions to mark various syntactic and semantic relationships, particularly for location and instrument. However, these markers do not form a comprehensive case system that includes core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, they are more focused on peripheral or concrete relations such as location and instrument.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dani (Lower Grand Valley), the language exhibits a variety of post-positional markers that indicate spatial and non-spatial relationships. These markers include suffixes and clitics that denote locative senses such as 'in', 'into', 'at', 'on', 'toward', and 'from'. Examples include:

1. The suffix =m, which occurs with a few stems in a locative sense.
2. The suffix =la, which is productive and occurs in locative senses with meanings like 'inside' or 'into'.
3. The suffix =ma, =mo, which is productive and common, occurring in locative senses with meanings like 'toward' or 'at'.
4. The clitic -opa, -pa, which occurs in locative senses with meanings like 'on', 'onto', 'at'.
5. The clitic -en, -nen, which occurs in a variety of senses, including spatial sense meaning 'place from which'.

These markers are used to indicate various spatial relationships and are productive in the language. However, they do not form a traditional case system as seen in languages with nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, they function more like postpositions or relational markers.

Given the extensive use of these spatially oriented post-positional markers and their productivity, but the absence of a traditional case system marking core syntactic relations (such as subject, object, etc.), Dani (Lower Grand Valley) fits the description of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Reasoning:**
The language uses a variety of productive post-positional markers to indicate spatial and other relationships, but these do not constitute a traditional case system marking core syntactic relations. The markers are more akin to locative and directional postpositions rather than grammatical cases.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hamtai, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph primarily discusses adjectives and subject pronouns. There is no mention of case-marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses possessive pronouns and possessive noun phrases. The possessive pronouns are formed by adding a possessive morpheme, but there is no indication of a broader case system beyond possession.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses object pronouns and indirect object nouns. Object pronouns are marked with an object person morpheme, but this does not extend to a full case system for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses interrogative adverb sentences and the use of interrogative adverbs. There is no mention of case-marking on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses clitics that indicate relationships such as ""concerning"" or ""about."" These clitics can be attached to nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns, forming object phrases. However, these clitics do not constitute a full case system but rather specific relational markers.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses locative clitics that indicate location (e.g., ""on,"" ""at,"" ""in""). These clitics form adverbial phrases when attached to nouns and other parts of speech. Again, these are specific markers rather than a full case system.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Hamtai uses specific clitics and morphemes to indicate possession, objects, and locations. However, these markers do not form a comprehensive case system that covers a wide range of syntactic and semantic relationships. Instead, they are limited to specific functions such as possession and location.

**Reasoning**: The language does not exhibit a full-fledged case system with multiple productive cases for nouns. Instead, it uses specific markers for possession and location, which are more akin to relational markers or borderline cases.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hua, we can identify several case suffixes that are productive and used to mark various grammatical relations. Here is a summary of the identified cases:

1. **Nominative (Absolutive)**: This is the unmarked case used for subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect objects of (di)transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal compounds. It is marked by the absence of a suffix (ø).

2. **Ergative**: This case is used for the subjects of (di)transitive verbs. It has distinct forms in the singular and plural, such as /mu'/ for singular and /mi/ for plural.

3. **Locative/Allative**: This case describes both position and motion towards an object or person. It has forms like /ro'/ and /roga/.

4. **Inessive/Illative**: This case describes both position and motion into an object or person. It has forms like /vi'/, /vina/, and /vinga/.

5. **Ablative**: This case describes motion away from an object or person. It is formed by adding the suffix of separation /ri'/ to locative/allative or inessive/illative forms, resulting in forms like /roti'/ and /vingari'/.

6. **Elative**: This case also describes motion away from an object or person, specifically out of an object or person. It is formed similarly to the ablative, with forms like /viti'/.

7. **Benefactive**: This case is marked by the suffix /hi'/ and is used to indicate ""for"", ""on behalf of"", or ""about"".

8. **Comitative**: This case is marked by the suffix /Ki'/ and is used to indicate ""with"". It can also cooccur with other case suffixes.

9. **Genitive**: This case is used to create possessive phrases and is marked by suffixes like /ma'/ for singular and /'i'/ for plural.

10. **Vocative**: Although traditionally considered a case, it is syntactically distinct as it forms complete utterances. It is marked by the suffix /-e/ following the citation suffix /-a/.

Given the above information, Hua has a productive case system with at least 10 distinct cases: Nominative, Ergative, Locative/Allative, Inessive/Illative, Ablative, Elative, Benefactive, Comitative, Genitive, and Vocative.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Ilocano,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking on nouns.

1. **Case Marking on Nouns:**
   - The grammar mentions that noun markers (articles or demonstratives) inflect for case, specifically distinguishing between ""core"" and ""oblique"" cases.
   - Core nouns can be arguments of verbs and can be replaced by enclitic pronouns, while oblique nouns cannot be replaced by enclitic pronouns and are considered peripheral.
   - Examples provided show the use of core and oblique markers:
     - Core: ""ti"" (singular), ""dagití"" (plural)
     - Oblique: ""iti"" (singular), ""kadagiti"" (plural)
   - Personal articles also show this distinction:
     - Core: ""ni"" (singular), ""da"" (plural)
     - Oblique: ""kenni"" (singular), ""kadá"" (plural)

2. **Pronouns:**
   - Pronouns in Ilocano inflect for ergative, absolutive, and oblique cases.
   - The grammar provides paradigms for these pronouns, indicating a clear morphological distinction between these cases.

3. **Summary of Cases:**
   - Core (which includes both ergative and absolutive as per the pronoun paradigms)
   - Oblique

Given this information, Ilocano has a productive case system that distinguishes between two primary cases: core (which includes ergative and absolutive) and oblique.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, we can identify the following productive case markers:

1. **Locative (-ia)**: This case marker is used to indicate location and cause. It can be attached directly to common nouns and is sometimes preceded by the possessive marker for [+Human] referents.
2. **Source (-n&i)**: This marker indicates the source and must be preceded by the locative marker -ia.
3. **Instrumental (-na)**: This marker denotes the object with which an action is carried out. It can also indicate possession and coordination.
4. **Goal (-m)**: This marker has both semantic and syntactic functions. It marks goals, purposes, recipients, beneficiaries, and certain types of objects. It is also used for disambiguation and marking accompaniers.

The grammar explicitly mentions five case markers, which are:

- Locative/Causal: -ia
- Source: -n&i
- Instrumental: -na
- Goal: -m

The fifth case marker, -m, is particularly versatile and serves multiple functions, including marking objects under certain conditions, which adds to its syntactic significance.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",5 cases,5 cases
Atayal,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, we can identify the following case markers and their functions:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is used to mark the subject of a sentence. Examples include ""saku'"" (1SG), ""hiya’"" (3SG), etc.
2. **Genitive Case**: This is used to indicate possession. Examples include ""mu"" in ""Ikotas mu maray pehu'"" (‘my late Grandfather Maray Pehu’).
3. **Dative Case**: This is used to mark the indirect object, often the recipient or beneficiary of an action, and is also used for direct objects of active verbs. Examples include ""knan"" (1SD) and the marker ""sa"" or ""s"" for other forms.

The grammar explicitly mentions these three cases: nominative, genitive, and dative. There is no indication of additional cases such as accusative, instrumental, locative, etc., within the provided text. Therefore, based on the information given, Atayal has a productive case system with three distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kewa, we can identify several case markers that indicate the presence of a productive case system. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Agentive/Instrumentive (-me)**: This marker is used to indicate the agent or instrument in a sentence. Examples include ""aa-mc"" (man-AGN) and ""rai-mi"" (axe-IN).

2. **Genitive (-na)**: This marker is used to indicate possession. Examples include ""nipuna"" (3sg Pro-POSR) and ""wanena"" (daughter-POSR).

3. **Locative (-para)**: This marker indicates location. Examples include ""Putipara"" (Puti-LOC) and ""ada-para"" (house-LOC).

4. **Accusative (-daa)**: This marker is used to indicate the object of a verb. Although not explicitly shown in the provided text, the description mentions its function.

5. **Directive (-nane)**: This marker indicates direction. Examples include ""adaamaa pu-nane"" (big, garden-DIR).

6. **Other markers**: The text also mentions other functional markers like ""benefactive"" and ""ablative,"" which are included under the locative marker (-para).

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the text, Kewa has a productive case system with at least five distinct cases: Agentive/Instrumentive, Genitive, Locative, Accusative, and Directive. Therefore, the number of cases in Kewa can be classified as:

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",6-7 cases,5 cases
Kobon,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kobon, we can analyze the presence of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Pronouns and Case Functions:**
   - The text mentions pronouns functioning as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, and benefactives. This suggests that Kobon has distinct forms for these grammatical roles.
   - The pronouns are marked for different functions, indicating a system of case-marking.

2. **Examples of Case Usage:**
   - The examples provided show different forms of pronouns depending on their syntactic role (e.g., subject, object, etc.). This is a clear indication of case-marking.
   - For instance, the pronoun forms for ""you"" (2nd person singular) and ""I"" (1st person singular) change based on their function in the sentence.

3. **Number of Cases:**
   - The text does not explicitly list all the cases, but it provides enough evidence to infer the presence of at least nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), dative (indirect object), and possibly a benefactive case.
   - This suggests that Kobon has at least four cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Kobon appears to have a system of case-marking with at least four distinct cases.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Kombai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Nominal Morphology**:
   - The first paragraph mentions that the nominal morphology in Kombai is simple and that nouns do not have non-singular forms. This suggests a lack of complex inflectional morphology for nouns.
   - It also states that nouns can take possessive pronominal prefixes, but there is no other noun-related morphology.

2. **Nouns and Possession**:
   - The second paragraph reiterates that nouns can take possessive pronominal prefixes. This is a form of head-marking rather than dependent-marking, which is typical for case systems.
   - There is no mention of other morphological markers for cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

3. **Pronouns**:
   - The pronouns section lists personal pronouns and their possessive forms. However, these possessive forms are prefixes rather than suffixes or separate case markers.
   - Reflexive pronouns are formed by adding a suffix (-ra), but this is more indicative of a reflexive construction rather than a case system.

4. **Absence of Case Marking**:
   - There is no evidence of morphological case-marking for syntactic roles (such as subject, object, etc.) in the provided text. The language appears to rely on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations.

Given the information, Kombai does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. The possessive prefixes and reflexive suffixes do not constitute a case system as defined in the guidelines.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Locative Suffix**: The text mentions the Locative suffix ""-n"" which is used to indicate general static location, both temporal and spatial. This suffix is applied to a restricted subclass of nouns, including time nouns, place nouns, body parts, positional nouns, and other miscellaneous nouns.

2. **Perlative Suffix**: The Perlative suffix ""-ne"" refers to motion through some material or terrain or along a line. It is noted to be quite rare and is used with a similar subclass of nouns as the Locative suffix.

The presence of these two suffixes indicates that Lavukaleve has at least two productive case paradigms: Locative and Perlative. There is no mention of additional case markers that would suggest a larger case system.

**Reasoning**:
- The Locative suffix ""-n"" and the Perlative suffix ""-ne"" are clearly described as productive morphological markers for specific syntactic and semantic functions.
- There is no evidence in the provided text of additional case markers beyond these two.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Madurese,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Madurese, it is clear that Madurese does not exhibit productive case paradigms for nouns. The text explicitly states that ""there is no case marking on NPs in Madurese, with the exception of the first person singular possessive."" This indicates that Madurese lacks a system of morphological case-marking for grammatical relations, as the same pronominal forms are used regardless of their grammatical role in the sentence.

### Reasoning:
1. The paragraph explicitly mentions the absence of case marking on noun phrases (NPs) in Madurese.
2. The examples provided illustrate that the same pronominal forms are used for different grammatical roles without any morphological changes to indicate case.
3. The only exception noted is the first person singular possessive, which does not constitute a productive case paradigm for the language as a whole.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,,no morphological case-marking,
Palauan,"### Conclusion: No morphological case-marking

### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Palauan, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The language uses relational words like ""er"" to indicate relationships such as location, direction, source, cause, and comparison, rather than inflectional case markers on nouns. The examples provided show that Palauan relies on prepositional phrases and word order to convey grammatical relationships, rather than morphological case marking. This is consistent with languages that do not use morphological case-marking systems.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Pronouns and Near Relationship Terms:**
   - The first paragraph discusses the morphology of pronouns and near relationship terms. It mentions different forms of personal pronouns that can be distinguished based on phonetic root changes or apophony. These forms serve various grammatical functions such as absolute forms, possessive forms, and reflexive forms.
   - The possessive forms are particularly noted, with examples like ""da ahamam"" (my food) and ""na falam"" (his tail). The possessive forms are used with nouns to indicate possession, but there is no indication of a broader case system beyond possessive marking.

2. **Postpositional Phrases:**
   - The second paragraph discusses postpositional phrases, which consist of a noun, pronoun, or verbal form followed by a postposition. Examples include ""ifa na"" (in the canoe), ""bu na"" (in the water), and ""jo da"" (to the village).
   - These constructions indicate that Sentani uses postpositions to mark relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence, rather than using a system of morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Sentani does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositional phrases to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Sentani is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the Suena grammar, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological markers and their functions. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Locative Case**: There is mention of a locative suffix ""-ra"" used with common nouns to indicate location (e.g., ""emara"" meaning ""in the house"").
2. **Possessive Case**: There are possessive markers such as ""-re"" used to indicate possession (e.g., ""Zaipore"" meaning ""Zaipo's"").
3. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental function is indicated by the use of ""-nana"" (e.g., ""Zaipo nana ota"" meaning ""Zaipo hit with an axe"").
4. **Benefactive Case**: The benefactive function is marked by ""-re"" (e.g., ""Zaipo-to give"" meaning ""give to Zaipo"").
5. **Comitative Case**: The comitative function is marked by ""-waure"" (e.g., ""ema waure"" meaning ""man with wealth"").

These markers indicate that Suena has a system of morphological case-marking for various syntactic and semantic relations, including locative, possessive, instrumental, benefactive, and comitative cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of distinct morphological markers for locative, possessive, instrumental, benefactive, and comitative functions suggests that Suena has a productive case system.
- The cases identified are concrete and semantic, fitting the definition of grammatical cases as marking dependent nouns for their relationship to heads.

**Conclusion**: 5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Taba,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taba, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Prepositions and Postpositions**:
   - Taba uses prepositions such as ""ada"" (comitative/instrumental), ""pake"" (instrumental), ""untuk"" (beneficiary), and ""lo"" (similative).
   - There is also a locative postposition ""/i"" which translates to various locative meanings like 'in', 'at', 'on', and sometimes 'by'.

2. **Applicative Marking**:
   - The language uses applicative suffixes to mark certain roles, such as the -o suffix for beneficiaries.

3. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Possessive noun phrases are formed by preposing a possessor noun to a possessed noun, linked by a possessive particle marked for the number and person of the possessor.

4. **Pronouns and Cross-Referencing**:
   - Taba has a system of pronouns and cross-referencing proclitics that mark person and number but does not indicate a case system for these pronouns.

### Analysis:

- The use of prepositions and postpositions in Taba suggests that the language relies on adpositional phrases to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.
- The presence of applicative suffixes indicates some morphological marking, but these are specific to certain roles (e.g., beneficiaries) and do not constitute a full case system.
- The possessive constructions and pronoun systems do not indicate additional cases but rather show agreement in person and number.

### Conclusion:

Given the reliance on prepositions, postpositions, and applicative suffixes for marking relationships typically handled by cases in other languages, Taba does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses adpositional and applicative strategies to mark these relationships.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tagalog, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Personal Pronouns and Deictic Pronouns**:
   - Tagalog has personal pronouns that change form based on their syntactic function in the sentence. These forms are categorized into ang forms (nominative), ng forms (genitive), and sa forms (locative/dative).
   - Deictic pronouns also have different forms depending on their syntactic function: ang forms, ng forms, and sa forms.

2. **Personal Nouns**:
   - Personal nouns (names of specific persons) are marked by the markers si (nominative), ni (genitive), and kay (locative/dative).

3. **Unmarked Nouns**:
   - Unmarked nouns (common nouns) do not change form but are preceded by markers that indicate their syntactic function: ang (nominative), ng (genitive), and sa (locative/dative).

4. **Case Functions**:
   - The nominative case (ang) marks the subject or topic of the sentence.
   - The genitive case (ng) marks possessors and agents in passive constructions.
   - The locative/dative case (sa) marks the indirect object or location.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Tagalog has a productive case-marking system with three distinct cases: nominative, genitive, and locative/dative. These cases are marked either by changes in the form of pronouns or by the use of specific markers preceding nouns.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tukang Besi, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The text mentions the use of nominative (na) and non-nominative (te) articles to mark core arguments in clauses.
   - It also describes the use of oblique predicates, which involve oblique case phrases or prepositional phrases.
   - Examples show the nominative article ""na"" marking subjects and the non-nominative article ""te"" marking other core arguments.
   - The text discusses the use of the oblique article ""i"" for marking oblique phrases.

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - The text describes right dislocation and the use of articles in such constructions.
   - It reiterates the use of nominative (na) and non-nominative (te) articles.
   - The text mentions that the structure and choice of nominative or non-nominative case are monitored by pronominal affixing on the verb and the choice of articles on nominals.

3. **Paragraph 3:**
   - The text discusses the use of articles in Tukang Besi, including the nominative (na), non-nominative (te), oblique (i/di), and genitive (nu).
   - It highlights that the nominative and non-nominative articles are used with all core NPs, while the oblique article is used with oblique NPs.
   - The genitive article (nu) is used only with genitive expressions inside another NP.

4. **Paragraph 4:**
   - The text describes the structure of prepositional phrases and their use in introducing adjunct arguments.
   - It differentiates between articles and prepositions, noting that prepositions can appear with a bare NP or a KP.
   - The text provides examples of prepositional phrases and their structure.

5. **Paragraph 5:**
   - The text discusses possession and possessive constructions, including the use of possessive suffixes and the genitive article (nu).
   - It provides examples of genitive constructions and their structure.
   - The text mentions that the genitive article (nu) can be cliticized onto the preceding noun.

### Analysis:

- **Nominative Case (na):** This is used to mark the subject of a clause.
- **Non-nominative Case (te):** This is used to mark other core arguments that are not the subject.
- **Oblique Case (i/di):** This is used for oblique phrases, indicating roles such as location, direction, and source.
- **Genitive Case (nu):** This is used for possessive constructions within noun phrases.

The presence of these articles indicates that Tukang Besi has a system of case-marking for core arguments (nominative and non-nominative), oblique arguments, and possessive constructions. However, the case-marking system is relatively simple, with a clear distinction between core and oblique arguments and a specific marker for possession.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Tukang Besi exhibits a case-marking system with four distinct cases: nominative, non-nominative, oblique, and genitive. Therefore, the appropriate classification is:

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",no morphological case-marking,4 cases

8. **Referential Case**: Marked by suffix -ti.
9. **Reflexive Case**: Marked by suffix -baramnyi.

These cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic relationships, including subject marking for transitive and intransitive verbs, possession, location, direction, means, beneficiary, and reflexivity.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",no morphological case-marking,10 or more cases
Usan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Usan, we can identify several key points relevant to determining the number of productive case paradigms in the language:

1. **Postpositions and Clitics**:
   - Usan uses postpositions such as ""nob"" and ""ten"" for comitative relations (e.g., ""with"" or ""accompanied by"").
   - The adpositional clitic ""-t"" is used to signal various semantic functions including locative, time, instrument, beneficiary, cause, and purpose.

2. **Examples of Case-like Marking**:
   - The clitic ""-t"" is attached to nouns to indicate locative, instrumental, and other relations (e.g., ""iyau wambin-t"" meaning ""at the fireplace"").
   - The comitative postpositions ""nob"" and ""ten"" are used to indicate accompaniment (e.g., ""munon eng wonou umour nob"" meaning ""the man with his younger brother"").

3. **Absence of Core Grammatical Cases**:
   - There is no mention of core grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, or dative being marked morphologically on nouns.
   - The examples provided show that relational meanings are conveyed through postpositions and clitics rather than through inflectional case endings on nouns.

4. **Nominal Modifiers and Possessives**:
   - Possessive pronouns precede the possessed noun (e.g., ""yonou munai"" meaning ""my house"").
   - There is no indication that possessive relationships are marked by case endings on the nouns themselves.

5. **Reduplication and Affixation**:
   - Reduplication and affixation are used for various grammatical and semantic functions, but these do not constitute case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided text, Usan does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions and clitics to indicate peripheral or semantic relations such as locative, instrumental, and comitative. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Usan is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Oblique Suffix -n/-nan**: The text describes the oblique suffix -n (singular) and -nan (non-singular) as the single nominal case marker in Yimas. This suffix is used to mark a range of peripheral, adverbial-like case uses, such as instruments, locatives, and temporals. Examples include:
   - ""tktntrm-nan namarawt na-:ua-tpul"" ('The person hit me with two chairs.')
   - ""tnumut-jlan ama-na-irm-n"" ('I'm standing at the two sago palms.')
   - ""tpuk ku-ka-pay-pra-t mara:uapaw1-Jlan"" ('I carried the sago pancake in the two baskets.')

2. **Allomorphic Variation**: The choice between -n and -nan is determined by number (singular vs. non-singular) and is subject to some irregularities and complications. For example:
   - Singular forms almost always take -n, except those ending in segments associated with F (e.g., /i/, /ay/, /l/), which take -nan.
   - Dual forms consistently take -nan.
   - Plural forms vary, with some taking -nan and others -n based on specific morphological and phonological rules.

3. **Proper Nouns**: Proper nouns in Yimas do not take number inflections and generally do not occur with the oblique suffix, except for some place names and village names used locatively.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Yimas has a single productive case paradigm marked by the oblique suffix -n/-nan, which is used for various peripheral functions. This indicates that Yimas has a minimal case system with only one overtly marked case category.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can identify the following productive case markers:

1. **Nominative (te)**: Used to mark the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative (ke, kèmu, kumu)**: Used to mark the object, which can include patients, recipients, targets, locations, and certain temporal expressions.
3. **Dative (ni)**: Used to mark beneficiaries, purposes, addressees, and non-patient-like complements of certain verbs.
4. **Instrumental (fini, namu)**: Used to mark instruments or source materials, and also in certain temporal expressions.
5. **Comitative (kumu)**: Used to indicate accompaniment or 'together with'.

These markers are used to denote syntactic and semantic relations between noun phrases and predicates, and they appear in the final position of the phrase. The use of these markers is generally optional, depending on the context.

### Conclusion:
**5 cases**",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Manambu, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the case forms and their functions as described.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions various cases such as the accusative/locative (-Vm), dative-aversive (-Vk), allative-instrumental (-Vr), terminative (-Vb), comitative (-wa), transportative (-Vsap, -Vsay), and substitutive (-yæy).
   - Table 3.5 lists these cases and their grammatical functions, indicating a variety of cases used to mark different syntactic and semantic roles.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The text explicitly states that ""Manambu has a system of nine case forms.""
   - It also mentions that these nine forms can correspond to eighteen different functions, but the primary count of distinct forms is nine.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The summary reiterates that Manambu has nine case forms.
   - It discusses the possibility of interpreting the system as having more cases based on function, but the primary interpretation is based on the nine distinct forms.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Manambu has **9 distinct case forms**. Therefore, the appropriate option is:

**Conclusion: 8-9 cases**",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can identify several instances of case marking:

1. **LOC-marked NPs**: The examples (60) to (63) and (67) to (68) show the use of the locative case marker `-ta` to indicate the location or recipient in various contexts. This indicates that Duna has a locative case.

2. **CS-marked NPs**: The subject arguments can be marked with `-ka` (CS), as seen in examples (63), (65), and (66). This suggests the presence of a case that marks subjects, possibly a nominative or ergative case.

3. **Possessive marking**: The possessive relation is marked with `-ya` (BEN), as seen in examples (184) to (187). This indicates the presence of a genitive or possessive case.

4. **Instrumental marking**: The instrumental case is marked with `-ka` (INSTR), as seen in examples (65) and (66). This indicates the presence of an instrumental case.

5. **Specificity marking**: The specificity marker `-na` is used in various contexts, such as in examples (186) and (187). This could be indicative of a specific case or a marker that functions similarly to a case in certain contexts.

6. **Plural marking**: The plural marker `-nu` is used in examples (202) and (203). While this is more of a number marker, it is relevant to the discussion of case marking as it shows morphological marking on nouns.

From these observations, we can infer that Duna has at least the following cases:
- Locative (`-ta`)
- Subject marking (possibly nominative or ergative, `-ka`)
- Possessive/Genitive (`-ya`)
- Instrumental (`-ka`)

Given the presence of these distinct cases, Duna appears to have a productive case system with at least four cases.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Ergative Case**:
   - The ergative case is marked by clitics that attach to noun phrases and personal pronouns to indicate the subject of a transitive verb. The ergative clitics encode gender and number (e.g., =ŋi for masculine, =yi for feminine, =gi for plural).

2. **Peripheral Cases**:
   - The language has five peripheral cases, which include:
     - **Possessive Case**: Marks possession, association, and part-whole relationships.
     - **Locative Case**: Specifies location in time and space, covering relationships such as allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal, and durative.
     - **Ablative Case**: Expresses movement away from a person, place, or object, or an action of revelation.
     - **Perlative Case**: Expresses movement along, through, or by means of.
     - **Dative Case**: Used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison, and other relations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Taiap has a total of six cases: ergative, possessive, locative, ablative, perlative, and dative. Therefore, the number of cases in Taiap is best categorized as:

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mian,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can make the following observations:

1. **Postpositions**: The language uses postpositions such as ""baka"" (with), ""y"" (at, to), and ""su"" (near) to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. These postpositions are used with noun phrases to express comitative, spatial, and other relations.

2. **Absence of Case Marking**: There is no mention of morphological case marking on nouns in the provided text. Instead, relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are expressed through postpositions.

3. **Quantifiers and Numerals**: The section on quantifiers and numerals does not indicate any case marking either. The numerals agree in gender with the nouns they modify, but this agreement is not indicative of case marking.

Given this information, it appears that Mian does not employ morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to express relationships that might otherwise be marked by cases.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Inanwatan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, the following observations can be made:

1. **Postpositions**: The language uses a variety of postpositional clitics to express semantic relations of peripheral NPs to the predicate. Examples include:
   - `-wai` (to(wards))
   - `-tewe` (from)
   - `-wo` (in, at)
   - `-ra` (to, for)
   - `-(u)ru` (with)
   - `-go` (a general circumstantial postposition for time, instrument, manner, and place)

2. **Core Nominals**: Core nominals (subjects and objects) are unmarked and distinguished by word order. They do not take postpositions and are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes.

3. **Peripheral Nominals**: Peripheral nominals take postpositions and are not cross-referenced in the verb. These postpositions indicate various semantic roles such as location, direction, instrument, and manner.

4. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: The language does not exhibit morphological case-marking on nouns to indicate grammatical relations. Instead, it relies on word order for core arguments and postpositions for peripheral arguments.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, Inanwatan does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The language uses postpositions to express semantic relations, which aligns with the feature value ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Morphological Structure**:
   - Abui is described as having an agglutinative morphological structure with elaborate verbal morphology.
   - Nouns in Abui inflect only for the possessor and do not inflect for number or gender.

2. **Case Inflection**:
   - It is explicitly stated that there is no case inflection of noun phrases (NPs) in Abui.
   - Grammatical relations are signaled with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb constructions.

3. **Possessive Inflection**:
   - The only inflectional morphology present on nouns is for possession, which involves pronominal prefixes indicating the possessor.

Given these points, it is clear that Abui does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The language relies on other means, such as pronominal prefixes and serial verb constructions, to indicate grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awtuw,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can determine the number of cases in the language by analyzing the productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the breakdown of the case markers mentioned:

1. **Unmarked Case**: This is the default form for subjects and predicate NPs.
2. **Object Case (O)**: Marked by suffixes -re/-te/-e for nouns unmarked for number, and -el-i/-ol-e for personal pronouns, dual, plural, and generic nouns.
3. **Instrumental/Comitative Case (I)**: Marked by the suffix -k, always attached to a form with the Object suffix.
4. **Possessive Case (P)**: Marked by the suffix -ke/-ka, occurring on pronouns and nouns with number marking.
5. **Locative Case (L)**: Marked by suffixes -ke/-ko/-ka after vowels and -e/-o/-a after consonants.
6. **Vocative Case (V)**: Marked by the suffix -wo/-a, used to attract the attention of the addressee.

From this analysis, we see that Awtuw has six distinct productive case markers: Unmarked, Object, Instrumental/Comitative, Possessive, Locative, and Vocative. Therefore, Awtuw has a total of six cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct morphological markers for different syntactic and semantic functions.
- Each case marker has specific forms and functions, indicating a productive case system.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it primarily uses prepositions to indicate spatial, temporal, and other relational meanings. The examples provided show a reliance on prepositions such as ""bari"" (from), ""ku"" (to, at, in), ""ma"" (to, at, in), ""pu"" (to, at, in), and ""si"" (to) to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. There is no evidence of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves, which would indicate a system of grammatical cases.

### Reasoning:
1. **Prepositions over Cases**: The language uses prepositions extensively to indicate various relationships, which suggests that it does not rely on morphological case-marking.
2. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: There is no mention of case paradigms or inflectional endings on nouns that would indicate different cases.
3. **Spatial and Temporal Relations**: These are handled by prepositions rather than case endings, further supporting the absence of a case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Locative/Instrumental Clitic =k**:
   - The clitic =k functions as a case marker covering locative (LOC) and instrumental (INS) meanings. It is used to mark locations, instruments, temporal adjuncts, and complements of verbs meaning 'become'.
   - Examples (230) to (265) illustrate various uses of this clitic, showing its role in marking locative and instrumental relationships.

2. **Relational Nouns**:
   - The language also uses relational nouns to express locative and other spatial relationships. These nouns inherently carry locative meanings and function similarly to postpositions.
   - Examples (266) and (267) show the use of relational nouns without the locative clitic, indicating that these nouns themselves are sufficient to express locative relationships.

3. **Subjects and Objects**:
   - Subjects and objects are not marked for their roles in the clause, except for personal pronouns. Nominal subjects and objects are distinguished by their position in the sentence rather than by morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Mehek primarily uses a locative/instrumental clitic and relational nouns to mark certain semantic roles. There is no evidence of a broader, productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or genitive. Therefore, the language does not exhibit a full-fledged case system but rather relies on specific markers for locative and instrumental roles.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, we can infer the following:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that Abun uses prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking.
   - It highlights the extensive use of particles for grammatical communication, with affixation playing a minimal role.
   - The lack of affixation in Abun syntax suggests that case marking is not a prominent feature.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It states that Abun subjects and objects are encoded by word order alone, without any case-marking or other coding devices.
   - The basic word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
   - There is no mention of any morphological case marking on nouns.

Given this information, it is clear that Abun does not utilize morphological case marking to indicate grammatical relations. Instead, it relies on word order and particles for grammatical functions.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, the language exhibits a productive case system with the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: Marks the subject of a verb.
2. **Accusative**: Marks the direct object of a verb.
3. **Autonomous**: Used in citation, as the form of a noun followed by an adjective, and as a vocative for nouns without a true vocative case.
4. **Locative**: Indicates the location where an action takes place.
5. **Allative**: Indicates motion towards a location.
6. **Inessive**: Indicates location within a bounded area.
7. **Vocative**: Used for proper names and certain kinship terms.

The grammar explicitly mentions that there are seven different cases in Koasati, and no noun occurs with more than six cases simultaneously. This aligns with the classical terminology for cases, even though the functions may not exactly match classical definitions.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Maricopa,"1. **Reasoning:**
   Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maricopa, the language exhibits a productive case system with multiple distinct case markers. The identified cases include:
   - **-sh**: Subject, predicate noun
   - **0**: Object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject predicate nominal and nominalized clauses
   - **-m**: Comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topic of', 'by way of' directional
   - **-li**: Locative (at) and illative (to/toward)
   - **-ly**: Locative (in/on) and illative (into/to)
   - **-k**: General locative and directional

   These markers indicate that Maricopa has a system of at least six distinct cases: subject, object, comitative/instrumental, locative (with multiple specific locative markers), and directional. The presence of multiple locative markers suggests a nuanced system for indicating location and direction, but they are still considered distinct cases within the broader locative category.

2. **Conclusion:**
   6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Sierra Miwok, the language exhibits the following case suffixes:

1. **Nominative**: Zero or |-?| depending on the phonological environment.
2. **Accusative**: |-j|.
3. **Temporal**: |-n|.
4. **Vocative**: Zero or |-?| depending on the phonological environment.
5. **Genitive**: |-y| or |-n°-|, with specific allomorphs for autonomous and subordinate cases.
6. **Ablative**: |-m:-| or |-m-| depending on the preceding morpheme.
7. **Allative**: |-t-| or |-tHo-| depending on the preceding theme.
8. **Locative**: |-m-|.
9. **Instrumental**: |-Hs-|.

These case suffixes indicate that Southern Sierra Miwok has a productive case system with nine distinct morphological cases. Each case suffix is used to mark different syntactic and semantic relationships of nouns within sentences.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct suffixes for nominative, accusative, temporal, vocative, genitive, ablative, allative, locative, and instrumental cases.
- Each case suffix is used productively to mark specific grammatical functions.
- The presence of these nine distinct case markers indicates a robust case system.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Nez Perce,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nez Perce, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Unmarked Case**: This is the default form used for subjects of intransitive verbs and direct objects of transitive verbs.
2. **Ergative/Genitive Case**: Marked by suffixes such as -nim, -nm, -m, this case is used for the subjects of transitive verbs and for possessive constructions.
3. **Direct Object Case**: Marked by the suffix -ne, used for direct objects of transitive verbs.
4. **Ablative Case**: Marked by suffixes such as -pkin'ix, -kin'ix, -me, indicating movement away from something.
5. **Locative Case**: Marked by the suffix -pe, indicating location.
6. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix -ki, indicating the means by which an action is performed.
7. **Associative Case**: Marked by the suffix -iin, indicating accompaniment.
8. **Allative Case**: Marked by suffixes such as -px, -x, -kex, indicating movement towards something.
9. **Benefactive Case**: Marked by the suffix -'ayn, indicating the beneficiary of an action.
10. **Resultative Case**: Marked by the suffix -wecet, indicating the result or reason for an action.
11. **Temporal Case**: Marked by the suffix -met, indicating time-related aspects.

Given these observations, Nez Perce exhibits a rich case system with a variety of syntactic and semantic roles marked by distinct morphological suffixes.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Oneida,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oneida, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Possessive Prefixes:**
   - The possessive prefixes (e.g., ""ak-"", ""sa-"", ""lao-"", etc.) indicate possession but do not constitute case-marking in the traditional sense. They are more akin to possessive pronouns in English (e.g., ""my"", ""your"", ""his"").

2. **Noun Suffixes:**
   - The locative suffixes (-ke, -hne, -aku, -oku, -akta) indicate spatial relations such as ""on"", ""in"", ""under"", ""near"". These are examples of concrete or peripheral case relations.
   - Plural suffixes (-shuha, -shu, -hokw, -hokiha, -o'ki) indicate plurality and are not related to case-marking.
   - Population suffixes (-akd, -h/o‘/i) and other specialized suffixes (e.g., -kéha?, -ké, -k4, -4a?) indicate various semantic or derivational meanings and do not function as grammatical cases.

### Reasoning:

The locative suffixes in Oneida are the primary indicators of case-like marking, but they are limited to expressing spatial relations. There is no evidence of a broader, productive case system that marks core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, the marking is restricted to locative and similar spatial relations.

### Conclusion:

Given the presence of locative suffixes and the absence of a broader case system, Oneida falls under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southeastern Pomo, we can identify several case suffixes that are used productively in the language. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Object Case Suffix (-il)**: This suffix marks the object case, as seen in examples like /xqo+mfotil/ ‘dog’ and /hayutil/ ‘cat’.

2. **Locative Case Suffix (-y)**: This suffix is used to indicate location, as in /mot+y/ ‘in the water’ and /xé4yil/ ‘in the boat’.

3. **Benefactive Case Suffix (-itib)**: This suffix marks the benefactive case, as in /hayutib/ ‘for the dog’ and /toncititib/ ‘for the baby’.

4. **Possessive Case Suffix (-it+baq)**: This suffix indicates possession, as in /?uyitit+bag/ ‘the baby's mother’ and /hayutittbag/ ‘the dog's’.

5. **Another Locative Case Suffix (-w)**: This suffix means 'within' or 'into a covered space', as in /ca+w/ ‘in the house’ and /xatw/ ‘into the mouth’.

From the above, we can identify at least five distinct cases:

1. **Object Case**: Marked by the suffix -il.
2. **Locative Case**: Marked by the suffix -y.
3. **Benefactive Case**: Marked by the suffix -itib.
4. **Possessive Case**: Marked by the suffix -it+baq.
5. **Another Locative Case**: Marked by the suffix -w.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",6-7 cases,5 cases
Slave,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Slave language primarily discuss the extensive use of postpositions to indicate various semantic functions such as location, time, instrument, cause, accompaniment, goal, and recipient. The examples illustrate how postpositions are used to mark relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

Key points to consider:
1. **Postpositions vs. Cases**: The paragraphs describe the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers. Postpositions are separate words that follow the noun, unlike case markers which are typically affixes attached to the noun.
2. **Semantic Functions**: The postpositions cover a wide range of semantic functions, including locative, instrumental, and temporal relations, which are often expressed through cases in other languages.
3. **No Inflectional Paradigms**: There is no mention of inflectional paradigms for nouns that would indicate a system of morphological case-marking. Instead, the relationships are expressed through the use of postpositions.

Given these points, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm of nouns but relies on postpositions to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Squamish, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions two case forms: Absolutive and Relative.
   - The Absolutive case is unmarked, while the Relative case is marked by the prefix /t-/.
   - The Absolutive case is used for the subject and direct object of a transitive verb.
   - The Relative case is used for other relata.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - This paragraph primarily discusses substitutes and does not introduce any new case forms beyond those already mentioned (Absolutive and Relative).

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The text reiterates the use of the Absolutive case for subjects and direct objects and the Relative case for other relata.
   - It also mentions the use of the Relative case for secondary relata and the initiator of an action expressed by a passive verb.

From the information provided, Squamish has a clear distinction between two productive case forms: Absolutive and Relative. There is no indication of additional cases beyond these two.

**Reasoning**:
- The Absolutive case is used for subjects and direct objects, which are core grammatical relations.
- The Relative case is used for other grammatical relations, including secondary relata and the initiator in passive constructions.
- No other cases are mentioned or implied in the provided text.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **General Remarks on Noun Inflection (4.81)**:
   - The determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

2. **Detailed Description of Cases**:
   - **Definitive Case**: Requires the use of gender-number suffixes.
   - **Non-Definitive Case**: No inflectional suffixes and can be singular or plural depending on context.
   - **Locative Case**: Expressed by one of three locative suffixes and can be singular or plural depending on context.

3. **Locative Suffixes (4.85)**:
   - Three locative suffixes are mentioned: -s, -stihki, and -hta, each with specific meanings and usage.

4. **Syntactic Functions (10.11)**:
   - The syntactic functions of these cases are described, showing how they are used in sentences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Tunica has three productive case paradigms for nouns: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative. Therefore, the number of cases in Tunica is:

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Washo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses various prefixes related to person and their syntactic expansions. These prefixes are used to indicate subjects, objects, and possessors, but there is no mention of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves. The prefixes seem to function more like pronominal affixes rather than case markers.

2. **Paragraph 2** details the inflection of pronouns for person, number, and inclusiveness. Again, there is no indication of morphological case-marking on nouns. The pronouns are inflected for different grammatical roles, but this does not constitute a case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3** describes the derivation of adverbs from nouns, pronouns, and quantitatives using postpositions. These postpositions (e.g., Instrumental, Locative, Comitative) are added to fully inflected nouns and pronouns. This suggests that Washo uses postpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. However, these postpositions do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns themselves.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the subordination of finite verbs and the formation of nominalized and adverbialized predications. The use of suffixes to form nominalized predications (e.g., subjective and objective nominalization) does not indicate a case system but rather a process of creating noun-like forms from verbs.

From the analysis, it is clear that Washo does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses pronominal prefixes and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships. The presence of postpositions for specific semantic roles (like Instrumental, Locative, Comitative) aligns with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wichita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wichita, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking:

1. **Instrumental Case**: The text mentions an instrumental suffix used to indicate the instrument or means by which an action is performed. Examples include:
   - ""ha:ritwitc&:nir"" (using a bowl)
   - ""ika:rfthir"" (with a rock)
   - ""kKirthirtitsithir"" (in Wichita)

2. **Locative Case**: There is a locative suffix used to indicate location. Examples include:
   - ""ikeatkfyah"" (where the rock is)
   - ""tihesha"" (it is a rock)
   - ""nshe:hfirih"" (where the creek is)

3. **Definite Article**: The text mentions a definite article suffix, which is used to mark definiteness in nouns.

4. **Combining Forms**: The text describes combining forms of nouns, which are used in compound words or incorporated into verbs. These forms may involve changes to the base noun but do not necessarily indicate a separate case system.

5. **Summary of Noun Suffixes**: The summary lists various suffixes, including:
   - ""-hir’a"" (locative)
   - ""-kta"" (nominal)
   - ""-R&:hir"" (instrumental)
   - ""-reveR"" (definite article)
   - ""-s"" (nominal)

From the above observations, it is clear that Wichita has specific suffixes for locative and instrumental functions. However, there is no mention of a broader, productive case system that includes nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc. The presence of locative and instrumental suffixes suggests that Wichita employs case marking for specific semantic roles rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wintu, we can determine the number of cases in the language by analyzing the case-marking system described.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The pronominal system in Wintu distinguishes six cases: subject, object, dependent possessive, independent possessive, instrumental, and locative.
   - These cases are marked by specific suffixes: 
     - Object case suffix {um}
     - Pronominal possessive case suffix {t}
     - Instrumental case suffix {r}
     - Locative case suffix {in}

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - The locative case is mentioned multiple times, indicating its productive use in the language.
   - The genitive case is also mentioned, specifically in the context of nouns (e.g., ""particular genitive case"" and ""generic genitive case"").

### Reasoning:
From the information provided, Wintu has a clear and productive case-marking system for nouns and pronouns. The cases identified include:
- Subject
- Object
- Dependent Possessive
- Independent Possessive
- Instrumental
- Locative
- Genitive

This gives us a total of seven distinct cases. Given that the genitive case is explicitly mentioned and used productively, it should be included in the count.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",4 cases,6-7 cases
Acoma,,no morphological case-marking,
Aleut,"### Conclusion: 2 cases

### Reasoning:
Based on the provided descriptive grammar of Aleut, the language exhibits two productive case paradigms for nouns: the absolutive and the relative.

1. **Absolutive Case**: This case is used primarily for the subject, predicate, or object of a sentence. Examples include:
   - Singular: `tayagu-%` (man-sg.abs.)
   - Dual: `tayagu-kux`
   - Plural: `tayagu-n`

2. **Relative Case**: This case is used for possessive constructions and other relational functions. Examples include:
   - Singular: `tayagu-m` (man-sg.rel.)
   - Dual: `tayagu-kin`
   - Plural: `tayagu-ngin`

The grammar does not provide evidence of additional productive cases beyond these two. The descriptions of noun inflections and their uses consistently refer to these two cases, and there is no mention of other cases such as dative, instrumental, or locative being part of a productive case system for nouns. The locative and ablative forms mentioned are used with positional nouns and demonstratives, but they do not form part of a broader case system for all nouns.

Therefore, Aleut has a system of two productive cases: the absolutive and the relative.",2 cases,2 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),,no morphological case-marking,
Comanche,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Comanche, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Absolutive Case**:
   - The absolutive suffixes `-pi`, `-pih`, and their variations are used to mark the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs. Examples include `tsuku-pi` (corn-ABS), `hani-pi` (corn-ABS), and `foya-pi` (blood-ABS).

2. **Objective Case**:
   - The objective case is marked by several suffixes such as `-i`, `-a`, `-ha`, `-e`, and `-ta`. These suffixes are used to mark the direct object of a verb. Examples include `puku-i` (horse-OBJ), `kahni-a` (house-OBJ), and `ubka nii tsuku-pi-a` (I saw the crazy man).

3. **Possessive Case**:
   - The possessive case is marked by suffixes such as `-na`, `-ha`, and `-ti`. These suffixes indicate possession. Examples include `tsuku-pi-a pimoted` (old man's cow) and `anikata-a kahni` (ant’s house).

4. **Locative Postpositions**:
   - Comanche uses a variety of locative postpositions that are suffixed to nouns, such as `-pa?a` (on, above, over), `-ku=pa` (in), `-tuhka` (under), and `-H/ku` (to, toward). These postpositions indicate spatial relationships but are not considered core grammatical cases.

5. **Instrumental and Comitative Postpositions**:
   - The language also uses postpositions like `-max` (with an instrument) and `-ma7aix` (with, comitative) to indicate the means or accompaniment in an action. These are more peripheral and do not constitute core grammatical cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the grammar, Comanche has a system with three core grammatical cases: **absolutive**, **objective**, and **possessive**. The locative and instrumental postpositions are not counted as core cases but rather as peripheral markers.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",3 cases,3 cases
Kiowa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kiowa, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses pronouns, adjectives, and possessive constructions but does not provide explicit information about case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Focuses on indefinite and interrogative forms, derivation, and adverbials, but again does not mention case marking on nouns.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Describes adverbials, deictics, and locative expressions, but does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions locative/directional adverbials and noun-instrumental constructions, but these are more about locative expressions and instrumental uses rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Kiowa. The language seems to use locative and instrumental markers, but these do not constitute a full case system as defined in the guidelines. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Kiowa is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Absolutive Case**: This is used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs. It is also the citation form for nouns.
2. **Ablative-Modalis Case**: This case is used for indefinite objects, places from which motion occurs, and specification. It is marked by the suffix ~%mek in the singular and ~%nek in the plural.
3. **Terminalis Case**: This case indicates the place to which motion occurs. It is marked by the suffix ~%mun in the singular and ~%nun in the plural.
4. **Localis Case**: This case indicates the place at which something occurs. It is marked by the suffix ~%mi in the singular and ~%ni in the plural.
5. **Relative Case**: This case is used to indicate possession and the subject of transitive verbs. It is marked by the suffix %:(e)m in the singular, %:(e)t in the plural, and %:(e)k in the dual.
6. **Vialis Case**: This case indicates the route or means by which an action is performed. It is marked by the suffix %kun in the singular and %tgun in the plural.
7. **Equalis Case**: This case indicates similarity or comparison. It is marked by the suffix %tun in the singular and %cetun in the plural.

From the paragraphs, we can see that Yup'ik has at least seven distinct cases: Absolutive, Ablative-Modalis, Terminalis, Localis, Relative, Vialis, and Equalis. These cases are used productively to mark various syntactic and semantic relationships.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Personal Pronouns**:
   - The personal pronouns have distinct forms for subjects and objects, such as ""nek"" (I) and ""nekac"" (me), ""ke?1"" (you) and ""kelac"" (you - object form). This indicates a nominative-accusative distinction in pronouns.
   - There are also comitative forms like ""neka?ai"" (with me) and ""kela?at"" (with you), and locative forms like ""neka‘noi"" (with us), ""kelewnoi"" (with you - plural), and ""wek"" (to him/her/it).

2. **Nouns**:
   - Nouns are generally invariable, meaning they do not change form based on case. However, there are locative forms created by adding suffixes like ""-ot"" or ""-ik"" to nouns, indicating location (e.g., ""cpega?r"" (ear) becomes ""cpega?rot"" (in the ear), ""ho:let"" (garden) becomes ""ho-letik"" (in the garden)).
   - There are also irregular locative forms and suffixes that can be added to indicate specific locative meanings.

### Reasoning:

- **Personal Pronouns**: The presence of distinct forms for subjects and objects (nominative and accusative) in personal pronouns suggests a minimal case system for pronouns.
- **Nouns**: The primary case marking observed for nouns is locative, which is used to indicate location. There is no evidence of a broader case system for other syntactic roles (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive) in nouns.

Given the information, Yurok exhibits case marking primarily in personal pronouns and locative marking in nouns. The locative marking is a concrete or peripheral case relation, and there is no extensive case system for other syntactic roles in nouns.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the Zuni grammar, we can determine the number of cases in the Zuni language by examining the morphological case-marking on nouns.

1. **Personal Pronouns**: The text mentions that Zuni has personal pronouns differentiated for case (subject, object, possessive). This indicates that there is a system of case-marking for pronouns, but it does not directly inform us about the case-marking on nouns.

2. **Enclitics and Locative Marking**: The text describes various enclitics such as -an (locative), -kwin (directional), and -te (adversative). These enclitics are used to mark locative and directional relations, which are typically considered peripheral or semantic cases.

3. **Noun Compounds and Suffixation**: The text provides examples of noun compounds and suffixation but does not explicitly mention case-marking suffixes for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive.

4. **Inessive Enclitic**: The mention of the inessive enclitic (-?annan, -annan, -nan) suggests a specific locative case, which is another peripheral case.

From the information provided, it appears that Zuni uses enclitics to mark locative and directional relations, which are concrete or peripheral case relations. There is no explicit mention of a full paradigm of core grammatical cases (such as nominative, accusative, dative, genitive) for nouns.

**Reasoning**: The evidence points towards the presence of case-marking for specific semantic relations (locative, directional) rather than a comprehensive system of core grammatical cases. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin), we can identify the following:

1. **Oblique Marking**: The language uses an oblique marker ""t"" to indicate noun phrases that are not direct arguments in the clause. These oblique noun phrases can represent various roles such as instruments, themes, and factitives (Paragraph 2).

2. **Locative Prepositions**: There is a set of locative prepositions (k’] ‘to, into’, | ‘in, at, on’, tl’ ‘from’, tu ‘from’) used to mark adjunct arguments of location (Paragraph 2).

3. **Genitive Marking**: Genitive constructions are marked by the same free morpheme used for locative marking (| ‘in, at, on’). Genitive marking is optional and can appear in various positions relative to the possessor and possessum (Paragraph 2).

4. **Ergative Marking**: Ergative arguments (3rd person transitive subjects) can sometimes be marked oblique, indicating a type of quirky case-marking (Paragraph 2).

5. **Applicative Constructions**: In applicative constructions, the theme argument is marked oblique, while the goal/benefactive/malefactive argument appears as a direct object (Paragraph 3).

From these observations, it is clear that Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin) employs specific markers for oblique and locative cases, and has a genitive marker. However, there is no evidence of a full-fledged case system with multiple distinct cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the language appears to use markers for specific semantic roles and locations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tlingit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tlingit, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Nominal Phrase Functions**:
   - The nominal phrase in Tlingit functions as subject, object, indirect object, and extension.
   - There is mention of agreement with pronominal prefixes in the verb for subjects and objects, but not for indirect objects or extensions.
   - The subject may be optionally followed by the syntactic marker -j, and the instrumental syntactic marker -j is used for adverbial phrases.

2. **Syntactic Markers**:
   - Tlingit uses various syntactic markers (e.g., -d, -de, -AX, -X, -u) which are clitics and function to mark situational, adjunctival, complemental, subjectival, and locative relations.
   - These markers are used to define the function of elements within the clause or phrase.

3. **Locative and Adverbial Phrases**:
   - Locative phrases are defined by their obligatory co-occurrence with situational syntactic markers.
   - Adverbial phrases, including locational, adjunctival, complemental, temporal, and modal, are marked by specific syntactic markers.

4. **Pronominal and Possessive Marking**:
   - Pronominals function as object, possessive, and adverbial elements within phrases.
   - Possessive pronominals are used in nominal, locative, and adverbial phrases.

5. **Examples of Case-like Marking**:
   - The use of markers such as -de (allative), -d (illative), -AX (ablative), -X (translative), and -u (adessive) indicates specific locative and directional relations.
   - These markers are used to indicate relationships such as direction, location, and possession.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

**Reasoning**: Tlingit does not exhibit a full-fledged case system with distinct morphological cases for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, it uses a set of syntactic markers that primarily indicate locative and directional relations, which are considered peripheral or semantic cases. These markers do not form a comprehensive case paradigm for nouns but rather serve specific adverbial and locative functions, fitting the definition of ""exclusively borderline case-marking.""",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking:

1. **Obviative and Proximate Distinction**:
   - The language makes a distinction between proximate and obviative forms, which is a common feature in Algonquian languages. This distinction is used to mark the focus of attention and more remote entities in discourse. For example, ""nil n·koselom·a wasis"" (I love the child (proximate)) vs. ""Mali '·koselom·a·l wasfs·ol"" (Mary (proximate) loves the child (obviative)).

2. **Possessive Forms**:
   - The language has specific possessive forms for nouns, which include additional marking for the obviative in third-person forms. Examples include ""ntulol"" (my boats) and ""ktulol"" (your boats).

3. **Locative Inflection**:
   - There are locative forms for nouns, which are marked with suffixes such as ""-ok"" for singular and ""-ihkuk"" for plural. Examples include ""wikuwamok"" (in, on, at the house) and ""sqotek"" (in the fire).

4. **Absentative Forms**:
   - Nouns and demonstrative pronouns have absentative forms, indicating absence in time or space. Examples include ""Piyel mfhtaqsokol"" (Peter's late father) and ""nil nmulcessokk"" (my lost mittens).

5. **Diminutive and Feminine Suffixes**:
   - The language uses diminutive and feminine suffixes to modify nouns. Examples include ""mahtoqehsis"" (little hare) and ""sakomask"" (female chief).

6. **Vocative Forms**:
   - Some nouns have vocative forms used for direct address. Examples include ""tus"" (daughter) and ""q6ss"" (son).

7. **Demonstrative Pronouns**:
   - The language has demonstrative pronouns with animate and inanimate forms, as well as absentative forms. Examples include ""wot"" (this, animate) and ""yilt"" (this, inanimate).

### Conclusion:
The evidence from the descriptive grammar indicates that Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has overt marking for specific syntactic and semantic relations, such as obviative, proximate, possessive, locative, and absentative forms. However, these forms are more aligned with concrete or peripheral case relations rather than a full-fledged case system that marks core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or dative.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tsimshian (Coast), we can observe the following:

1. **Basic Sentence Structure and Case Marking**:
   - Tsimshian employs an ergative-absolutive alignment.
   - The ergative case marks the subject of transitive verbs.
   - The absolutive case marks the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.

2. **Morphological Marking**:
   - The ergative case is marked with enclitics such as -a or -t.
   - The absolutive case can be marked with enclitics like -as/-s for proper nouns in intransitive sentences and -at/-t for proper nouns in transitive sentences.
   - There are also pronominal forms for ergative and absolutive cases, indicating a productive system of case marking.

3. **Additional Observations**:
   - The grammar mentions the use of enclitics and pronominals to mark cases, which suggests a systematic and productive morphological case-marking paradigm.
   - There is no mention of additional cases beyond ergative and absolutive, such as dative, genitive, or instrumental, within the provided text.

Given these observations, Tsimshian (Coast) appears to have a productive case system with two primary cases: ergative and absolutive.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tetelcingo Nahuatl, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Absolutive Case:**
   - The absolutive suffixes (-tl, -t, -tli) are mentioned as markers that appear on nouns in their base form. This suffix is dropped when the noun is possessed, pluralized, compounded, or followed by a postposition.
   - Examples: 
     - kak-tle (sandal-ABS)
     - tlol-e (earth-ABS)
     - kene&-1 (mouse-ABS)

2. **Possession:**
   - Possession is indicated by prefixes (e.g., no- for ""my"", i- for ""his/her/its""). The absolutive suffix is dropped in possessed forms.
   - Examples:
     - no-tlol (my land)
     - i-kie (her skirt)

3. **Pluralization:**
   - Plural forms are marked by suffixes -me or -te, which replace the absolutive suffix.
   - Examples:
     - kak-me (sandals)
     - kene&-te (mice)

4. **Postpositions:**
   - Postpositions are used to indicate locative and other relational meanings. They are mostly bound and occur postposed to possessive pronouns or directly to nouns.
   - Examples:
     - tlol-pa (on the ground)
     - i-yul-ipa (in his heart)

### Conclusion:

The analysis shows that Tetelcingo Nahuatl uses an absolutive suffix to mark the base form of nouns, which is dropped in various grammatical contexts such as possession, pluralization, and compounding. The language also employs postpositions to indicate locative and other relational meanings. However, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm beyond the absolutive and the use of postpositions.

Given the information, Tetelcingo Nahuatl does not exhibit a productive case system with multiple distinct cases. Instead, it relies on the absolutive suffix and postpositions for relational meanings.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abkhaz, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Absence of Case-Marking**: The text mentions the ""absence of case-marking"" explicitly, indicating that nouns in Abkhaz do not inflect for case in the traditional sense. Instead, syntactic functions are marked by pronominal affixes within the verbal complex.

2. **Pronominal Affixes**: The description highlights the use of pronominal affixes to indicate syntactic roles such as subjects of intransitive verbs, direct objects of transitive verbs, and indirect objects. These affixes are bound to the verb and not to the noun, which is a characteristic of head-marking languages rather than dependent-marking languages that use case.

3. **Possessive Relationships**: Possessive relationships are marked by possessive prefixes on nouns, rather than by genitive case endings.

4. **Reflexive and Reciprocal Marking**: Reflexive and reciprocal actions are marked within the verbal complex using specific affixes, rather than through case inflection on nouns.

Given these points, it is clear that Abkhaz does not employ a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on pronominal affixes and other verbal morphology to indicate grammatical relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Eastern Armenian, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative (NOM)**: Zero ending (unmarked).
2. **Dative (DAT)**: Ends in various suffixes such as {-i}, {-u}, {-an}, {-a}, {-o}, {-oj}, {-va}, or {-c}.
3. **Ablative (ABL)**: Ends in {-ic}.
4. **Instrumental (INST)**: Ends in {-ov}.
5. **Locative (LOC)**: Ends in {-um}.

These cases are used productively across different syntactic and semantic functions, as detailed in the grammar. The genitive case is also mentioned in the context of possessive pronouns and their use with prepositions and postpositions, which indicates its productive use as well.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Basque,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can determine the number of cases in the language. The paragraphs describe a systematic and productive case-marking system with multiple distinct case suffixes applied to noun phrases. Here are the key points:

1. **Case and Number Inflection**: The text clearly states that case and number inflection in Basque is marked by suffixes attached to the last word of the noun phrase, which can be a noun, adjective, or another modifier.
2. **Uniform Inflectional Endings**: The inflectional endings for case and number are uniform across all nouns and adjectives, with some morphophonological variations depending on the stem ending (vowel or consonant).
3. **Inflectional Paradigms**: The tables provided (Tables 59 and 60) list a comprehensive set of inflectional forms for the words ""leku"" (place) and ""hondartza"" (beach). These tables include multiple distinct case forms.

From the tables, we can identify the following cases:
- Absolutive (ABS)
- Ergative (ERG)
- Dative (DAT)
- Genitive (GEN)
- Benefactive (BEN)
- Comitative (COM)
- Instrumental (INSTR)
- Partitive (PRTT)
- Prolative (PRO)
- Locative (LOC)
- Ablative (ABL)
- Allative (ALL)
- Directive (DIR)
- Terminative (TERM)
- Relative (REL)

This gives us a total of 15 distinct cases.

**Reasoning**: The detailed paradigms and the number of distinct case forms listed in the tables indicate that Basque has a highly developed and productive case system with more than ten cases.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Catalan, the following observations can be made:

1. The discussion primarily revolves around personal pronouns, their forms, and their usage in various syntactic contexts.
2. There is no mention of a productive case system for nouns. Instead, the language relies on prepositions and pronouns to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.
3. The examples provided show that Catalan uses prepositions (e.g., ""per"", ""amb"", ""segons"") to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.
4. The pronouns do not exhibit distinct case forms beyond what is typical for subject, object, and possessive pronouns, similar to English.

Given these points, it is clear that Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it uses prepositions and pronouns to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Frisian (Western) descriptive grammar, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Pronouns and Case Forms**:
   - The pronouns section (4.1.4) lists separate forms for subject (e.g., ""ik"" for 'I', ""do"" for 'you', ""hy"" for 'he') and object (e.g., ""my"" for 'me', ""dy"" for 'you', ""him"" for 'him'). This indicates a distinction between nominative and accusative cases for pronouns.
   - The possessive forms (e.g., ""my"" for 'my', ""dy"" for 'your', ""syn"" for 'his') suggest a genitive case.

2. **Indefinite Pronouns**:
   - The indefinite pronouns section (4.1.4.3) shows forms like ""men"" (subjective), ""jin"" (objective), and ""jins"" (possessive), reinforcing the presence of nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.

3. **Reflexive Pronouns**:
   - Reflexive pronouns use the object forms of personal pronouns (e.g., ""my"" for 'myself', ""har"" for 'herself'), which aligns with the accusative case usage.

4. **Relative Pronouns**:
   - The relative pronouns section (4.1.4.6) does not introduce new case forms but uses existing pronouns in relative clauses.

5. **General Observations**:
   - The grammar does not mention additional cases like dative, instrumental, locative, etc., for nouns.
   - The primary distinctions are nominative (subject), accusative (object), and genitive (possessive).

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the grammar, Frisian (Western) has a productive case system with three cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Hunzib,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hunzib, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: This is the default case used for the subject of a sentence. It is mentioned explicitly in the text.
2. **Ergative**: Used to mark the agent of a transitive verb. The ergative ending is -l after a vowel or -lo after a consonant.
3. **Genitive**: Used to indicate possession. The genitive ending is -s.
4. **Instrumental**: Used to denote the means by which an action is performed. The instrumental ending is -d.
5. **Dative**: Used to indicate the indirect object of a verb. The dative ending is a copy vowel.
6. **Adessive**: Indicates location or proximity. The adessive ending is -g(o).
7. **Superessive**: Indicates position on top of something. The superessive ending is -X(o).
8. **Subessive**: Indicates position under something. The subessive ending is -k.
9. **Comitative**: Indicates accompaniment. The comitative ending is -gur.
10. **Allative**: Indicates movement towards something. The allative ending is -dar.
11. **Elative**: Indicates movement out of something. The elative ending is -s(a).
12. **Translative**: Indicates movement through something. The translative ending is -X(i).

These cases are productive and form a comprehensive system of morphological case-marking in Hunzib. The presence of these multiple cases indicates a rich inflectional system.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayah Li (Eastern),,no morphological case-marking,
Khanty,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Khanty, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns as follows:

1. **Nominal Morphology**:
   - Nouns in Khanty inflect for number, case, and possession.
   - The order of inflectional morphemes is: stem-(number)-(possession)-(case).

2. **Case System**:
   - The case system includes:
     - **Nominative**: Unmarked.
     - **Locative**: Marked by -na.
     - **Translative**: Marked by -ji after a vowel and -Ci after a consonant-final stem, where C assimilates to the stem-final consonant.

3. **Examples and Functions**:
   - The Locative case is used for various functions such as indicating place, direction, passive agent, patient argument in certain constructions, adjunct indicating point in time, measure, instrument or means, distributive, and indirect object of some verbs.
   - The Translative case is used for secondary predicates, result or final point of movement, verbal action, and main predicate with the copula ji- ‘become’.

4. **Personal Pronouns**:
   - Personal pronouns have a morphologically marked Accusative-Dative case, which encodes direct object, indirect object, and experiencer in experiential constructions.
   - The Locative case for personal pronouns is formed from the Accusative-Dative with the affix -na.

5. **Postpositions**:
   - Postpositions in Khanty can take agreement affixes identical to the personal affixes of nouns, indicating a relationship with nominal inflection.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Khanty has a productive case system with three distinct cases: Nominative, Locative, and Translative. Therefore, the number of cases in Khanty is:

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",3 cases,3 cases
Korean,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean detail the case-marking system of the language. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

1. **Types of Cases**:
   - **Syntactic Cases**: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive.
   - **Semantic Cases**: Dative, Goal, Locative (Static and Dynamic), Source, Directional, Instrumental, Function, Ablative, Comitative, Connective, Comparative.

2. **Case Particles**:
   - **Nominative**: ka/i
   - **Accusative**: (u)l
   - **Genitive**: uy
   - **Dative**: eykey, hanthey, kkey
   - **Static Locative**: ey
   - **Dynamic Locative**: eyse
   - **Source**: eyse
   - **Goal**: ey, eykey, hanthey, kkey
   - **Directional**: (u)lo
   - **Instrumental**: (u)lo(sse)
   - **Function**: (u)lo(se)
   - **Ablative**: puthe, (u)lo puthe, eyse puthe, kkeyse puthe
   - **Comitative**: wa/kwa, hako, (i)lang
   - **Connective**: wa/kwa, (i)na
   - **Comparative**: pota, mankhum, chelem, kathi

3. **Case Functions**:
   - **Nominative**: Subject of a predicate, object of a transitive adjective, complement of the copula, sentential subject.
   - **Accusative**: Direct object of a transitive verb, direct object of a passive-transitive verb, purpose of an action, duration or distance of an action, object of a cognate verb, objects in multiple object constructions, clausal object construction.
   - **Genitive**: Possession, relationship, authorship, classification, pertinence, origin, location, reference, argument and predicate relations.
   - **Dative**: Indirect object of a dative verb, goal of a locomotive verb.
   - **Locative**: Static (location of time, age, proportion, reference, agent, cause, addition), Dynamic (activity verbs, source with movement verbs).
   - **Source**: Origin of a theme.
   - **Goal**: Movement verbs, non-dative transitive verbs.
   - **Directional**: Towards, to, for.
   - **Instrumental**: With, of, by, in.
   - **Function**: As, for, in the capacity of, in terms of.
   - **Ablative**: From, starting from, starting with.
   - **Comitative**: Connecting two nominals, reciprocal verbs.
   - **Connective**: Coordinating meaning of 'and' or 'or'.
   - **Comparative**: More/less than, as much as, like, the same as.

4. **Case Particle Stacking**:
   - Korean allows for case particle stacking, where multiple case particles can be associated with the same nominal. However, only one of these particles performs an active case function in a given sentence, termed the ""privileged"" case, while others are ""privative"" and contribute semantic content.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed description of the case-marking system in Korean, it is evident that Korean has a productive case system with a variety of syntactic and semantic cases. The total number of distinct cases described falls within the range of 10 or more cases.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Latvian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Latvian, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Traditional Case System**: The grammar traditionally recognizes seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative.

2. **Instrumental Case**: The status of the instrumental case is questioned. It is noted that the instrumental case is identical in form with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural, and it occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" (with). The grammar suggests that in modern Latvian, the instrumental case is not considered a separate case, and the preposition ""ar"" governs the accusative.

3. **Final Case Count**: After considering the arguments, the grammar concludes that modern Latvian has six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and vocative.

4. **Vocative Case**: The vocative is noted to be somewhat apart due to its function as a case of address and is not incorporated into the syntax of a sentence.

Given these points, the productive case paradigms of nouns in Latvian consist of six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and vocative. The instrumental case is not considered a separate productive case in modern Latvian.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, the language exhibits a highly complex case system. Here are the key points that lead to the conclusion:

1. **Number of Cases**: The grammar explicitly states that there are eighteen cases in Lezgian. These include four grammatical cases (Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, Dative) and fourteen local cases divided into five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In), each with three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive).

2. **Grammatical Cases**: The four grammatical cases are:
   - Absolutive
   - Ergative
   - Genitive
   - Dative

3. **Local Cases**: The fourteen local cases are derived from combinations of five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In) and three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive), with one combination missing (In-Directive).

4. **Case Formation**: The formation of these cases involves adding specific suffixes to the oblique stem of the noun. The oblique stem itself is formed through various suffixes depending on the noun's characteristics.

5. **Examples and Usage**: The grammar provides extensive examples of how these cases are used in sentences, demonstrating their productivity and regularity in marking syntactic and semantic relationships.

Given the detailed description and the explicit mention of eighteen cases, it is clear that Lezgian has a very large and productive case system.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases

Tati (Southern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Tati, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system described.

1. **General Remarks on Case (Paragraph 1)**:
   - Eshtehardi, a Southern Tati dialect, has a clear system of two cases: direct and oblique.
   - This system is extended to both genders and numbers.
   - Other Southern Tati dialects have weaker forms of this system, with some dialects distinguishing the oblique case only in the masculine singular.
   - The oblique case in -(a)r is used for nouns denoting family relatives and is extended to genitives and direct objects denoting a person in most dialects.

2. **Inflection of Nouns (Paragraph 2)**:
   - The singular direct case for masculine nouns is the plain form, while the oblique case adds an unstressed -e.
   - Feminine nouns generally do not change in the oblique case except in Eshtehardi, where the oblique singular ends in a stressed -a.
   - Plural forms also distinguish between direct and oblique cases, with specific endings for each dialect.

3. **Use of the Nominal Cases (Paragraph 3)**:
   - The direct case is used for subjects, vocatives, agents in most dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions.
   - The oblique case is used for genitives, agents in some dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions.

4. **Postpositions (Paragraph 4)**:
   - Postpositions are frequently used and can create case-like forms, but they are not true case endings as they appear after plural morphemes and pronominal suffixes.

5. **Personal Pronouns (Paragraph 5)**:
   - Personal pronouns have direct and oblique forms, with the oblique forms used for possessive pronouns, objects of verbs, and objects of postpositions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed descriptions provided, Southern Tati dialects, particularly Eshtehardi, exhibit a clear system of two productive cases: direct and oblique. This system is consistently applied across different genders and numbers, although with some variations in other dialects.

Turkish,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkish, we can determine the number of cases in Turkish as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that traditional Turkish grammarians recognize five cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, and ablative. Additionally, the genitive case is also recognized by some grammarians, making it a total of six cases. The suffixes for these cases are provided, and examples are given to illustrate their usage.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides a table of personal pronouns inflected for six cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and ablative. This reinforces the information from Paragraph 1 about the presence of these six cases.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the case markers for pronouns and nouns, confirming that the same six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and ablative) apply to both pronouns and nouns.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses reflexive pronouns and shows that they are also inflected for the same six cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and ablative.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses demonstrative pronouns and shows that they can be marked with all six case suffixes: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and ablative.

Urdu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urdu, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is the default case used for the subject of a sentence. Examples include ""larka"" (boy) and ""ghar"" (house).

2. **Oblique Case**: This case is used when a noun is followed by a postposition. The oblique case forms are derived from the nominative forms. For instance, ""larka"" (boy) becomes ""larké"" in the oblique case.

3. **Vocative Case**: This case is used for directly addressing someone or something. The vocative singular suffix is identical with the oblique suffix, and the vocative plural suffix is ""-o"". For example, ""larka"" (boy) becomes ""larké"" in the vocative case.

The grammar also mentions the use of postpositions such as ""né"" (ergative), ""kó"" (dative), ""sé"" (ablative/instrumental), ""méth"" (locative), and ""par"" (locative). However, these are not considered separate cases in the traditional sense but rather postpositional phrases that require the noun to be in the oblique case.

### Conclusion:
**3 cases**

Urdu has three productive cases for nouns: nominative, oblique, and vocative.",2 cases,3 cases
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can identify several productive case paradigms for nouns. Here is a summary of the cases mentioned:

1. **Predicative Case**: Used for nominal predicates or the focus of a clause. It has variants -lek and -(e)k.
2. **Ablative Case**: Denotes movement away from a location, a person, or a temporal starting point. It also has metaphorical uses such as indicating cause, source of information, or part of a group.
3. **Prolative Case**: Signifies movement along, within, or through locations. It can also indicate the way information is transmitted, the reason for an event, or the part of the object directly acted upon.
4. **Attributive Form**: Used for expressing properties of the head-noun referent, such as material, nationality, species, or part-whole relationships.
5. **Possessive Attributive Form**: Marks possessive relations between the referent of a nominal modifier and a possessor outside the noun phrase.
6. **Privative Form**: Indicates the absence of something ('without X').
7. **Temporal Form**: Used with nouns denoting periods of time to create adverb-like temporal expressions.
8. **Prospective Form**: Indicates something that is going to be X.
9. **Proprietive Form**: Indicates possession or existence of something.
10. **Stative Form**: Indicates an acquirable and/or transient state of a person.

Apurinã,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The examples given primarily illustrate various markers that attach to noun bases, pronoun bases, and verb bases, such as the emphatic marker -putu, the gerund marker -inhi, the affectedness marker -nhi, and the perfectivity markers -pe and -panhi. These markers do not function as cases in the traditional sense of marking grammatical relationships between nouns and their heads. Instead, they modify the meaning of the nouns or verbs in other ways, such as indicating emphasis, affectedness, or aspect.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The markers discussed in the paragraphs (e.g., -putu, -inhi, -nhi, -pe, -panhi) do not correspond to grammatical cases like nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
   - These markers do not indicate syntactic relationships between nouns and verbs or other nouns, which is a core function of grammatical case.
   - The markers are more related to semantic modifications (e.g., emphasis, affectedness) and aspectual distinctions rather than syntactic roles.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awa Pit, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the productive case paradigms of nouns.

1. **Nominative-Accusative System**:
   - The language has a nominative-accusative case-marking system.
   - The subject of a sentence is unmarked, while the object (O) may be marked with the accusative marker ""ta"" if it is a referential human NP. Non-human NPs in the O function are generally unmarked.
   - There are special accusative forms for personal pronouns, indicating a distinction between nominative and accusative cases.

2. **Locative and Allative Markers**:
   - The language uses locative markers such as ""ta"" and ""pa"" (or its allomorph ""wa"") to indicate location and direction.
   - ""Mal"" is used to indicate a location within a larger location.
   - These locative markers are used to specify positions and movements, showing a productive system for marking locative relations.

3. **Possessive Marking**:
   - Possession is marked using the postposition ""pa"" (or ""wa"" after a vowel) for referential human noun phrases.
   - Possessive adjectives are used for personal pronouns, indicating a distinct possessive marking system.

4. **Instrumental and Comitative Marking**:
   - The postposition ""kasa"" is used to mark comitative (with animate NPs) and instrumental (with non-animate NPs) relations.

5. **Other Postpositions**:
   - Additional postpositions like ""akwa"" (because), ""patsa"" (like), and ""kana"" (semblative) are used to indicate various semantic relations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, Awa Pit has a productive case system that includes nominative, accusative, locative, allative, and possessive cases. The presence of these distinct markers indicates that the language has more than just a minimal case system.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",10 or more cases,4 cases
Barasano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barasano, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Case Markers**: The language has four morphemes that mark case:
   - **-re**: Marks objects, experiencers, benefactees, and manner.
   - **-réka**: Marks accompaniment and instrument.
   - **-h#**: Marks locations or times.
   - **-ya**: Marks the genitive.

Epena Pedee,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Epena Pedee, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Ergative Case**: Marked by the suffixes -pa and -a, depending on the noun or pronoun.
2. **Absolutive Case**: Generally unmarked, indicated by the absence of an overt case marker.
3. **Dative Case**: Marked by -mda, -md-a, -a, or vowel lengthening and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase.
4. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix -pa.
5. **Locative Case**: Marked by -de, -da, -ma, or -mai, depending on the noun type and context.
6. **Ablative Case**: Marked by -pa with vowel lengthening of the preceding vowel.

8. **Origin Case**: Marked by -péma or -péna.

These markers cover a range of syntactic and semantic relationships, including agent, patient, recipient, location, source, and direction, among others. Given this information, Epena Pedee has a productive case system with at least eight distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct morphological markers for ergative, absolutive, dative, instrumental, locative, ablative, allative, and origin cases.
- These markers are used productively across different noun phrases and pronouns.
- The presence of these multiple case markers indicates a robust case system.

**Conclusion**: 8-9 cases",10 or more cases,8-9 cases
Hixkaryana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hixkaryana, we can make the following observations regarding case marking:

1. **Postpositional Relators**: The text mentions that postpositional relators are used to express a wide range of syntactic and semantic functions, including locatives, manner, comparison, instrumental, agentive, comitative, benefactive, source, and time. This indicates that Hixkaryana uses postpositions to mark various relationships rather than inflectional case endings on nouns.

2. **Word Order**: The basic word order in Hixkaryana is object-verb-subject (OVS), and word order is significant for distinguishing subject and direct object. This suggests that syntactic roles are primarily indicated by word order rather than morphological case marking.

3. **Absence of Case Marking**: The text explicitly states that any syntactic relationship involving a noun phrase, other than subject and direct object, requires the use of a postpositional relator. This implies that there is no morphological case marking for subjects and direct objects, which are the core grammatical relations.

4. **Collective and Number Marking**: The discussion on collective markers and the optional nature of number marking further supports the idea that Hixkaryana does not rely on morphological case marking for grammatical relations but uses other means such as postpositions and word order.

Given these points, it is clear that Hixkaryana does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate various syntactic and semantic relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Paumarí,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, we can identify several case-marking strategies employed in the language:

1. **Ergative Case (-a 'ERG')**: This is used to mark the subject of a transitive verb when it occurs immediately before the verb and is not associated with a demonstrative (e.g., ""mamai-a"" in example 351).

2. **Accusative Case (-ra 'OBJ')**: This marks the direct object of a transitive verb when it occurs immediately before the verb and is not associated with a demonstrative (e.g., ""kahami-ra"" in example 353).

3. **Demoted Object Case (-a 'DEMOT:O')**: This marks a demoted object, which is typically the patient in a ditransitive clause (e.g., ""ihai-a"" in example 358).

4. **Oblique Case (-a 'OBL')**: This marks various oblique functions such as locative, temporal, instrumental, adjunct, and other adverbial phrases (e.g., ""kaasi-a"" in example 359).

From these observations, we can conclude that Paumarí has a productive case system with at least four distinct cases: Ergative, Accusative, Demoted Object, and Oblique.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",3 cases,4 cases
Pirahã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pirahã, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Oblique Case Marking**:
   - The suffix `-o` is used to mark locative or general oblique cases. This is evident from examples like ""ti xahoigi-o kahä-pi"" (I'm going in the evening) and ""kaii-o"" (in the house/at home).
   - The suffix `-hio`, `-oa`, and `-xai` are used to mark instrumental cases, as seen in examples like ""kahaixioi-hio"" (with a knife) and ""tagasag-oa"" (with a machete).

2. **Locative and Directional Suffixes**:
   - The suffix `-xio` is used to indicate direction, but it is noted that it cannot occur independently of `-o`. For instance, ""kaii-o-xio"" (to/going to the house).

3. **No Morphological Case for Core Arguments**:
   - The principal marker of grammatical relations is word order, not morphological case marking. This is explicitly stated in section 15.1: ""the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order.""

4. **Peripheral Constituents**:
   - The discussion on peripheral constituents and oblique objects indicates that these are marked morphologically, but core grammatical relations (like subject and direct object) are not marked by case affixes.

5. **Absence of Case Marking for Participants in Subordinate Clauses**:
   - It is mentioned that no affix marks participants or grammatical relations in subordinate clauses, reinforcing the idea that core grammatical relations are not marked by morphological cases.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The language Pirahã has morphological markers for peripheral or concrete case relations such as locatives and instrumentals, but it does not have a productive case paradigm for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Pirahã is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Shipibo-Konibo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Shipibo-Konibo, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Ergative-Absolutive System**: Shipibo-Konibo exhibits an ergative-absolutive case-marking system. The ergative case is marked overtly, while the absolutive case is marked by zero (no overt marking).

2. **Ergative Case**: The ergative morpheme {-n} has multiple allomorphs and is used to mark the ergative case, genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal functions.

3. **Genitive Case**: The genitive case is marked by the same morpheme as the ergative case.

4. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is also marked by the same morpheme as the ergative case.

5. **Locative-Directional and Temporal Cases**: These functions can be marked by the same morpheme as the ergative case, but there are alternative ways to mark locative-directional and temporal functions.

6. **Zero Marking**: Zero marking is used for recipients or goals, which implies that the absolutive case is unmarked.

From the above points, we can identify the following cases:
- **Ergative**: Marked by {-n} and its allomorphs.
- **Absolutive**: Unmarked (zero marking).
- **Genitive**: Marked by the same morpheme as the ergative.
- **Instrumental**: Marked by the same morpheme as the ergative.
- **Locative-Directional**: Marked by the same morpheme as the ergative, with alternative markers available.
- **Temporal**: Marked by the same morpheme as the ergative, with alternative markers available.

Given that the same morpheme is used for multiple functions, we need to consider whether these functions are distinct enough to be counted as separate cases. The genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal functions are typically considered distinct cases in linguistic typology.

### Conclusion:
**6-7 cases**

This conclusion is based on the identification of the ergative, absolutive, genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal cases, with the possibility of alternative markers for locative-directional and temporal functions.",6-7 cases,6-7 cases

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the following case markers:

1. **Ergative**: Marked by -ak / -ek / -k.
2. **Dative**: Marked by -atl / -etl / -tl, -ki, -as / -es / -s, -is, -os, -us.
3. **Locative**: Marked by -an / -en / -n.
4. **Genitive**: Marked by -kate / -kte.
5. **Absolutive**: No overt marking (marked as -Ø).

From this information, we can determine that Trumai has a productive case system with at least five distinct cases:

1. **Ergative**: Used to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
2. **Dative**: Used to mark the indirect object or the recipient.
3. **Locative**: Used to mark location.
4. **Genitive**: Used to mark possession.
5. **Absolutive**: Used to mark the subject of an intransitive verb or the direct object of a transitive verb (though it has no overt marking).

### Conclusion:
5 cases",5 cases,5 cases
Urubú-Kaapor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urubú-Kaapor, the following observations can be made regarding case marking:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph primarily discusses the word order in transitive and intransitive clauses, focusing on the syntactic structure rather than morphological case marking. There is no mention of multiple case markers for different syntactic roles.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph introduces the object marker ""ke"" and its usage in transitive clauses to indicate the object. It also mentions that ""ke"" can be used for focus or emphasis in various syntactic positions, but it does not introduce any additional case markers.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the use of ""ke"" as a potential case marker for objects in transitive clauses. It does not introduce any new case markers.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses possessive pronouns and reflexive pronouns, but it does not introduce any new case markers. It also mentions postpositions, which are not considered case markers in the context of this analysis.

From the information provided, it is clear that Urubú-Kaapor has a single productive case marker ""ke"" that is used to mark objects in transitive clauses. There is no evidence of additional morphological case markers for other syntactic roles.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can identify the following case markers:

1. **Dative (DAT)**: Expressed by suffixes -si, -ta, -ima, indicating beneficiaries and indirect objects.
2. **Locative (LOC)**: Expressed by suffixes -no, -te, indicating location.
3. **Allative (ALL)**: Expressed by suffix -ya, indicating movement towards a place.
4. **Ablative (ABL)**: Expressed by suffix -mo, indicating movement from a place.

These case markers are used to express various spatial and beneficiary relationships, which are typical of peripheral or semantic cases rather than core syntactic relations like nominative or accusative. The language does not exhibit overt case marking for subjects or direct objects, which are typically core syntactic cases.

Given the nature of the case markers identified, Warao fits the description of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it primarily marks peripheral or semantic relations such as locative, allative, ablative, and dative.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The examples and explanations focus primarily on verb morphology, agreement, and nominal modification, but do not provide evidence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

1. **Verb Agreement and Morphology**: The text discusses verb agreement with subjects and objects, indicating that person, number, and gender are marked on verbs. This suggests that syntactic relations are primarily indicated through verb morphology rather than noun case-marking.

2. **Nominal Modification**: The section on nominal modification describes how attributive modification is handled through possessive constructions and derived nouns, but it does not mention any case markers being used to indicate grammatical relations between nouns.

3. **Genitive Constructions**: The genitive morpheme is mentioned as a means of attributive modification, but this is not indicative of a broader case system. The genitive here functions more as a possessive marker rather than part of a larger case paradigm.

4. **Zero-Derivation**: The discussion on zero-derivation focuses on the derivation of verbs from sentences without affixation, which again does not pertain to noun case-marking.

Given the lack of evidence for a productive case system in the provided text, it is reasonable to conclude that Wari' does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the Yagua descriptive grammar offer detailed insights into the language's morphosyntactic structures, particularly focusing on clitics, pronouns, and postpositional phrases. However, the information relevant to determining the number of productive case paradigms for nouns is somewhat scattered and indirect. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Clitics and Pronouns**:
   - Yagua employs Set I and Set II clitics for various grammatical roles, including subjects, possessors, and objects of postpositions.
   - These clitics are phonologically bound to verbs, nouns, and postpositions, indicating their role in encoding grammatical relations.

2. **Postpositional Phrases**:
   - Yagua is a postpositional language with a variety of postpositions, some of which are more grammatical (e.g., adlative, ablative, dative, locative) and others more concrete.
   - The postpositions can be suffixed to nouns or occur as independent forms, often indicating spatial or relational semantics.

3. **Case-like Marking**:
   - The postpositions in Yagua function similarly to cases in other languages by marking relational roles such as location, direction, and possession.
   - Examples include:
     - **Adlative (-jy)**: indicating direction towards.
     - **Ablative (-siy)**: indicating direction away.
     - **Dative (-va/-iva)**: indicating the recipient or goal.
     - **Locative (-mu/-imu)**: indicating location.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The presence of these postpositions suggests that Yagua has a system of marking relational roles that could be considered akin to case marking.
   - However, these markers are more aligned with concrete or peripheral case relations rather than core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

Given the nature of the markers described, Yagua fits the category of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This is because the overt marking is primarily for concrete or semantic relations (locative, dative, ablative, etc.) rather than core syntactic functions.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Object Case (-a‡n)**: This marker is used for direct objects, beneficiaries, recipients, and other directly affected entities. It is subject to animacy and definiteness restrictions.
2. **Directional Oblique Case (-an)**: This marker is used for allative/ablative cases, relating to directional goals and sources, and can also express location.
3. **Oblique Case (-Vêt)**: This marker is used for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles. It is not dependent on animacy, definiteness, or number.

These markers indicate that Hup has a system of marking both core and oblique arguments with distinct morphological markers. The cases identified are:

- **Nominative** (unmarked for subjects)
- **Accusative** (object case -a‡n)
- **Instrumental/Comitative/Locative** (oblique case -Vêt)
- **Allative/Ablative** (directional oblique case -an)

Given these markers, Hup has a productive case system with at least four distinct cases:

1. **Nominative** (unmarked)
2. **Accusative** (-a‡n)
3. **Instrumental/Comitative/Locative** (-Vêt)
4. **Allative/Ablative** (-an)

### Conclusion:
4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Core Cases**:
   - **Nominative/Absolutive**: Zero-marked (Ø) for non-topical S and A arguments.
   - **Topical S/A**: Marked with the enclitic =dɨ.
   - **Accusative/Objective**: Zero-marked (Ø) for non-topical O arguments.
   - **Topical O**: Marked with -na.

2. **Oblique Cases**:
   - **Locative**: Marked with -mo.
   - **Ablative**: Marked with -mona.
   - **Instrumental**: Marked with -do.
   - **Benefactive-Causal**: Marked with -ri.
   - **Privative**: Marked with -(ni)no.

3. **Genitive**:
   - **Genitive**: Marked with -ɨe for 1st and 2nd person pronouns and with the connective ie for 3rd person pronouns.

The genitive is considered a case as it marks relations within the NP and does not encode categories of the possessum like number or gender, nor does it show explicit adjective-like properties.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has a clear system of marking core grammatical relations (S, A, O) and distinguishes between topical and non-topical arguments.
- There are five distinct oblique cases (locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative).
- The genitive case is included as it fits the criteria for being considered a grammatical case.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses word order, negation, coordination, and verbal morphology without indicating any morphological case-marking on nouns. The examples provided do not show any case suffixes or prefixes that would suggest the presence of a case system. Instead, grammatical relations seem to be indicated by word order and other syntactic means.

### Reasoning:
1. **Word Order**: The text emphasizes the importance of word order (SVO, SOV, etc.) in conveying grammatical relations, which is a common feature in languages without morphological case-marking.
2. **Negation and Coordination**: These sections discuss how negation and coordination are handled in Iquito, again without reference to any case markers on nouns.
3. **Verbal Morphology**: The detailed description of verbal morphology includes tense, aspect, and mood markers but does not mention any noun case markers.
4. **Examples**: The examples provided in the text show nouns in various syntactic positions but do not exhibit any morphological changes that would indicate case marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can determine the number of cases in the language. The relevant information is found in section (d):

> ""Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is absent.""

This indicates that Movima has a single oblique case marked by the prefix ""n-"" on certain referential elements, and no other case marking is present. Given that there is only one specific case marker and no other productive case paradigms for nouns, Movima falls under the category of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
- The language has a single oblique case marked by a prefix.
- No other case marking is present, indicating a lack of a broader case system.
- The presence of a single oblique case marker aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" which refers to languages with overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, we can analyze the presence and type of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1 (Nouns and Possession)**:
   - The discussion on possession indicates the use of person prefixes and a genitive postposition ""õ"" to mark possession. This suggests a genitive case for marking possessive relationships.
   - There is no mention of other syntactic cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc., in this context.

2. **Paragraph 2 (Non-canonical predicators)**:
   - The paragraph describes the use of the dative postposition to mark the sole participant in certain predications, indicating a dative case.
   - There is also mention of an ergative postposition used with certain verbs, indicating an ergative case.
   - The use of locative, instrumental, and inessive postpositions for marking arguments in various verb constructions suggests the presence of locative, instrumental, and inessive cases.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases:
- **Genitive**: Used for marking possession.
- **Dative**: Used for marking the sole participant in certain predications.
- **Ergative**: Used with certain verbs.
- **Locative**: Used for marking locations.
- **Instrumental**: Used for marking instruments.
- **Inessive**: Used for marking internal locations.

Given the presence of these cases, Apinayé appears to have a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: genitive, dative, ergative, locative, instrumental, and inessive.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Cacua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph introduces the concept of case markers in Kakua, specifying that there are enclitics for object case, locative case, and comitative/instrumental case. Examples are provided to illustrate these cases:
   - Object case: `=diʔ`
   - Locative case: `=bǔ`
   - Comitative/Instrumental case: `=hiʔ̃́`

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides a summary of the case markers in Kakua, reiterating the same three cases mentioned in Paragraph 1 and adding that terminative case is marked by a preposition `pɨ`. The table in this paragraph lists:
   - Object case: `=diʔ`
   - Locative case: `=bǔ`
   - Instrumental/Comitative case: `=hiʔ̃́`
   - Terminative case: `pɨ` (preposition)

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides examples and further details on the use of the instrumental/comitative case marker `=hiʔ̃́` and the terminative preposition `pɨ`.

From these paragraphs, we can conclude that Kakua has a system of case marking that includes:
- Object case
- Locative case
- Instrumental/Comitative case
- Terminative case (marked by a preposition)

Given that the terminative case is marked by a preposition, it does not count as a morphological case marker in the strictest sense. Therefore, Kakua has three productive morphological case markers for nouns.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has three distinct morphological case markers for object, locative, and instrumental/comitative functions.
- The terminative case is marked by a preposition and thus does not count as a morphological case marker for the purposes of this classification.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",4 cases,3 cases
Yuracare,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Vocative Plural Marker**: The vocative plural marker `-ypa` is mentioned, but vocative markers are not considered in the determination of case paradigms as they serve a pragmatic function rather than a syntactic one.

2. **Postpositional Clitics**: The language uses postpositional clitics to mark less central participants. The markers listed are:
   - `=tina` (comitative)
   - `=la` (instrument)
   - `=y` (locative)
   - `=chi` (direction)
   - `=jsha` (ablative)

   These markers are described as postpositions rather than case markers. According to the grammar, they are considered analytic rather than synthetic, and they attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase, indicating that they function more like adpositions than true case markers.

3. **Criteria for Case Marking**: According to the guidelines, true case marking involves synthetic markers that are morphosyntactically integrated into the noun phrase. The postpositional clitics in Yuracare do not meet this criterion as they are described as phrasal enclitics and are considered analytic.

Given this information, Yuracare does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses postpositional clitics to mark certain relations, which places it in the category of languages with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, the language exhibits a robust system of case marking through suffixes. Here is a detailed breakdown of the cases identified:

1. **Unmarked Case**: No overt marking for nominative and accusative (S, A, and O).
2. **Genitive**: Marked by the suffix -be.
3. **Benefactive**: Marked by -am for inanimate nouns and -bi-am for animate nouns.
4. **Instrumental**: Marked by -ak, with allomorphs -k and -ek.
5. **Comitative**: Marked by -abtak, often pronounced as /-aftak/.
6. **Locative**: Marked by -ok for inanimate nouns and -bi-ok for animate nouns.
7. **Allative**: Marked by -oy for inanimate nouns and -bi-oy for animate nouns.
8. **Ablative**: Marked by -okan for inanimate nouns and -bi-okan for animate nouns.
9. **Adessive**: Marked by -ents̈.
10. **Illative**: Marked by -iñ.

The grammar explicitly states that Camsá has nine cases, all of which are suffixes. These cases are used to mark various semantic and syntactic roles, such as possession, instrumentality, accompaniment, location, motion toward, motion from, and motion into.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraph, Kadiwéu appears to have a system of semantic role markers that are used with pronominal clitics and affixes rather than with nouns. The markers mentioned include:

- -d: ‘theme’
- -gi ‘goal’
- -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’
- -dom ~ -ma ~ -lo 'benefactive'
- -k 'allative'
- lokom 'adessive'

These markers are used to indicate various roles such as theme, goal, dative, benefactive, allative, and adessive. However, it is explicitly stated that these markers co-occur with pronominal clitics and affixes, not with nouns.

Given that the markers are not used directly with nouns but rather with pronominal elements, this does not constitute a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it suggests a system of semantic role marking that is more aligned with pronominal usage.

### Reasoning:
1. The markers are used with pronominal clitics and affixes, not with nouns.
2. The markers indicate semantic roles rather than syntactic relations directly on nouns.
3. The description fits the definition of ""exclusively borderline case-marking"" where the marking is for concrete or semantic relations and not for syntactic relations on nouns.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, the following observations can be made:

1. **Core NP Arguments**: The first paragraph explicitly states that core NP arguments, specifically the subject and direct object, are not morphologically marked. This indicates that there is no nominative or accusative case marking on nouns.

2. **Postpositions**: The second paragraph provides a list of postpositions in Karajá, including locative, ablative, instrumental, dative, allative, evitative, comitative, and comparative. These postpositions are used to mark various semantic roles and locations. However, these are not inflectional case markers but rather postpositions that attach to nouns to indicate their roles.

3. **Suppletive Forms**: The paragraph also mentions suppletive pronominal forms for the third person with certain postpositions, which suggests a complex system of pronominal forms but does not necessarily indicate a productive case system for nouns.

4. **Absence of Morphological Case Marking**: The description does not mention any inflectional case endings on nouns themselves. Instead, it relies on postpositions to convey relationships that might be expressed through case in other languages.

Given these points, it is clear that Karajá does not employ a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate relationships that would be marked by case in other languages.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Baure, it is clear that the language uses locative suffixes to mark locative arguments. The main kind of oblique argument is the locative NP marked by the locative suffix -ye. There is no mention of other case markers for core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or genitive. The locative marking is the only overt case marking discussed, and it is used for concrete locative relations.

Given this information, Baure appears to have ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it has overt marking only for locative relations and does not exhibit a full-fledged case system for core grammatical relations.

**Reasoning:**
- The locative suffix -ye is used to mark locative arguments.
- There is no mention of other productive case markers for core grammatical relations (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive).
- The marking of locative arguments aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
