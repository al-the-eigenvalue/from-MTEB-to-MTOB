Kayardild,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kayardild, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the various case markers and their functions.

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions that Kayardild has five types of functional domains for case: adnominal, relational, modal, associating, and complementizing. It also states that nominals may take up to four cases in a specific order: adnominal, relational, modal, and then complementizing or associating.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides a detailed overview of the basic semantic values of each case in Kayardild. It lists several cases including locative, ablative, allative, oblique, proprietive, genitive, origin, and privative, among others. This indicates a rich case system with multiple distinct cases.

3. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of nominal suffixes that are formally identical with case markers to indicate tense, aspect, and mood on non-subject NPs. It mentions specific cases such as locative, ablative, and proprietive, used in modal functions.

4. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph illustrates the accumulation of multiple layers of case marking on nouns, showing that a noun can take up to four levels of case inflection.

5. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the adnominal function of case inflections and provides examples of cases such as genitive, ablative, and proprietive, used to mark possessors and other relationships.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions that all other case suffixes are added to the possessive pronoun stem, indicating a productive and extensive case system.

7. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the modal case system and its correlation with verb inflections for tense, mood, and aspect. It highlights the complexity and richness of the case system in Kayardild.

8. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph mentions the extent of agreement in Kayardild, where case percolates down indefinitely from higher to lower constituents, resulting in deeply embedded nominals accumulating up to four case suffixes.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Kayardild has a highly complex and productive case system with multiple distinct cases. The language exhibits a rich array of cases used for various syntactic and semantic functions, including locative, ablative, allative, oblique, proprietive, genitive, origin, privative, and others.

### Conclusion:
**10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Malakmalak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can infer the following about the case system in Malakmalak:

1. **Paragraph 19** lists several affixes that can be attached to nouns, which include:
   - Possessor suffix
   - Benefactive suffix
   - Intentive suffix
   - Relator suffix
   - Comitative suffix
   - Locative suffix
   - Agentive suffix
   - Proprietive affix
   - Resemblance suffix
   - Quantifying suffix
   - Dubitative suffix

2. **Paragraph 11** mentions the functions of the suffix ""-no,"" which include:
   - Complement-marker
   - Benefactive
   - Possessor
   - Relator

3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss the presence of subject and object pronouns, but these are not directly relevant to the case marking on nouns.

From the information given, it is clear that Malakmalak has a variety of suffixes that mark different relationships and roles of nouns. These include locative, agentive, comitative, and others. The presence of these suffixes indicates that Malakmalak employs morphological case-marking.

Given the variety of suffixes listed, it appears that Malakmalak has a relatively large inventory of cases. However, not all of these suffixes may be considered productive cases in the strictest sense. For instance, some might be more derivational or specific to certain contexts.

Considering the range of suffixes provided and their functions, it is reasonable to classify Malakmalak as having ""6-7 cases."" This classification accounts for the primary syntactic and semantic roles marked by the suffixes.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mangarrayi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mangarrayi, the language exhibits the following case distinctions:

1. **Nominative**: Used for subjects, both transitive and intransitive.
2. **Accusative**: Used for direct objects.
3. **Dative**: Used for indirect objects and beneficiaries.
4. **Genitive**: Used to express possession.
5. **Instrumental**: Used to express the means by which an action is performed.
6. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.
7. **Allative**: Used to indicate movement towards a location.
8. **Ablative**: Used to indicate movement away from a location.
9. **Purposive**: Used to indicate the purpose or goal of an action.

The paragraphs indicate that Mangarrayi has a productive case system with distinct morphological markers for these functions. The presence of multiple locative-related cases (locative, allative, ablative) and the instrumental case, alongside core syntactic cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive), suggests a relatively rich case system.

### Reasoning:
- **Paragraph 1** mentions a full set of case forms for pronouns.
- **Paragraph 2** lists several case functions including dative, purposive, instrumental, locative, allative, genitive, and ablative.
- **Paragraph 3** confirms the presence of subject, object, dative, genitive, and local case forms.
- **Paragraph 6** discusses the instrumental case and its distinction from the ergative.
- **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 16** elaborate on the genitive, dative, and purposive cases, indicating their formal overlap but functional distinctions.
- **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 20** further support the presence of multiple locative-related cases and the genitive case.

Given the information, Mangarrayi has a case system with at least 10 distinct productive cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Maranungku,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maranungku, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The descriptions focus on noun modifiers, pronouns, verb structures, and other grammatical features, but there is no indication of morphological case-marking for syntactic or semantic relationships between nouns and their heads.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss noun modifiers, adjectives, demonstratives, numerals, and possessive adjectives, but do not mention any case markers.
   - The examples provided do not show any morphological changes to nouns that would indicate case marking.
   - The structure of sentences and the placement of nouns and pronouns are described without reference to case inflection.
   - The locative phrase example in Paragraph 9 suggests the use of prepositions rather than case marking to indicate location.

Given the absence of any evidence for morphological case-marking in the provided text, it is reasonable to conclude that Maranungku does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states: ""There is no case in Tiwi and the pronouns are used without inflexion in syntactic position -- e.g., as subject intransitive, subject transitive, object possessor."" This indicates that Tiwi does not use morphological case-marking for pronouns, and by extension, likely for nouns as well.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions a locative suffix `-ua`, but it is restricted to imperative verbs and cannot be assigned to a productive case paradigm for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 12** discuss the use of suffixes for gender and number but do not mention any case-marking suffixes.

4. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** elaborate on the morphophonological processes and nominal morphology, focusing on gender and number distinctions without indicating any case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** describe the formation of phrases and verb phrases, again without reference to any case-marking on nouns.

6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss sentence structure and the expression of syntactic relations, emphasizing the use of word order and context rather than morphological case-marking.

Given these points, it is clear that Tiwi does not employ a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language relies on other means, such as word order and context, to express syntactic relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ungarinjin, we can deduce the number of cases in the language by examining the evidence for productive case paradigms of nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions two distinct cases marked by ""ra,"" a locative and an instrumental agentive, which occur only on pronouns and proper nouns. This suggests that there are at least two cases in the language.

2. **Paragraph 3** indicates a distinction between grammatical and non-grammatical cases. Grammatical case relations are signaled by cross-reference on the verb, while non-grammatical cases are mainly signaled by nominal postpositions. This implies that there are specific markers for different case functions, but it does not provide a clear count of the number of cases.

3. **Paragraph 4** discusses a postposition ""-gu"" that serves some functions associated with the dative case in Indo-European languages. This suggests the presence of a dative case or a similar function.

4. **Paragraph 11** states that nominal postpositions in Ungarinjin do not normally indicate grammatical case relations, and noun phrases cross-referenced on the verb do not bear case postpositions. This implies that case marking might be limited or non-standard.

5. **Paragraph 18** describes the use of the postposition ""-gu"" in adverbial clauses, indicating that it functions as an adverbial case postposition.

6. **Paragraph 19** mentions the genitive postposition serving both possessive and local functions, indicating the presence of a genitive case.

From the information provided, it appears that Ungarinjin has a limited number of productive case markers, primarily for locative, instrumental, dative, and genitive functions. The evidence suggests that these cases are marked by postpositions rather than inflectional morphology on nouns.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is that Ungarinjin has ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as the overt marking is primarily for concrete or peripheral case relations such as locatives or instrumentals, and not for core grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wambaya,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, the language exhibits a productive case system with multiple distinct cases. Here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases:

1. **Core Cases**:
   - **Nominative**: Marked by a zero suffix (-0).
   - **Accusative**: Also marked by a zero suffix (-0).
   - **Ergative/Locative/Instrumental**: Marked by -yi, -ji, -ni, or -nu depending on the environment.

2. **Oblique Cases**:
   - **Dative**: Marked by -ja, -janka, -nka, or -ngga.
   - **Allative**: Marked by -nmanji.
   - **Ablative**: Marked by -ngani, -nnga, or -yili.
   - **Comitative**: Marked by -mbili or -yili.
   - **Perlative**: Marked by -nkanyi or -nmarndi.
   - **Causal**: Marked by -nigan.
   - **Genitive**: Marked by -nugan, -nagan, -uj, -nguj, or -aja.
   - **Proprietive**: Marked by -nguj or -aja.
   - **Privative**: Marked by -yaja, -waja, or -baja.
   - **Origin**: Marked by -in.

3. **Additional Information**:
   - The genitive suffixes are inflected for gender but are considered part of the productive case system.
   - The comitative case form serves as the base for other case forms such as the allative.
   - The language has a split-ergative system where free pronouns follow a nominative/accusative system, and other nominals follow an ergative/absolutive system.

Given the detailed case markers and their productive use in the language, Wambaya has a complex case system with more than ten distinct cases.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Amharic as follows:

1. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses possessive constructions and the use of possessive suffix pronouns. It shows that possession can be marked using the ""yǝ-"" structure or possessive suffixes attached to the possessed noun. This indicates a genitive-like construction but does not provide evidence of a broader case system.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Describes the verbal noun and its syntactic roles, including subject and direct object positions. The verbal noun can take possessive suffixes and the relative marker ""yǝ-"". This suggests some nominal inflection but does not confirm multiple distinct cases.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions the use of suffix pronouns with participles and adverbs, and the agreement of suffix pronouns with verbs. This indicates a system of marking possession and agreement but does not elaborate on a full case system.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the optional use of suffixes that might be interpreted as articles or direct object markers. The ambiguity and optional nature of these suffixes suggest that they are not robust case markers.

5. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of adjectives and relative qualifiers, showing agreement and the use of suffixes for direct objects. This indicates some morphological marking but does not confirm a full set of cases.

6. **Paragraph 9**: Lists conjunctions and their use with different verb forms, indicating syntactic structures but not directly addressing case marking.

7. **Paragraph 10**: Explains the use of object suffix pronouns in relative clauses, showing agreement in gender and number with the qualified noun. This suggests some level of morphological marking but does not confirm multiple cases.

8. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the use of prepositions and prepositional suffix pronouns to express relationships like ""in which,"" ""on which,"" etc. This indicates the use of prepositions rather than a full case system.

9. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions indefinite pronouns and their use with suffix pronouns, indicating possession and agreement but not a full case system.

10. **Paragraph 13**: Describes the use of adjectives and direct objects, showing agreement and the use of suffixes but not confirming multiple cases.

11. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the use of verbal nouns and their syntactic roles, including subject and direct object positions, with possessive suffixes and prepositions. This suggests some nominal inflection but not a full case system.

12. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions the use of prepositions with possessive constructions, indicating the use of prepositions rather than a full case system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided information, Amharic does not exhibit a robust system of multiple morphological cases. Instead, it uses possessive suffixes, prepositions, and agreement markers to indicate relationships between nouns. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Amharic is:

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Beja,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Beja, the language exhibits the following case distinctions:

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly mentions that ""Two cases are distinguished in the noun-phrase: nominative and accusative,"" and further elaborates that the accusative is also used for genitival constructions. This indicates a system where the nominative and accusative cases are formally distinguished, and the accusative has an additional genitive function.

2. **Paragraph 17** mentions that modifiers show concord of number, gender, and case with the noun, which supports the presence of case distinctions in the language.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides forms for nominative and accusative singular and plural, reinforcing the presence of these two cases.

4. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 4** provide additional context but do not introduce any new cases beyond those already mentioned.

From the information provided, it is clear that Beja has a productive case system with two distinct cases: nominative and accusative, with the accusative also serving a genitive function.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Middle Atlas Berber, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The information given primarily discusses pronouns, prepositions, and verb morphology without indicating distinct noun case paradigms. 

Here is the reasoning for the chosen option:

1. **Pronouns and Prepositions**: The paragraphs discuss various pronoun forms and their usage with prepositions, but this does not constitute a case system for nouns. Pronouns and prepositions are separate from noun case paradigms.

2. **Verb Morphology**: There is significant discussion of verb morphology, including object pronouns and directional indices, but again, this does not indicate a case system for nouns.

3. **Noun Forms**: The mention of noun forms and their behavior with prepositions (e.g., ""n ‘of’ is used if the noun begins with a consonant"") suggests the use of prepositions rather than inflectional case markings to indicate relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.

4. **Kinship Nouns**: The discussion of kinship nouns and possessive pronouns also does not indicate a case system but rather a syntactic and morphological strategy for indicating possession.

5. **Absence of Case Paradigms**: There is no mention of distinct morphological case endings for nouns that would indicate a productive case system.

Given the absence of evidence for a productive case-marking system for nouns in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Diola-Fogny,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Diola-Fogny, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on noun class markers, possessive suffixes, and relational particles to indicate grammatical relationships. Here is the reasoning for this conclusion:

1. **Noun Class Markers and Concord**: The language uses noun class markers extensively to indicate number, size, and other semantic categories (Paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 7, 9). These markers are prefixed to nouns and are integral to the concord system, which affects pronouns, adjectives, and verbs. However, these markers do not function as case markers in the traditional sense of indicating syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, etc.

2. **Possessive Suffixes**: Diola-Fogny employs possessive suffixes to indicate possession (Paragraphs 1, 4, 16). These suffixes are attached to nouns to show ownership but do not extend to marking other syntactic roles.

3. **Relational Particles**: The language uses relational particles to form prepositional phrases, indicating proximity and other relationships (Paragraphs 1, 16). These particles function similarly to prepositions in English and do not constitute a case system.

4. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm where nouns change form to indicate different syntactic roles. The examples provided show that grammatical relationships are expressed through word order, noun class markers, possessive suffixes, and relational particles rather than through morphological case marking.

5. **Genitive and Locative Constructions**: While there are genitive phrases and locative constructions (Paragraphs 1, 16), these do not form a comprehensive case system. The genitive is indicated by possessive suffixes or relational particles, and locatives are formed with specific suffixes or particles, not through a broader case paradigm.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Gimira,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case markers and their functions.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the case system and provides a brief overview.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** describe the locative and nominative case markers, indicating that case markers can be affixed to determiners and final elements of noun phrases.
3. **Paragraph 4** lists several cases with examples:
   - Nominative
   - Accusative
   - Genitive
   - Dative/Benefactive
   - Locative
   - Ablative
4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss the obligatory nature of nominative and accusative suffixes on specific nouns and the use of oblique case forms.
5. **Paragraph 7** mentions the oblique case form as a basic unmarked form used for objects, possessive pronouns, and adverbial cases.
6. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** describe additional suffixes that can replace or be added to case markers, indicating a flexible case-marking system.
7. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** provide examples of embedded noun phrases with genitive, ablative, and locative markers.

### Reasoning:

From the information provided, we can identify the following productive case markers in Gimira:
- **Nominative**: Marks the subject of a sentence.
- **Accusative**: Marks the direct object.
- **Genitive**: Indicates possession.
- **Dative/Benefactive**: Marks the indirect object or beneficiary.
- **Locative**: Indicates location.
- **Ablative**: Indicates movement away from something.

These cases are used productively to mark syntactic and semantic relationships within noun phrases. The presence of these six distinct cases suggests that Gimira has a relatively rich case system.

### Conclusion:

6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Grebo, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text mentions various grammatical structures and elements such as pronouns, postpositions, and possessive constructions, but it does not describe a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would indicate a productive case paradigm.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: Discusses postpositions occurring after nouns and object pronouns, but does not indicate these as part of a case system.
   - **Paragraph 9**: Mentions postpositions and their syntactical distribution, distinguishing them from nouns but not indicating a case system.
   - **Paragraph 13**: Describes possessive pronouns and their order with nouns, but this is not indicative of a case system.
   - **Paragraph 19**: Discusses possessive pronouns and emphatic phrases, again not indicative of a case system.
   - **Other Paragraphs**: Focus on various grammatical elements such as verbal nouns, adjectives, and sentence structures, but none provide evidence of a morphological case system for nouns.

Given the absence of explicit mention of morphological case-marking for nouns, it is reasonable to conclude that Grebo does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that relations of nominals to verbs as subject or object, or to each other as genitives, or to prepositions are expressed by word order and tone. This indicates that there is no morphological case-marking for these syntactic relations.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It reiterates that gender is not grammatically expressed and that person and number are expressed by pronoun sequence. There is no mention of morphological case-marking.

3. **Paragraph 3**: It discusses the tonal expression of subject and object relationships, further supporting the idea that these relationships are not marked morphologically but tonally.

4. **Paragraph 4**: It describes the genitival relationship being expressed by tone and word order, not by morphological case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 5**: It states that the grammatical relations of nouns are expressed by word order and tone, providing examples of genitive, subject, object, and other relationships without any mention of morphological case-marking.

6. **Paragraph 6**: It provides examples of grammatical relationships of nouns, again emphasizing word order and tone without indicating any morphological case-marking.

7. **Paragraph 7**: It discusses the role of tone in expressing grammatical relations, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 8**: It mentions derivational affixes in nouns but does not indicate any case-marking affixes.

9. **Paragraph 9**: It describes the tonal behavior of nouns in various grammatical relationships, confirming that these relationships are not marked morphologically.

10. **Paragraph 10**: It discusses the tonal behavior of nouns and the role of tone in expressing grammatical relations, with no mention of morphological case-marking.

11. **Paragraph 11**: It provides further examples of tonal behavior in grammatical relationships, again without any indication of morphological case-marking.

12. **Paragraph 12**: It discusses the use of tone in expressing grammatical relations, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

13. **Paragraph 13**: It describes the tonal behavior of nouns in genitival relationships, confirming that these relationships are not marked morphologically.

14. **Paragraph 14**: It discusses the tonal behavior of pronouns in grammatical relations, with no mention of morphological case-marking.

15. **Paragraph 15**: It describes the tonal behavior of noun subjects in different verb forms, again without any indication of morphological case-marking.

16. **Paragraph 16**: It discusses the role of tone in expressing grammatical relations, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

17. **Paragraph 17**: It provides examples of tonal behavior in grammatical relationships, again without any indication of morphological case-marking.

18. **Paragraph 18**: It discusses the role of tone in expressing grammatical relations, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

19. **Paragraph 19**: It confirms that grammatical relations are expressed by tone and word order, not by morphological case-marking.

20. **Paragraph 20**: It discusses the role of tone in expressing grammatical relations, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

Based on the information provided, it is clear that Igbo does not use morphological case-marking to express grammatical relations. Instead, these relations are expressed through word order and tone.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Case Clitics**: The text mentions several case clitics such as directive (-i), ablative (-wa), instrumental (-ar), and reason (-sa). These clitics are used to mark nouns for specific syntactic and semantic roles in sentences.

2. **Usage of Case Clitics**: The case clitics can be attached to nouns, pronouns, and even demonstratives, indicating their productive use in the language. Examples include:
   - ""hikwa- kad6ohlLS G :S.l/2 hand:Ml-l .SG.POSS-INSTR dig:l .SG"" ('I dig with my hand.')
   - ""buura a-ndakw->een-aran aqa-qeerxats-ta-ka-r-waS.3 in:CON valley-Fl-INDEF.F-F-ABL HAB-graze:3.SG.F"" ('It usually grazes in a certain valley.')
   - ""kuung-wameetinS .3 2.SG.M- ABL remain-DUR:3.SG.M"" ('He avoids you.')

3. **Construct Case**: There is also mention of a construct case used for nouns followed by modifiers, which is another form of case marking.

4. **Productivity and Variety**: The presence of multiple case clitics and their productive use across different contexts (e.g., with personal pronouns, independent pronouns, and nouns) suggests a robust case system.

Given the evidence of multiple productive case clitics and the construct case, Iraqw exhibits a system with at least four distinct cases: directive, ablative, instrumental, and reason. This places Iraqw in the category of languages with a mid-sized inventory of cases.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,4 cases
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the presence and type of case marking in Kinyarwanda.

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions the use of a possessive genitive case marked by a morpheme, indicating some form of case marking for possession.
2. **Paragraph 6** discusses locative suffixes, which are used to mark locative relations, suggesting the presence of a locative case.
3. **Paragraph 8** refers to benefactive markers, which indicate a benefactive case.
4. **Paragraph 15** mentions the instrumental case, indicating the use of an instrumental marker.

From these observations, it is clear that Kinyarwanda employs specific markers for different semantic relations such as possessive (genitive), locative, benefactive, and instrumental. However, there is no evidence of a full-fledged case system that marks core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or dative. The cases mentioned are more peripheral and semantic in nature.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of specific markers for possessive, locative, benefactive, and instrumental relations suggests that Kinyarwanda has some form of case marking.
- These markers are used for concrete or peripheral relations rather than core grammatical functions.
- There is no indication of a comprehensive case system that includes core syntactic roles like nominative or accusative.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

5. **Paragraph 10**: Reiterates that there is no case in the language.
6. **Paragraph 11**: Confirms that case is not marked at all in Koromfe.
7. **Paragraph 13**: States that Koromfe has no cases, therefore there is no double case marking.
8. **Paragraph 16**: Confirms that Koromfe has no cases, making certain sections inapplicable.
9. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses noun phrases and modifiers but does not mention any case marking, implying its absence.
10. **Paragraph 20**: States that Koromfe does not mark case and no further grammatical categories are marked in the demonstrative.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lango,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Lango by examining the relevant information about noun morphology and syntactic roles.

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly states: ""Nouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord class.""
   - This indicates that Lango does not use morphological case marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 8**:
   - It reiterates: ""Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (à la Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles.""
   - This further confirms the absence of morphological case marking in Lango.

3. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Discusses the order of elements in sentences and mentions that verbs are marked for transitivity, but does not indicate any case marking on nouns.
   - It also describes how direct and indirect objects are handled without mentioning any case inflections.

4. **Paragraph 20**:
   - Describes the structure of noun phrases and the use of determiners, quantifiers, and adjectives, but does not mention any case marking on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Discusses associative constructions and the use of possessive suffixes, but again, there is no mention of case marking.

6. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Talks about the middle voice and reflexive constructions, but does not indicate any case marking on nouns.

From these observations, it is clear that Lango does not employ morphological case marking for nouns. The syntactic roles such as subject, direct object, and indirect object are indicated through word order and other syntactic means rather than through inflectional case markers.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Murle,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made about the case system in Murle:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions accusative and locative/instrumental cases.
2. **Paragraph 2** lists accusative, nominative, and genitive cases.
3. **Paragraph 3** refers to genitive and dative cases.
4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the accusative and locative/instrumental cases.
5. **Paragraph 5** mentions nominative and plural case endings.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses the nominative case.
7. **Paragraph 7** mentions locative/instrumental case.
8. **Paragraph 8** refers to dative and genitive cases.
9. **Paragraph 9** lists genitive, accusative, nominative, and locative/instrumental cases.
10. **Paragraph 10** mentions accusative and nominative cases.
11. **Paragraph 11** discusses nominative case.
12. **Paragraph 12** refers to dative case.
13. **Paragraph 13** mentions nominative case.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses dative and genitive cases.
15. **Paragraph 15** does not provide new information about cases.
16. **Paragraph 16** does not provide new information about cases.
17. **Paragraph 17** does not provide new information about cases.
18. **Paragraph 18** does not provide new information about cases.
19. **Paragraph 19** does not provide new information about cases.
20. **Paragraph 20** does not provide new information about cases.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Murle:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Locative/Instrumental

This gives us a total of five distinct cases.

**Reasoning:**
The descriptive grammar excerpts indicate that Murle has productive case paradigms for nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative/instrumental cases. These cases are mentioned multiple times across different contexts, suggesting they are part of the core grammatical structure of the language.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Nama,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case system in Nama as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions a suffix in Nama that has the canonical form V, called the subordinative suffix -d, which follows a noun suffix indicating person, gender, and number. This suffix appears to function similarly to a case marker in other languages, marking noun phrases of subordinate status in the sentence.

2. **Paragraph 19** elaborates on the subordinative suffix -d, describing it as analogous to a ""case"" morpheme in other languages. It indicates that Nama has an ""unmarked"" case (no suffix) and a ""marked"" case (with the subordinative -d suffix). Additionally, there are remnants of an ""agentive case"" marked by -i in certain fixed expressions. However, the analysis suggests that the grammar of Nama noun phrases can be described with just one productive case morpheme, the subordinative -d.

3. **Paragraph 11** discusses embedding in post-positional phrases and mentions that embedding in a noun before certain post-positions is semantically similar to embedding in certain adverbial constructions. This suggests that post-positions might play a role similar to case markers in indicating relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

4. **Paragraph 12** describes the gender and number system in Nama, indicating that gender and number are marked by specific suffixes. However, it does not provide evidence of additional case markers beyond the subordinative -d and the agentive -i.

5. **Paragraph 18** discusses the use of adjectives as noun phrase complements and mentions the applicative suffix -pa, which can be used with adjectives. This indicates that Nama uses suffixes to modify the meaning of nouns and adjectives, but it does not provide evidence of additional case markers.

From the information provided, it appears that Nama has a limited case system with one productive case marker, the subordinative -d, and remnants of an agentive case marked by -i. There is no evidence of a more extensive case system with multiple distinct case markers.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. The information provided focuses on pronouns, verb agreement, postpositions, and nominalization, but there is no evidence of a morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence seem to be expressed through other means such as word order, postpositions, and verb agreement markers.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses cliticization of subject and object pronouns to the verb stem, indicating a reliance on verb morphology rather than noun case marking.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions postpositions that take nominal elements as modifiers, suggesting the use of postpositions rather than case markers to indicate relationships.
3. **Paragraph 7**: Describes possessive pronouns and their placement relative to nouns, but does not mention any case marking on the nouns themselves.
4. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the use of the noun ""idza"" both as a noun and a locative modifier, again indicating the use of postpositions for locative functions rather than case marking.
5. **Paragraph 11**: Provides examples of nominalized postpositional phrases functioning as modifiers, further supporting the use of postpositions instead of case marking.
6. **Paragraph 15**: Lists possessive pronouns and their forms, but no mention of case marking on nouns.
7. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the modification of postpositions by personal pronouns, indicating that relational functions are handled by postpositions rather than noun case marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Oromo (Harar),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Oromo (Harar) by analyzing the relevant information about case marking.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the agreement categories including ""case (absolute/nominative).""
2. **Paragraph 2** indicates that nouns can occur in the ""absolutive case"" and mentions the ""nominative"" case.
3. **Paragraph 3** lists various cases including ""absolutive,"" ""nominative,"" ""dative,"" ""genitive,"" ""instrumental,"" and ""locative.""
4. **Paragraph 5** reiterates the presence of ""absolutive/nominative"" cases.
5. **Paragraph 6** provides an example with the nominative case.
6. **Paragraph 9** discusses dative objects.
7. **Paragraph 10** mentions possessives and relative clauses, which often involve genitive case marking.
8. **Paragraph 13** lists suffixes including ""locative"" and ""dative.""

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Oromo (Harar):
- Absolutive
- Nominative
- Dative
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Locative

This gives us a total of six distinct cases.

**Reasoning:**
The descriptive grammar of Oromo (Harar) indicates the presence of six distinct cases: absolutive, nominative, dative, genitive, instrumental, and locative. These cases are mentioned explicitly and are used productively in the language.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Sango,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sango, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The paragraphs mention various uses of pronouns, noun phrases, and adjunctives, but there is no indication of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, the language seems to rely on word order and function words (such as prepositions) to express grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss pronouns and noun phrases in various syntactic roles but do not mention any morphological case markers.
   - The examples provided focus on the syntactic positions and functions of nouns and pronouns without indicating any inflectional changes to mark case.
   - The use of prepositions like ""na"" suggests that Sango uses prepositional phrases rather than morphological case-marking to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Supyire as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the structure of simple clauses and mentions ""semantic and pragmatic nominal roles ('cases')"" but does not provide specific details on morphological case-marking.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions the benefactive case role marked by the postposition ""ä"" and the associative and instrumental cases marked by the preposition-postposition pair ""ui...nä"". These are examples of peripheral case roles marked by adpositions rather than morphological case markers on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Reiterates the benefactive case role marked by the dative postposition ""ä"".

4. **Paragraph 4**: States that Supyire pronouns are not sensitive to case, with the exception of the first person singular non-declarative pronoun, which cannot be a subject. This suggests a lack of morphological case-marking on pronouns.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions that Supyire does not extensively use serial verbs as case markers, indicating that case marking is not a primary function of serial verbs in this language.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses peripheral case roles marked by adpositions or as direct objects of serial verbs, reinforcing the use of adpositions rather than morphological case markers.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Describes copular clauses with locative or dative phrases, again using adpositional phrases rather than morphological case markers.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses noun genders and agreement within the noun phrase but does not mention morphological case-marking.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Provides examples of coreferential noun phrases as direct or indirect objects, but these are marked by word order and context rather than morphological case markers.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses pronouns and their tonal behavior but confirms that pronouns are not sensitive to case.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Lists references and does not provide relevant information on case-marking.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions the use of postpositions for marking standards of comparison, again indicating the use of adpositions rather than morphological case markers.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the use of pronouns and determiners but does not mention morphological case-marking.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Describes adpositions used to mark oblique cases, reinforcing the use of adpositions rather than morphological case markers.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions the use of postpositions in poetry but does not provide relevant information on morphological case-marking.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses verbs and their complements but does not mention morphological case-marking.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Describes genitive constructions marked by tonal changes rather than morphological case markers.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Lists subjects and their treatments but does not provide relevant information on case-marking.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses descriptive genitive phrases using possessive pronouns but does not mention morphological case-marking.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Describes the use of coreferential noun phrases and quantifiers but does not mention morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Supyire primarily uses adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) to mark various case roles such as benefactive, associative, instrumental, locative, and dative. There is no evidence of a productive morphological case-marking system on nouns. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Supyire is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mambai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system of Mambai. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Paragraph 13 describes possessive constructions where the possessed noun exhibits a linked form and the possessor noun exhibits the unmarked free form. This suggests a syntactic strategy rather than morphological case-marking.

2. **Pronouns**:
   - Paragraph 15 outlines the personal pronoun system, which includes subject, object, and possessive pronouns. The pronouns are used to mark subjects, objects, and possessors, indicating that pronouns carry the burden of marking grammatical relations rather than case suffixes on nouns.

3. **Verbal Inflection**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17 discuss various aspects of verbal inflection, including subject pronouns and verb forms. The use of subject pronouns and verbal suffixes to indicate tense, aspect, and mood further suggests that Mambai relies on verbal morphology and pronouns rather than nominal case-marking.

4. **Noun Phrases**:
   - Paragraph 13 also mentions noun + noun phrases and noun + adjective phrases, where the head noun exhibits a linked form, and the dependent element is unmarked. This again points to syntactic structuring rather than morphological case-marking.

5. **Reflexive and Reciprocal Constructions**:
   - Paragraph 17 discusses reflexive object pronouns, which are formed using the noun for 'body' combined with possessive pronouns. This indicates a strategy of using pronouns and specific constructions rather than case suffixes.

6. **Absence of Case Suffixes**:
   - Throughout the provided text, there is no mention of specific case suffixes attached to nouns to mark grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the language uses pronouns and syntactic positioning.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Mambai does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on pronouns, verbal inflection, and syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relations.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Jamsay,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, it is evident that the language employs postpositions to mark locative, instrumental, and dative functions. The postposition ""le$"" is used variably to indicate these roles, as seen in examples (443) through (447). Additionally, there are tonal locatives formed by adding an L-tone to noun stems, which function as locative adverbs without requiring a postposition.

However, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or genitive. The examples provided primarily show the use of postpositions and tonal modifications to indicate locative and instrumental roles, which are more characteristic of peripheral or semantic case relations rather than a full-fledged case system.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Jamsay in terms of case-marking is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This classification is due to the presence of overt marking for locative and instrumental relations but the absence of a broader, productive case paradigm for core grammatical functions.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

13. **Paragraph 13**: It discusses the copulative case and its properties, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

14. **Paragraph 14**: It provides examples of the oblique case in use, reinforcing the presence of multiple cases.

15. **Paragraph 15**: It discusses the semantic roles of the accusative case, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

16. **Paragraph 16**: It discusses the grammaticalization of case markers, indicating a rich case system.

17. **Paragraph 17**: It provides a detailed paradigm for the genitive case, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

18. **Paragraph 18**: It provides a case paradigm for free personal pronouns, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

19. **Paragraph 19**: It provides a detailed paradigm for the accusative case, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

20. **Paragraph 20**: It provides a detailed paradigm for the instrumental case, supporting the presence of multiple cases.

### Conclusion:

**Conclusion: 8-9 cases**",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Pronouns and Case**:
   - Emai pronouns reflect case distinctions such as nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive (Paragraph 1).
   - The pronouns show different forms for these cases, indicating a productive case system for pronouns.

2. **Noun Inflection**:
   - There is no mention of case suffixes or prefixes attached to nouns to mark different grammatical relations (Paragraph 5).
   - The discussion on noun inflection focuses on number and gender, not on case-marking.

3. **Bound Pronouns**:
   - The language uses bound pronouns like reflexive, reciprocal, and logophoric pronouns (Paragraph 10).
   - These pronouns are used to track grammatical relations but do not indicate a broader case-marking system for nouns.

4. **Postverbal Particles**:
   - The use of postverbal particles (e.g., for locative or temporal relations) suggests that Emai relies on particles rather than inflectional case markers to indicate certain grammatical relations (Paragraph 19).

5. **Relative Clauses and Modifiers**:
   - The structure of relative clauses and the use of modifiers do not indicate the presence of case-marking on nouns (Paragraph 20).

6. **General Observations**:
   - Throughout the paragraphs, there is no evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The grammatical relations are primarily indicated through word order, particles, and pronouns rather than through morphological case markers on nouns.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Emai does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The language uses pronouns with distinct forms for different cases, but nouns themselves do not show morphological case-marking. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Emai is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Nyimang:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Ablative
- Locative

This gives us a total of six cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to identify clear evidence of a productive case system in Ma'di. The paragraphs discuss various syntactic structures, pronominal usage, and possessive constructions, but there is no explicit mention of a systematic morphological case-marking paradigm for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses an idiomatic expression but does not provide evidence of case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 2** mentions a specific construction involving the particle ""nä"" but does not indicate a broader case system.
3. **Paragraph 3** focuses on pronominal and numeral constructions without indicating case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 4** discusses definite and specific noun phrases but does not mention case morphology.
5. **Paragraph 5** talks about possessive constructions using ""nâ"" but does not provide evidence of a case system.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses pluralization of pronouns and indefinite pronouns without indicating case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 7** provides examples of possessive constructions but does not indicate a case system.
8. **Paragraph 8** discusses verb forms and adverbials without mentioning case-marking.
9. **Paragraph 9** describes thematic roles and detransitivization but does not provide evidence of case-marking.
10. **Paragraph 10** discusses adverbials and determiners without indicating case-marking.
11. **Paragraph 11** describes the use of determiners and pronominals without mentioning case-marking.
12. **Paragraph 12** discusses possessive and grammatical ""ni"" but does not provide evidence of a case system.
13. **Paragraph 13** mentions verb suffixes and subordinate clauses but does not indicate case-marking.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses pronominal subjects in nonverbal predicates without mentioning case-marking.
15. **Paragraph 15** describes arguments and pronominal subjects without indicating case-marking.
16. **Paragraph 16** discusses postmodifiers and determiners without mentioning case-marking.
17. **Paragraph 17** describes cognate objects and their syntactic behavior without indicating case-marking.
18. **Paragraph 18** discusses focus constructions and reported speech without mentioning case-marking.
19. **Paragraph 19** describes headless relatives and adverbials without indicating case-marking.
20. **Paragraph 20** discusses demonstratives and specific determiners without mentioning case-marking.

Given the absence of explicit evidence for a productive case-marking system in the provided paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that Ma'di does not have a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs, here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases in the language Seme:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses pronouns in Seme and mentions that pronouns do not inflect for grammatical function, meaning the same form is used in subject, object, and postpositional object positions. This suggests that there is no morphological case-marking for pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph mentions the structure of the nominal projection in Seme, including nouns, adjectives, plural enclitics, definite enclitics, demonstrative suffixes, and possessive particles. However, it does not mention any case markers for nouns, which implies that nouns may not have morphological case-marking either.

3. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the third person singular pronoun à, which also functions as a definite particle. It further supports the idea that pronouns do not inflect for case and instead use particles for definiteness.

4. **Paragraph 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20**: These paragraphs do not provide any information about case-marking on nouns or pronouns.

Given the information from the relevant paragraphs, it appears that Seme does not have productive case paradigms for nouns or pronouns. Instead, it uses other means such as word order, particles, and context to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers, and their roles are identified by constituent order. This suggests that there is no overt morphological case-marking for these core grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It discusses pronominal forms before postpositions and mentions that postpositions specify marked cases, generally spatial in nature. This indicates that Koyra Chiini uses postpositions to mark certain grammatical relations, particularly spatial ones.

3. **Paragraph 3**: It shows distinct subject and object forms for certain personal pronouns, indicating some level of morphological differentiation for these roles in pronouns, but not necessarily for full nouns.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It reiterates that Koyra Chiini has no overt case marking for postverbal NPs in either equational or transitive sentences, reinforcing the lack of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations.

5. **Paragraph 9**: It describes the structure of NPs and mentions that subject and direct object NPs have zero case, which can be informally considered as nominative. It also notes that certain adverbial modifiers can be analyzed as zero case forms of nouns.

6. **Paragraph 13**: It discusses the cliticization of pronominal objects and pronominal PPs, indicating that pronominal forms can be encliticized but does not provide evidence of a full case system for nouns.

7. **Paragraph 17**: It mentions the use of pronouns in various syntactic roles, including direct object and postpositional complements, but does not indicate a broader case system for nouns.

8. **Paragraph 19**: It discusses quantificational adjectives and their placement in NPs but does not provide evidence of a case system.

From these points, it is clear that Koyra Chiini primarily uses word order and postpositions to mark grammatical relations, with some morphological differentiation in pronouns but not in full nouns. The language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns but does have postpositions that mark spatial and other relations.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions nominative, genitive, dative, locative, and accusative cases. It also discusses the overlap in forms between some of these cases.
2. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states that Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language and lists nominative, accusative, and dative cases.
3. **Paragraph 5** adds that the allative and ablative-instrumental cases are also present.
4. **Paragraph 6** discusses the genitive case and its marking.
5. **Paragraph 14** summarizes the case marking on nouns, listing nominative, accusative, dative, locative, allative, and ablative-instrumental cases.
6. **Paragraph 17** provides details on the dative-locative case suffix.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Sidaama:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Locative
- Allative
- Ablative-Instrumental

This gives us a total of 7 distinct cases. Given the overlap in forms between some cases (e.g., dative and locative), the number of distinct cases falls within the range of 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kunama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kunama, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that what is broadly included under the category of case in Kunama is realized by the use of postpositions. It explicitly states that ""inflectional case is lacking in Kunama"" unless a specific tone-marked example proves to be correct. This suggests that Kunama does not have a productive system of inflectional case marking.

2. **Paragraph 6** reinforces this by stating that other nominal relationships, such as locative, are also expressed by postpositions. This further supports the idea that Kunama relies on postpositions rather than inflectional case marking.

3. **Paragraph 9** mentions the use of the postposition +si for dative (and also accusative), indicating that these roles are marked by postpositions rather than inflectional case endings.

4. **Paragraph 8** discusses genitive constructions, which are either simple juxtaposition or use a genitive suffix -yna. However, this does not indicate a full-fledged case system but rather a specific marker for possession.

From these points, it is clear that Kunama does not have a productive inflectional case system but instead uses postpositions to mark grammatical relationships. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, and not for core grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, the following observations can be made regarding the case-marking system of the language:

1. **Peripheral Noun Phrases and Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions ""peripheral noun phrases"" and ""case enclitics"" that encode various meanings such as adessive, allative, and elative roles. This indicates the presence of specific case markers for different semantic roles.

2. **Role Structure and Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 5 discusses the semantic roles and the overt case markers that encode them. It lists several roles such as adessive, path, allative, elative, efficient cause, point of reference, interior location, surface location, and temporal reference. This suggests a variety of cases used to mark different roles.

3. **Genitive Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 9 specifically mentions genitive case marking on clausal participants, indicating that genitive is one of the cases in Alamblak.

4. **General Setting and Modal Roles**:
   - Paragraphs 13 and 15 discuss the general setting case marker and modal roles, including manner and instrument roles, which are encoded by specific case markers.

5. **Syntactic Features and Case Frames**:
   - Paragraph 16 indicates that the subject NP is unmarked for case, while other roles such as patient and recipient are marked, suggesting a nominative-accusative alignment.

6. **Embedded Clauses and Genitive Forms**:
   - Paragraph 8 discusses the use of genitive forms in embedded clauses, further supporting the presence of a genitive case.

From these observations, it is clear that Alamblak has a productive case-marking system with multiple cases. The language encodes various semantic roles through specific case markers, including adessive, allative, elative, genitive, and others related to spatial and temporal orientation.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of multiple specific case markers for different roles (adessive, allative, elative, genitive, etc.) indicates that Alamblak has a relatively large inventory of cases.
- The discussion of different roles and their corresponding case markers suggests that the language has more than just a few cases.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns in Amele. The text primarily discusses various syntactic functions and the use of pronouns, but it does not provide explicit information about morphological case-marking on nouns. The references to pronouns and their agreement with verbs, as well as the use of word order to distinguish syntactic roles, suggest that Amele may not rely on morphological case-marking for nouns.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the syntactic functions of nouns and pronouns but does not indicate any morphological case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 5** discusses word order as a significant factor for distinguishing syntactic roles, implying that word order, rather than morphological case, is used to indicate grammatical relations.
3. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** describe object marking on verbs and the semantic functions of indirect objects, but again, there is no mention of morphological case-marking on nouns.
4. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss possession and the use of pronouns in possessive constructions, but they do not provide evidence of case-marking on nouns.

Given the absence of explicit information about morphological case-marking on nouns and the reliance on word order and verbal agreement to indicate syntactic roles, it is reasonable to conclude that Amele does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns in Mountain Arapesh. The text mentions various grammatical features such as verb classes, noun classes, possessive pronouns, and agreement in number and class, but it does not provide explicit information about a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it seems to focus on other means of encoding grammatical relations, such as verb affixation and noun phrase agreement.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Paragraph 1** discusses case frames for verbs but does not mention specific case markers for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 4** describe noun classes and agreement but do not indicate morphological case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss object markers and verb affixation rather than noun case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** focus on noun phrases and possessive constructions without mentioning case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** describe verb structures and subject/object markers, not noun cases.

Given the absence of explicit mention of morphological case-marking for nouns in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is that Mountain Arapesh does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses non-interrogative pronouns and their morphological valence, but does not provide clear evidence of case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions possessive pronouns linked to kinship terms, but this is more about possessive constructions rather than case marking.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Talks about core categories and some semantic elements, but does not mention morphological case marking.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Describes syntactical valence and the ability of personal possessive pronouns to form groups with various word classes, but again, no clear case marking.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions singular and plural forms of substantives but does not indicate case marking.
6. **Paragraph 7**: Contains examples of negation and possessive pronouns, but no case marking.
7. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses formal characteristics of verbs, not relevant to noun case marking.
8. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions directional pronouns and their syntactical valence, but no case marking.
9. **Paragraph 10**: Focuses on verbal morphology, not noun case marking.
10. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses demonstrative pronouns and their linkage to other elements, but no case marking.
11. **Paragraph 12**: Describes aspect suffixes and tense suffixes in verbs, not relevant to noun case marking.
12. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses object categories in verbs, not relevant to noun case marking.
13. **Paragraph 14**: Provides paradigms for verbs, not relevant to noun case marking.
14. **Paragraph 15**: Lists contents and sections of the grammar, not directly relevant.
15. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions kinship terms and plural categories, but no case marking.
16. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses possessive pronouns and their derivatives, but no case marking.
17. **Paragraph 18**: Talks about free variation in speech, not relevant to noun case marking.
18. **Paragraph 19**: Describes verbal forms and their semantic elements, not relevant to noun case marking.
19. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions directional pronouns and their linkage, but no case marking.

From the analysis, it is evident that the provided paragraphs do not indicate a productive case paradigm for nouns in Asmat. Instead, they focus on possessive pronouns, kinship terms, and verbal morphology. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion based on the available information is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Batak (Karo), the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The evidence suggests that syntactic and semantic relationships are primarily expressed through word order and possessive constructions rather than through morphological case markers.

1. **Paragraph 2** discusses possessive constructions and the ordering of possessive and descriptive elements within noun phrases. It mentions the use of possessive pronouns and genitive markers in archaic expressions but does not indicate a broader system of case marking.
2. **Paragraph 4** describes the use of possessive pronouns and their placement within noun phrases, again focusing on possessive relationships rather than a full case system.
3. **Paragraph 6** mentions the omission of locative prepositions in certain dialects, indicating that locative relationships are expressed through prepositions rather than morphological case.
4. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the roles of actors and undergoers in clauses, using verb prefixes to mark these roles rather than case markers on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 19** mentions possessive NPs with inalienable body parts or actions but does not suggest a broader case system.

The overall evidence points to the absence of a productive morphological case-marking system in Batak (Karo). Instead, relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are managed through word order, possessive constructions, and prepositions.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, Chamorro does not exhibit a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. The language primarily uses word order, possessive pronouns, and classifiers to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. There is no evidence of a system of morphological case-marking that would classify Chamorro as having multiple productive cases.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses morphemes and provides examples of how words are formed and modified in Chamorro, but it does not mention any case-marking system.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** describe pronouns and their functions, including subject markers and possessive pronouns, but again, there is no mention of case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss nominalization and possession, indicating that possessive pronouns are used to show possession, but there is no indication of a broader case system.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** focus on nouns and articles, showing that nouns can function as subjects or objects based on their position in the sentence, without any case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 9** discuss modification and classifiers, which are used in possessive constructions but do not constitute a case system.
6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** further elaborate on possessive constructions and the use of classifiers, reinforcing the absence of case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** describe verb forms and sentence structures, emphasizing word order and verb affixes rather than case-marking.
8. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss modifiers and their functions, again without reference to case-marking.
9. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** detail the ordering of affixes and irregular verbs, focusing on verb morphology rather than noun case-marking.
10. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** continue the discussion on verbs and their grammatical features, with no mention of case-marking.
11. **Paragraph 20** summarizes verb phrases and pluralization, indicating that Chamorro uses prefixes for plural marking but does not employ a case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Daga,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Daga, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions various suffixes that can be attached to nouns, including possessive suffixes and intensifier suffixes. However, these suffixes do not indicate a productive case system but rather possessive relationships and intensification.

2. **Paragraph 3** describes intimate possessive suffixes used with nouns, indicating possession rather than grammatical case relationships such as nominative, accusative, etc.

3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss the roles of pronouns in various syntactic positions but do not mention case marking. Instead, they highlight the use of verbal suffixes to replace free pronouns in object or indirect object positions.

4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** mention nominalized verbs and adjectives but do not provide evidence of a case system. The focus is on the roles these forms play in phrases and clauses.

5. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss postpositions and their roles in phrases, which suggests that relational meanings (such as accompaniment and comparison) are expressed through postpositions rather than case inflections.

6. **Paragraph 18** describes the structure of possessive phrases, again focusing on possession rather than case marking.

7. **Paragraph 20** mentions the substantive clitic -wa, which marks a substantive relationship but does not indicate a case system.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Daga does not exhibit a productive case system for marking grammatical relationships on nouns. Instead, it relies on possessive suffixes, postpositions, and clitics to express relational meanings.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dani (Lower Grand Valley), the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on other mechanisms such as word order, post-positions, and verb affixation to mark syntactic and semantic relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1** mentions that case relations are marked in post-positions and verbs, suggesting that Dani does not use morphological case-marking on nouns.
   - **Paragraph 9** discusses the marking of independent nouns and pronouns in the agent role, hinting at an ergative structure but not indicating a productive case system.
   - **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** emphasize the role of word order, post-positions, and verb affixation in signaling case or role relationships, further supporting the absence of a morphological case system on nouns.
   - **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** describe the use of noun phrases, independent pronouns, and pronominal affixes to refer to participants, which aligns with a lack of morphological case-marking on nouns.

Given these observations, it is clear that Dani does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns and instead uses other syntactic and morphological strategies to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is insufficient information to determine the number of cases in Hamtai. The paragraphs do not provide clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. They mention various pronouns, possessive forms, and some syntactic structures, but there is no explicit discussion of morphological case-marking on nouns.

Given the lack of specific information about case-marking, it is not possible to conclude definitively whether Hamtai has morphological case-marking or not, or how many cases it might have if it does.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Hua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hua, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Nominative (or Absolutive) Case**: This is the unmarked case used for subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect objects of transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal compounds. It is marked by the suffix ø or -a in certain contexts.
   
2. **Ergative Case**: This case is used for subjects of transitive verbs. It has distinct forms in the singular and plural, such as /mu'/ and -mi.

3. **Genitive Case**: This case is used to create possessive phrases and acts as an adjective. It has both singular and plural forms, such as -ma' and -'i'.

4. **Locative/Allative Case**: This case is used to indicate location or direction, marked by suffixes like -ro'.

5. **Inessive/Illative Case**: This case indicates being inside or moving into something, marked by suffixes like -vi'.

6. **Ablative Case**: This case indicates movement away from something, marked by suffixes like -roti'.

7. **Elative Case**: This case indicates movement out of something, marked by suffixes like -viti'.

8. **Benefactive Case**: This case indicates the beneficiary of an action, marked by the suffix -hi'.

9. **Comitative Case**: This case indicates accompaniment, marked by the suffix -Ki'.

10. **Vocative Case**: Although traditionally named a case, it differs syntactically and is used for direct address, marked by suffixes like -a and -o.

Given the above analysis, Hua has a productive case system with at least ten distinct cases: nominative, ergative, genitive, locative/allative, inessive/illative, ablative, elative, benefactive, comitative, and vocative.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Ilocano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, the language exhibits a case system that includes both core and oblique cases. Here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases:

1. **Core Cases**: 
   - The core cases include the absolutive and ergative cases. The absolutive case is used for the single argument of intransitive verbs and the patient (object) of transitive verbs. The ergative case is used for the actor (subject) of transitive verbs.
   - Examples: 
     - ""nakita"" (saw) - Nakítanak ni Maria. (Maria saw me) - Here, ""Maria"" is in the ergative case, and ""me"" is in the absolutive case.
     - ""Intédko ti kuartá kenní Juan."" (I gave the money to Juan) - ""I"" is in the ergative case, ""money"" is in the absolutive case, and ""Juan"" is in the oblique case.

2. **Oblique Case**:
   - The oblique case is used for peripheral arguments, such as locations, recipients, and other non-core arguments.
   - Examples:
     - ""Intédko ti kuartá kenní Juan."" (I gave the money to Juan) - ""Juan"" is in the oblique case.

3. **Additional Cases**:
   - The language also marks benefactive, instrumental, and comitative cases, which are typically considered peripheral or concrete cases.
   - Examples:
     - Benefactive: ""idaitan"" (to sew for someone) - Indaitak ni Maria iti bado. (I sewed a dress for Mary).
     - Instrumental: ""pagdait"" (to sew with something) - Pinagdâitna ti dâgum. (He used the needle to sew).
     - Comitative: ""kasao"" (to speak with someone) - Kinasaok ni Maria. (I spoke with Maria).

Given the presence of core cases (absolutive and ergative) and additional peripheral cases (benefactive, instrumental, comitative), Ilocano has a productive case system that includes more than just core syntactic roles.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.**

The reasoning is that while Ilocano has clear marking for core syntactic roles (absolutive and ergative), it also has specific markers for peripheral roles such as benefactive, instrumental, and comitative, which are typically considered borderline cases. Therefore, the language fits the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Imonda,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Imonda exhibits the following case-marking characteristics:

1. **Paragraph 2** indicates that the case marker `-m` is used optionally to mark objects and has syntactic significance. It also marks oblique NPs expressing goal, purpose, recipient, and beneficiary, as well as the oblique accompanier NP.
2. **Paragraph 9** lists the case markers for peripheral NPs in Imonda: locative (`-ia`), cause (`-ia`), goal (`-m`), source (`-n8i`), and instrument (`-na(-m)`).
3. **Paragraph 10** discusses the multifunctionality of the case marker `-m`, which primarily serves as a goal marker but also marks recipients, benefactives, and human objects.
4. **Paragraph 19** mentions the optional deletion of the final `-m` in connected speech, indicating its phonological integration.

From these details, it is clear that Imonda has a system where the case markers are primarily used for marking peripheral or semantic roles rather than core syntactic functions. The core arguments (subject and object) are not consistently marked by case, and the marking appears to be optional or context-dependent, particularly for human objects.

Given the information, Imonda's case system does not fit neatly into the categories of having a specific number of cases for core syntactic roles. Instead, it primarily uses case markers for peripheral roles, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Atayal,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 5** mention that Atayal uses nominative, genitive, and dative cases.
2. **Paragraph 3** elaborates that the nominative case is used for the subject, predicate, and topic of a sentence.
3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 17** indicate that the verb in Atayal can indicate case relations, specifically oriented to the subject or predicate.
4. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 14** mention that the agent is in the genitive case, and the direct object can be in the nominative case.
5. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the genitive case being used for possession and the order of possessive pronouns.
6. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of the dative case being used for objects of prepositions and phrases meaning ""belong to,"" as well as for expressing location.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Atayal has a productive case system with three distinct cases: nominative, genitive, and dative. There is no mention of additional cases beyond these three, nor is there evidence of exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can infer the following about the case system in Kewa:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that case markers in Kewa are described according to their function at various grammatical levels, including what corresponds to the genitive case. This indicates that Kewa has a genitive case.

2. **Paragraph 3** refers to clitics such as -me and -para as surface case markers for certain tagmemes. This suggests that these clitics function as case markers, likely indicating roles such as agent and locative.

3. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of phrases with -para (locative) and -me (instrumental or specifier), indicating that Kewa has locative and instrumental cases.

4. **Paragraph 12** mentions an accusative case marker -daa, which often marks the object-as-referent.

5. **Paragraph 14** discusses possessive noun phrases marked by the clitic -na, indicating a possessive (genitive) case.

6. **Paragraph 19** further supports the presence of the possessive case with the clitic -na marking inclusion or possession between the head and modification tagmemes.

From these observations, we can conclude that Kewa has at least the following cases:
- Nominative (implied as the default case)
- Accusative (-daa)
- Genitive (-na)
- Locative (-para)
- Instrumental (-me)

This gives us a total of at least five cases.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",6-7 cases,5 cases
Kobon,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system in Kobon. The language appears to rely more on word order, verbal inflection, and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations rather than using morphological case markers on nouns.

Kombai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, the language does not exhibit productive case paradigms of nouns. The evidence suggests that Kombai relies on other grammatical mechanisms rather than morphological case-marking to express syntactic and semantic relationships between nouns and their heads.

Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Noun Morphology**: Paragraph 1 explicitly states that apart from possessive pronominal prefixes, there is no noun-related morphology in Kombai. This indicates a lack of morphological case-marking on nouns.

2. **Pronouns and Possession**: Paragraph 1 also describes possessive forms of pronouns but does not mention any case markers. The possessive forms are created by prefixing pronouns to nouns, which is not indicative of a case system but rather a possessive construction.

3. **Relational Nouns**: Paragraphs 8, 10, and 13 discuss relational nouns like ""ro"" (thing) and ""rumu"" (person) used in various grammatical contexts, such as question-words, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses. These relational nouns serve as grammatical heads but do not exhibit case inflections.

4. **Head Noun Insertion**: Paragraph 5 mentions that in subordinate clauses, head noun insertion takes place to give a nominal form to the clause, rather than using case markers.

5. **Absence of Case Examples**: Throughout the provided paragraphs, there are no examples or descriptions of nouns being inflected for case. The focus is on other grammatical elements like possessive prefixes, relational nouns, and connective markers.

Given this information, it is clear that Kombai does not utilize morphological case-marking for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can identify the presence of case marking in the language. Here are the relevant points:

1. **Locative Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions locational nouns that can take the locative suffix ""-n"" (e.g., ""fela'koe-n"" for ""village-LOC"").
   - Paragraph 8 further discusses locative-suffixed nouns functioning as adjuncts and provides examples of locative-marked nouns.

2. **Perlative Case**:
   - Paragraph 8 also mentions the Perlative suffix ""-ne"" used for motion through or along a line (e.g., ""orarava-ne"" for ""side-PERL"").

3. **Possessive Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions possession marked by a prefix on the possessed noun.

4. **Discussion of Cases**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 8 discuss the use of locative and perlative suffixes, indicating that these are productive and significant in the language's grammar.

5. **Number of Cases**:
   - The excerpts do not mention any other cases beyond the locative and perlative. The possessive marking is not typically counted as a case in the traditional sense but rather as a possessive construction.

Given this information, Lavukaleve appears to have overt marking for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or perlatives, but does not exhibit a broader range of grammatical cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"### Reasoning:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mokilese, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The information primarily discusses possessive constructions, pronouns, and other morphological features, but it does not indicate the presence of distinct morphological case markers for syntactic functions such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: The language uses possessive suffixes to indicate possession, which vary depending on the person and number of the possessor (Paragraphs 1, 8, 14). These possessive suffixes do not constitute a case system but rather a possessive marking system.

2. **Pronouns**: The discussion on pronouns (Paragraphs 3, 16, 18) indicates that Mokilese has a rich system of personal pronouns that vary by number and inclusivity, but this does not imply a case system for nouns.

3. **Locative and Construct Forms**: There are mentions of locative forms and construct forms (Paragraphs 7, 10, 19), which suggest some morphological marking for specific relational or locative functions. However, these are not part of a broader, productive case system but rather specific markers for certain relational contexts.

4. **No Mention of Core Cases**: There is no mention of core grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc., which are typically part of a productive case system.

Given the absence of evidence for a productive case paradigm and the presence of specific markers for possession and location, the most appropriate classification for Mokilese is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Palauan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Palauan, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses pronouns, possessive suffixes, and other grammatical features without indicating the presence of a case system that marks nouns for grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraphs on Pronouns and Possessive Suffixes**: The text mentions various pronouns and possessive suffixes but does not indicate that these are part of a case system for nouns. Instead, they seem to function independently or as part of possessive constructions.
2. **Absence of Case Marking Information**: There is no information about nouns being marked for different grammatical cases. The discussion focuses on other grammatical aspects such as pronouns, verb forms, and possessive constructions.
3. **Focus on Possessive Constructions**: The grammar discusses possessive suffixes extensively, which are used to indicate possession rather than grammatical case.

Given the lack of evidence for a productive case system in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is that Palauan does not have morphological case-marking for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses verbal morphology, personal pronouns, and possessive forms, but it does not provide evidence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that fits the definition of grammatical case as outlined.

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions ""pseudo-flexion of 'genitive' (possessive) forms through apophony,"" suggesting that possessive relationships are indicated through changes in the form of the pronoun rather than through a distinct genitive case marker.
2. **Paragraph 4** describes possessive forms and their usage but does not indicate a broader system of case-marking for other syntactic functions.
3. **Paragraph 13** discusses postpositional and subordinative combinations, which might serve functions similar to cases in other languages, but these are not described as morphological case markers.
4. **Paragraph 17** lists types of subordinative combinations but again does not mention morphological case-marking.

Given this information, Sentani does not appear to have a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on other means such as possessive forms and postpositional phrases to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is insufficient evidence to determine the number of productive case paradigms in Suena. The paragraphs do not provide explicit information about the presence or absence of morphological case-marking on nouns, nor do they describe any specific case markers or their functions.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss various aspects of Suena grammar, including verb moods, noun phrases, and sentence structure, but do not mention case-marking.
   - There is no information about specific case suffixes or their usage in marking grammatical relations.
   - The paragraphs do not provide examples of noun inflection that would indicate the presence of a case system.

Given the lack of relevant information, it is not possible to determine the number of cases in Suena from the provided text.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Taba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taba, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that Taba has both prepositions and a postposition, with the postposition marking nouns as locative while prepositions mark a variety of other roles.
2. **Paragraph 19** lists four prepositions: ada (comitative/instrumental), pake (instrumental), untuk (beneficiary), and lo (similative). These prepositions are used to mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases.
3. **Paragraph 14** discusses the placement of various arguments in sentences and mentions that some arguments can be marked by adpositions.
4. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of noun phrases in different syntactic roles, including as objects of a postposition (locative).

From this information, it is clear that Taba uses adpositions (both prepositions and a postposition) to mark certain roles such as locative, instrumental, comitative, and beneficiary. However, there is no mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns that would indicate a more extensive system of morphological case-marking. Instead, the use of adpositions suggests that Taba relies on these particles to mark specific semantic roles rather than having a fully developed inflectional case system.

Given this evidence, Taba fits the description of a language with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete (or ""peripheral,"" or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tagalog,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tagalog, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes the three forms or markers for marked nouns: the ang form, the ng form, and the sa form. Each form indicates different sentence functions:
   - **Ang form**: Used for predicates or topics.
   - **Ng form**: Used for verb complements or possessive modifiers.
   - **Sa form**: Used for verb complements, possessive predicates or modifiers, and other contexts.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph reiterates that Tagalog has three types of marked nominals (personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns) and that each of these occurs in one of three different forms according to its function in the sentence.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides a chart of personal pronouns in Tagalog, showing that each pronoun has three forms: ang form, ng form, and sa form.

4. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the actor complement, object complement, and directional complement in basic sentences. It specifies that:
   - The actor complement is expressed by a ng phrase.
   - The object complement is expressed by an ang phrase.
   - The directional complement is expressed by a sa phrase.

5. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph mentions that the sa forms of personal pronouns are never enclitic, while the ang forms are enclitic when used as topics, and the ng forms are enclitic as actor complements and possessive modifiers.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Tagalog has a productive case-marking system with three distinct cases:
- **Nominative (ang form)**: Used for subjects and topics.
- **Genitive (ng form)**: Used for possessive modifiers and verb complements.
- **Oblique (sa form)**: Used for directional complements and other oblique functions.

### Conclusion:
**3 cases**",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Tukang Besi as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the use of the term ""subject"" and ""object"" in Tukang Besi, and mentions the nominative case marker ""na"" and the non-nominative core article ""te"". This suggests a nominative-accusative alignment in the language.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions nominative arguments and nominative case, indicating the presence of a nominative case.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the genitive article ""nu"" and its distribution, indicating the presence of a genitive case.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Provides a table showing the use of articles and prepositions for various roles, including agent, dative, instrumental, patient, locative, allative, ablative, and cause. This suggests a rich system of case-marking for various semantic roles.

5. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the oblique case marker ""i"" and its use with prepositions, indicating the presence of an oblique case.

6. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions core arguments marked by articles ""na"" and ""te"", and the use of genitive phrases, supporting the presence of nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.

7. **Paragraph 16**: Summarizes the use of nominative ""na"" and non-nominative ""te"" articles, reinforcing the nominative-accusative distinction.

8. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses object suffixes and their impact on case-marking, indicating a complex interaction between verbal morphology and case-marking.

9. **Paragraph 19**: Differentiates articles and prepositions, mentioning the core articles ""na"" and ""te"", and the oblique article ""i"", suggesting a clear distinction between core and oblique cases.

From these observations, it is clear that Tukang Besi has a productive case-marking system that includes at least nominative, accusative (non-nominative core), genitive, and oblique cases. Additionally, the presence of specific markers for roles such as dative, instrumental, locative, allative, and ablative suggests a more extensive case system.

### Conclusion:
**6-7 cases**",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Una,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Una, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: Used to mark the subject of an intransitive verb (Paragraph 4).
2. **Genitive**: Indicates possession and is prefixed to a noun (Paragraph 5).
3. **Locative**: Indicates location, both exterior/adessive ('at/on') and interior/inessive ('in/within') (Paragraph 5).
4. **Allative**: Indicates direction towards ('to, towards') (Paragraph 2).
5. **Instrumental**: Indicates means or accompaniment ('with, by') (Paragraph 17).
6. **Ergative**: Marks the agent of a transitive verb (Paragraph 7).
7. **Dative**: Marks the indirect object of the verb (Paragraph 10).
8. **Referential**: Used for marking benefactee or reference ('for', 'concerning/about/regarding') (Paragraph 3).
9. **Reflexive**: Indicates co-referentiality within the sentence ('-self') (Paragraph 9).

The presence of these nine distinct cases suggests that Una has a relatively complex case system. Each case is used productively to mark different syntactic and semantic relationships within the sentence.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly lists and describes the usage of nine different cases.
- Each case has a specific function and is marked by distinct morphological markers.
- The cases cover a wide range of syntactic roles, including subject, object, possession, location, direction, means, agent, indirect object, benefactee, and reflexivity.

**Conclusion**: 8-9 cases",no morphological case-marking,8-9 cases
Usan,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case marking in Usan. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses possessive pronouns and possessive constructions. The possessive pronoun precedes the possessed noun, and there is mention of possessive pronouns being obligatory in certain contexts. This indicates a genitive case.

2. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions the Beneficiary (Ben) marked with the postposition -t and the Instrument (Ins) also marked with -t. This suggests the presence of specific markers for these roles, which can be considered as separate cases.

3. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the oblique object marker -t used for instruments and other oblique roles. This further supports the presence of an instrumental case.

4. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions postpositions for comitative relations, specifically nob and ten, meaning 'with'. This suggests the presence of a comitative case.

5. **Paragraph 7**: Indicates that Usan is postpositional, which aligns with the use of postpositions to mark certain case roles.

6. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the genitive preceding the noun, which aligns with the genitive case marking.

From these observations, we can identify the following cases in Usan:

- **Genitive**: Indicated by possessive pronouns and possessive constructions.
- **Beneficiary**: Marked by the postposition -t.
- **Instrumental**: Also marked by the postposition -t.
- **Comitative**: Marked by postpositions nob and ten.

Given the presence of these distinct case markers, Usan appears to have a productive case system with at least four cases: genitive, beneficiary, instrumental, and comitative.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,4 cases
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the lack of case marking on nouns for core grammatical relations (subject and object). Instead, these relations are indicated by verbal prefixes.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions the oblique suffix -n/-nan, which is used to mark a range of peripheral, adverbial-like case uses such as instruments, locatives, and temporals.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Talks about the dative affixes used with ditransitive verbs to express the indirect object or dative case. For third person, there is a distinct set of dative suffixes.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Reiterates that Yimas lacks case marking on nominals functioning as core arguments, and instead uses pronominal affixes on verbs to signal grammatical relations.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of pronominal affixes on verbs indicating core grammatical relations, further emphasizing the absence of case marking on nouns for these relations.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the use of pronominal affixes and the lack of case marking on nouns for core arguments.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the use of pronominal prefixes for core arguments and the lack of case marking on nouns.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Mentions the use of pronominal prefixes for core arguments and the absence of case marking on nouns.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the use of pronominal prefixes for core arguments and the lack of case marking on nouns.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions the use of pronominal prefixes for core arguments and the absence of case marking on nouns.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses the use of pronominal prefixes for core arguments and the lack of case marking on nouns.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Yimas does not have morphological case marking for core grammatical relations (subject and object). It uses pronominal affixes on verbs to indicate these relations. The only case marking present is the oblique suffix -n/-nan, which is used for peripheral, adverbial-like functions such as instruments, locatives, and temporals. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Yimas is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the productive case paradigms of nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses reflexive clauses and the use of double pronouns but does not provide a full inventory of cases.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the specificity marker -na and its use in various constructions but does not provide a comprehensive list of cases.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses the use of plural pronouns and the potential for a second person plural clusivity distinction but does not provide a full inventory of cases.

**Reasoning**:
The paragraphs provided do not give a comprehensive list of all the productive case paradigms of nouns in Duna. However, they do mention specific markers such as the contrasted subject (CS) marker -ka, the possessor/beneficiary postposition -ya, and the locative marker -ta. These markers suggest that Duna has some form of case marking, but the information is not sufficient to determine the exact number of cases. Given the mention of specific markers and the lack of a full inventory, it is reasonable to conclude that Duna has overt marking for concrete case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, but not a fully developed case system.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system of Taiap as follows:

1. **Ergative Case**:
   - Taiap has an ergative case marker that is optionally used to mark the subject (A) of a transitive verb. This is evident from multiple examples where the ergative clitic is used to disambiguate the subject in transitive constructions (Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 16).
   - The ergative case markers are clitics that attach to the last element in a noun phrase and encode gender and number (Paragraph 4).

2. **Peripheral Cases**:
   - Taiap also has several peripheral cases, including locative, ablative, perlative, and dative, which are used to mark various oblique arguments (Paragraph 5, 7, 8, 18).
   - These peripheral cases are clitics that attach to the last element of a noun phrase and cover a wide range of semantic roles such as location, direction, instrument, companionship, and purpose (Paragraph 7, 8).

3. **Locative Case**:
   - The locative case in Taiap has a broad semantic scope, covering relationships expressed in other languages by allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal, and durative cases (Paragraph 7).

4. **Ablative Case**:
   - The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place, or object, or an action of revelation (Paragraph 7).

5. **Perlative Case**:
   - The perlative case expresses movement along, through, or by means of (Paragraph 7).

6. **Dative Case**:
   - The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison, and other relations (Paragraph 7).

7. **Possessive Case**:
   - The possessive case marks possession, association, and part-whole relationships (Paragraph 7).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Taiap exhibits a system where the ergative case is used for marking the subject of transitive verbs, and several peripheral cases (locative, ablative, perlative, dative, and possessive) are used for marking various oblique arguments. These peripheral cases are clitics that attach to the last element of a noun phrase. Given the presence of these peripheral cases and the ergative case, Taiap falls under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Mian,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states: ""Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather, verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause."" This indicates that Mian does not have morphological case-marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 5** further supports this by stating: ""Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked."" This reinforces the absence of morphological case-marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 13** mentions: ""The subject noun phrase is not overtly case-marked."" This confirms that subjects, like objects, are not marked for case.

4. **Paragraph 16** discusses locative adjuncts and states that they are not marked by determiners or other case markers, further indicating the lack of morphological case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 14** on attributive possession does not mention any case-marking for possessors, suggesting that possession is indicated by word order rather than morphological case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Mian does not exhibit morphological case-marking on nouns.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Inanwatan,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in Inanwatan:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions oblique forms for personal pronouns used for peripheral functions in the clause, which are likely derived from postpositions. This suggests some form of case marking for peripheral roles but does not provide evidence of a full-fledged case system for core grammatical relations like subject and object.

2. **Paragraph 9** distinguishes between core nominals (subject and object) and peripheral nominals. Core nominals are unmarked and distinguished by word order, while peripheral nominals take postpositions. This indicates that core grammatical relations are not marked by morphological case but by word order, and peripheral roles are marked by postpositions.

3. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of subject and object prefixes on verbs, further supporting that core grammatical relations are marked on the verb rather than on the nouns themselves.

4. **Paragraph 15** discusses peripheral question words marked by postpositions, reinforcing the idea that peripheral roles are marked by postpositions rather than by morphological case on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 19** mentions the use of a topic marker that cliticizes to the head of the relative clause, which is not directly related to case marking but shows the use of clitics for specific functions.

From these observations, it is clear that Inanwatan does not use morphological case marking for core grammatical relations (subject and object), which are instead distinguished by word order and verbal prefixes. Peripheral roles are marked by postpositions, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in Abui:

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that ""Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or gender are not found in Abui."" This indicates that Abui does not have morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 18** reinforces this by stating, ""As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection."" This further confirms the absence of morphological case-marking.

3. **Paragraph 13** discusses possessive prefixes but does not mention any other forms of case marking.

4. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 2** discuss pronominal prefixes and their roles in marking possessors and arguments but do not indicate any case-marking system for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 6** provides an overview of grammatical categories and mentions that nouns do not inflect for case.

Given these points, it is clear that Abui lacks a productive case-marking system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awtuw,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several case markers: Object (0), Instrumental (I), Possessive (P), Locative (L), and Vocative (V). This suggests that Awtuw has at least five distinct cases.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of case marking on nouns and pronouns, including the Object suffix (-re/-te), the Locative suffix (-ke), and the Possessive suffix (-ke). This further supports the presence of at least these three cases.

3. **Paragraph 3** elaborates on the Object case, indicating its obligatory use in certain contexts and its forms (-re/-te for nouns and -e for personal pronouns). This reinforces the presence of the Object case.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the Locative suffix (-ke) and its use with different classes of pronouns, confirming the Locative case.

5. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** mention that subjects never bear case marking and that there are other nouns that do not bear case marking either, which implies a nominative-accusative alignment where the subject (nominative) is unmarked.

6. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** provide further examples of possessive constructions and their marking, confirming the Possessive case.

7. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss additional morphological properties and constraints on case marking, but do not introduce new cases beyond those already identified.

8. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** reiterate the use of the Object and Possessive cases, and the absence of case marking on subjects.

From the information provided, we can conclude that Awtuw has at least the following cases:
- Nominative (unmarked for subjects)
- Accusative/Object (marked with -re/-te/-e)
- Instrumental (marked with -k)
- Possessive (marked with -ke)
- Locative (marked with -ke)

Given this information, Awtuw has a total of 5 productive cases.

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",5 cases,5 cases
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, there is no clear evidence of a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, such as pronouns, word order, noun types, possessive constructions, and spatial nouns, but there is no mention of case markers that indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

Here are some key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: Possession is indicated by bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and by possessive verbs for alienable nouns (Paragraph 1, Paragraph 15).
2. **Word Order**: The word order in noun phrases is specified, but there is no mention of case markers (Paragraph 3).
3. **Pronouns**: Both free and bound pronouns are discussed, but these are related to subject and object marking rather than case marking on nouns (Paragraph 8).
4. **Spatial Nouns**: Locative phrases are formed using prepositions and spatial nouns, not case markers (Paragraph 16).

Given the absence of explicit case markers and the reliance on word order, possessive constructions, and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships, it is reasonable to conclude that Mpur does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mehek,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses pronouns and their distinctions in gender and number but does not mention case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: States that subjects and objects are not marked for their role in the clause, except for personal pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Explicitly mentions that there is no inflectional morphology on nouns.
4. **Paragraph 16**: Describes the locative/instrumental clitic =k, which functions as a case marker for locative and instrumental meanings.

From these observations, it is clear that Mehek does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The only marking that could be considered case-like is the locative/instrumental clitic =k, which is used for specific semantic roles rather than syntactic ones. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete case relations like locatives or instrumentals.

### Reasoning:
- **No morphological case-marking on nouns**: Paragraphs explicitly state the absence of inflectional morphology on nouns.
- **Presence of a locative/instrumental clitic**: This clitic marks specific semantic roles but does not constitute a full case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that all Abun pronouns are invariant in form, irrespective of their grammatical role (subject, object, or possessor). This suggests a lack of morphological case-marking for pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 3**: It states that grammatical relations in Abun are marked by word order for subjects and objects, and by prepositions for indirect objects and obliques. This indicates that Abun does not use morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations.

3. **Paragraph 4**: It reiterates that subjects and objects in Abun are encoded by word order alone, with no case-marking or other coding devices.

4. **Paragraph 5**: It discusses prepositional phrases filling dative, locative, instrumental, and other adjunct positions, indicating that these roles are marked by prepositions rather than morphological case.

5. **Paragraph 9**: It highlights that Abun is an isolating language with very little affixation, and that grammatical relations are defined by word order and prepositions rather than affixation.

6. **Paragraph 8**: It mentions that possessive phrases in Abun do not undergo morphological change and that possession is indicated by a linker rather than affixation.

From these points, it is clear that Abun does not employ morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations (subject, object) or for possessive constructions. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations. The use of prepositions for roles such as dative, locative, and instrumental suggests that these are not marked by morphological cases either.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Based on the provided paragraphs, Koasati exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Nominative case**: Marked by the suffix -k.
2. **Accusative case**: Marked by the suffix -in.
3. **Locative case**: Marked by the suffix -fa.
4. **Allative case**: Marked by the suffix -fon.
5. **Inessive case**: Marked by the suffix -hayo.
6. **Vocative case**: Marked by deleting the final vowel of the noun or the segment -ka if it ends in that.

Additionally, the autonomous case is mentioned, which is the form of the noun used in citations and has no suffix.

From the information given, Koasati has a productive case system with six distinct cases: nominative, accusative, locative, allative, inessive, and vocative. The autonomous form is not counted as a separate case since it is used for citation and does not function as a grammatical case in the traditional sense.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative, accusative, locative, allative, inessive, and vocative cases are explicitly mentioned with their respective markers.
- The autonomous form is not considered a grammatical case but rather a citation form.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Maricopa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maricopa, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that case relations are expressed through case marking on the noun and agreement on the verb, specifically mentioning subject and object cases.
2. **Paragraph 7** provides a list of noun case markers in Maricopa:
   - **-sh** for subject, predicate noun
   - **0** (zero-marked) for object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject predicate nominal, and nominalized clauses
   - **-m** for comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topic of', 'by way of' directional
   - **-li** for locative (at) and illative (to/toward)
   - **-ly** for locative (in/on) and illative (into/to)
   - **-k** for general locative and directional

From this information, we can identify the following cases:
- **Subject case** marked by **-sh**
- **Object case** marked by **0** (zero-marked)
- **Comitative/Instrumental case** marked by **-m**
- **Locative/Illative case** marked by **-li** and **-ly**
- **General locative/directional case** marked by **-k**

This gives us a total of six distinct cases:
1. Subject
2. Object
3. Comitative/Instrumental
4. Locative (at)
5. Illative (to/toward)
6. General locative/directional

Given this information, Maricopa has a total of six to seven cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Sierra Miwok, we can identify several distinct cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: Mentioned in Paragraphs 5, 6, and 8. It is described as having a zero form in certain environments and is used for subjects of verbs.
2. **Accusative Case**: Described in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. It is used for direct objects and has the form ||-j||.
3. **Instrumental Case**: Mentioned in Paragraphs 3, 4, and 8. It is used to indicate the means by which an action is performed.
4. **Temporal Case**: Described in Paragraph 3. It has the form ||-n|| and is used to indicate time-related meanings.
5. **Genitive Case**: Mentioned in Paragraphs 12 and 13. It has forms ||-y|| and ||-n°-|| and is used to indicate possession.
6. **Locative Case**: Described in Paragraph 17. It has the form ||-m|| and is used to indicate location.

From this information, we can conclude that Southern Sierra Miwok has at least six distinct productive cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, temporal, genitive, and locative.

### Reasoning:
- **Nominative Case**: Identified by its zero form in specific environments and its use for subjects.
- **Accusative Case**: Clearly marked with ||-j|| and used for direct objects.
- **Instrumental Case**: Used to indicate means and marked with specific suffixes.
- **Temporal Case**: Specifically mentioned with a distinct form and function related to time.
- **Genitive Case**: Used for possession with distinct forms.
- **Locative Case**: Used to indicate location with a specific suffix.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Nez Perce,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information about case marking in Nez Perce:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the ergative case and direct object marking, indicating the presence of at least two cases.
2. **Paragraph 3** refers to genitive and subject cases, suggesting additional cases beyond ergative and direct object.
3. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that there is no dative case in Nez Perce, but mentions patient and dative direct objects marked by -ne.
4. **Paragraph 6** discusses the ablative case marker -kin'ix, indicating another distinct case.
5. **Paragraph 7** mentions ergative marking for subjects of transitive verbs and the use of the suffix -ne for direct objects.
6. **Paragraph 15** refers to the genitive case being promoted to direct object status in certain constructions.
7. **Paragraph 16** mentions locative goals marked by specific suffixes.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Nez Perce:
- **Ergative** (for subjects of transitive verbs)
- **Direct Object** (marked by -ne)
- **Genitive** (promoted to direct object in some contexts)
- **Ablative** (marked by -kin'ix)
- **Locative** (indicated by specific suffixes)

This gives us a total of five distinct cases: Ergative, Direct Object, Genitive, Ablative, and Locative.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oneida, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns in the language.

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that semantic roles such as agent, patient, instrumental, beneficiary, possessive, theme, or experiencer are typically encoded in the pronominal prefixes of the verb rather than in the noun morphology. It also specifies that possessives and locatives are exceptions that are marked in the noun morphology.

2. **Paragraph 9** discusses possessive prefixes and noun suffixes, including locative suffixes. The locative suffixes are described in detail, indicating that they are used to mark spatial relations on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 17** lists various noun suffixes, including locative, plural, populative, customary, augment, decessive, and characterizer suffixes. The locative suffixes are particularly noted for their role in marking spatial relations.

4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 12** describe noun incorporation and the use of instrumental derivational suffixes, indicating that certain roles can be marked on nouns through incorporation and derivational processes.

From this information, it is clear that Oneida does not have a fully productive case system for marking syntactic relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc., on nouns. Instead, it uses pronominal prefixes on verbs to encode many of these roles. However, there are specific suffixes for marking locative relations on nouns, which suggests some degree of case marking for spatial relations.

Given the presence of locative suffixes and the lack of a broader productive case system for other syntactic roles, the most appropriate classification for Oneida is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This classification acknowledges the presence of locative markers while recognizing that the language does not have a fully developed case system for other grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"To determine the number of cases in Southeastern Pomo, we need to look for explicit mentions of case markers and their functions. Here are the relevant observations from the provided paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions suffixes like ""-it"" and ""-baq"" but does not provide clear information on their functions or how many distinct cases they represent.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Lists various suffixes and postpositions indicating locative, instrumental, and other relations, suggesting a system of case marking.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Provides examples of benefactive case marking with the suffix ""-itib"".
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses possession with suffixes like ""-baq"" and mentions locative suffixes.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Lists examples of locative and other case-like suffixes.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions dual and plural suffixes but not directly related to case marking.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses interrogative enclitics and motion verbs, not directly related to case marking.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Provides a detailed list of suffixes for different grammatical relations, including benefactive and possessive.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions syntactic transformations but not directly related to case marking.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses locative suffixes in the context of interrogative sentences.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions concordance rules for non-singular NPs, not directly related to case marking.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses dual and plural suffixes again.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions syntactic rules for generating noun phrases.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses verb morphology and suffixes for actions.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses suffixes for simultaneous actions.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses verb morphology and suffixes.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses causative transformations.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions possessive markers and agreement rules.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses noun phrase expansion rules.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Provides examples of reflexive actions.

From these observations, we can infer that Southeastern Pomo has a system of case marking that includes at least the following:

- **Benefactive case**: Marked by the suffix ""-itib"".
- **Possessive case**: Marked by the suffix ""-baq"".
- **Locative case**: Various locative suffixes are mentioned.

Given the presence of these distinct case markers, Southeastern Pomo appears to have a productive case system with at least three cases: benefactive, possessive, and locative.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has explicit suffixes for different grammatical relations, indicating a productive case system.
- The examples provided show distinct case markers for benefactive, possessive, and locative functions.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",6-7 cases,3 cases
Slave,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in the Slave language. The information primarily focuses on pronouns, verb inflections, and the use of postpositions, but does not indicate a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language appears to rely on other grammatical mechanisms such as pronouns and verb inflections to indicate relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the major lexical categories (nouns, verbs, postpositions) and their inflections but does not mention case-marking for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Focuses on pronouns and their grammatical relations to verbs, without mentioning noun case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Describes the use of pronouns with verbs and the conditions under which they appear, again without reference to noun case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Talks about incorporated postpositions and their role in sentences, but does not indicate that these function as case markers for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions complementizers and adverbial elements, not relevant to noun case-marking.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses classifiers and their historical and phonological aspects, not related to noun case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Describes the use of classifiers and reflexive pronouns, with no mention of noun case-marking.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Focuses on object nouns and pronouns in verb subcategorization, without indicating a case system for nouns.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses gender marking and thematic roles, not noun case-marking.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Talks about direct objects and incorporated postpositions, not noun case-marking.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Describes possessive pronouns and coreference, not noun case-marking.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions uninflected stems used as modifiers, not noun case-marking.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses postpositions potentially being reanalyzed as conjunctions, not noun case-marking.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Talks about coreferential interpretations within sentences, not noun case-marking.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Describes compound nouns and their phonological patterns, not noun case-marking.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses coreference and thematic roles, not noun case-marking.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Describes the use of classifiers in various verb forms, not noun case-marking.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses verb themes and their relation to number, not noun case-marking.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions complementizers and their usage, not noun case-marking.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Describes thematic roles and verb themes, not noun case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Squamish, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** clearly mentions two case forms: Absolutive and Relative. The Absolutive case is unmarked (zero-marked), while the Relative case is marked by a prefix /t-/. The Absolutive case is used for subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs, while the Relative case is used for other relations.

2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that both subjects and objects are in the Absolutive case, and other relata appear in the Relative case.

3. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss the structure of sentences and the use of articles, but they do not introduce any additional cases beyond Absolutive and Relative.

4. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** provide examples of nominal expressions and the use of articles but do not indicate any further case distinctions.

5. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss relator-verbs and their complements, which are in the Relative case, confirming the two-case system.

6. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the use of clitics and substitutes but do not introduce any new cases.

7. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** discuss the nominalizer /s-/ and possessive affixes, but these are not additional cases.

8. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the use of substitutes and personal affixes, again confirming the two-case system without introducing additional cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Squamish has a two-case system: Absolutive and Relative.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case system in Tunica as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and the determinative, with the determinative further subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

3. **Paragraph 5** provides more detail on these cases:
   - The definitive case requires the use of gender-number suffixes.
   - The non-definitive case does not use any inflectional suffixes.
   - The locative case is expressed by one of three locative suffixes.

4. **Paragraph 6** describes the syntactic functions of nouns in these cases, confirming their usage in various syntactic roles.

5. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 8** further elaborate on the locative suffixes and their exclusivity with gender-number suffixes.

From this information, it is clear that Tunica has three productive case categories for nouns: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative. The locative case is marked by specific suffixes, while the definitive case is marked by gender-number suffixes, and the non-definitive case is unmarked.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Washo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions the contrast between Third Person Subjective and Objective pronouns, which is equivalent to the contrast between subjective and objective nouns. This suggests that there is a distinction made in the language similar to nominative and accusative cases.

2. **Paragraph 11** discusses the derivation of adverbs from nouns, pronouns, and other categories using a set of suffixed postpositions that have meanings analogous to English prepositions. This indicates the presence of locative or instrumental markers, which are often considered peripheral cases.

3. **Paragraph 18** mentions that the semantic relationship of the verb to the noun differs from case to case, implying that there are multiple case distinctions in the language.

From the information provided, it is clear that Washo has at least two cases (subjective and objective) and also uses suffixed postpositions for locative or instrumental meanings. This suggests that Washo has a system of case marking that includes both core grammatical relations (such as nominative and accusative) and peripheral relations (such as locative or instrumental).

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Washo would be ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it appears to have overt marking primarily for peripheral case relations like locatives or instrumentals, rather than a full-fledged case system with multiple core grammatical cases.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wichita,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wichita, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions various roles such as experiencer, beneficiary, and agent but does not provide evidence of morphological case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 3** refers to instrumental suffixes and indirect objects but does not indicate a productive case system.
3. **Paragraph 4** includes terms like ""locative"" and ""dative"" but these seem to be more about roles rather than morphological cases.
4. **Paragraph 6** discusses number and person distinctions in verbs but does not mention case marking on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 7** lists relationships like experiencer, beneficiary, and instrument but again, no morphological case marking is indicated.
6. **Paragraph 10** mentions locative and dative forms but these appear to be more about verb agreement or prepositional phrases rather than noun case marking.
7. **Paragraph 17** includes examples of imperative and dative forms but these are related to verb forms and pronouns, not noun cases.

From the information provided, it is clear that Wichita does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The roles and relationships mentioned are expressed through other means such as verb agreement, prepositions, or word order rather than morphological case marking on nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wintu, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Object case**: {um}
2. **Genitive case**: {un}
3. **Locative case**: {in}
4. **Instrumental case**: {r}
5. **Possessive case**: {t}

### Reasoning:

- **Paragraph 1** lists several case suffixes: object ({um}), genitive ({un}), locative ({in}), instrumental ({r}), and possessive ({t}).
- **Paragraph 2** confirms that nouns are inflected for three morphological cases and mentions that pronouns are marked for three cases.
- **Paragraph 3** indicates that inalienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, possessive, and instrumental, while alienably possessed nouns use the genitive for possessive and instrumental functions.
- **Paragraph 4** mentions that pronouns distinguish six cases, including subject, object, dependent possessive, independent possessive, instrumental, and locative.
- **Paragraph 5** provides examples of the locative case suffix {in} and mentions the instrumental case suffix {r}.
- **Paragraph 8** reiterates the four case suffixes: object ({um}), possessive ({t}), instrumental ({r}), and locative ({in}).
- **Paragraph 11** states that alienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, genitive, and locative.
- **Paragraph 12** describes the object case suffix {um}.
- **Paragraph 14** provides examples of the genitive case suffix {un}.
- **Paragraph 18** gives examples of the genitive case suffix {un} and mentions the locative case suffix {in}.

From the information provided, it is clear that Wintu has a productive case system with at least five distinct cases: object, genitive, locative, instrumental, and possessive.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Acoma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Acoma, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 3**: It explicitly states that ""Nouns do not distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for a possessor, with distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession."" This indicates that there is no morphological case-marking for nouns in Acoma.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the roles of actor and undergoer, which correspond to subject and object roles in sentences. However, it does not mention any morphological case-marking for these roles, suggesting that these roles are likely marked by other means, such as word order or verbal inflection.

3. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the possessive copula and its use with nouns and noun phrases, but does not mention any case-marking.

4. **Paragraph 2**: Provides an example of possession expressed through an appositional construction involving a nominalized verb stem, not through case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20**: These paragraphs do not provide any information about case-marking on nouns.

From the information provided, it is clear that Acoma does not use morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as word order, verbal inflection, and possessive constructions to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aleut, the language exhibits the following case-marking features:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ordinary nouns have suffixes for relational case (absolutive, relative).
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the locative case and mentions the dative, which has only locative forms.
3. **Paragraph 8** explicitly states that Aleut has two grammatical (relational) cases: absolutive and relative. It also mentions two local cases: locative and ablative.
4. **Paragraph 20** confirms that positional nouns have one or two adverbial cases (locative and/or ablative).

From these observations, it is clear that Aleut has a productive case system that includes at least four cases: absolutive, relative, locative, and ablative. This indicates a mid-sized inventory of cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The absolutive and relative cases are used for core grammatical relations.
- The locative and ablative cases are used for expressing spatial relations.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, there is no explicit mention of a productive case system for nouns. Instead, the text primarily discusses various nominalizers, possessive constructions, and the use of proclitics and suffixes for different grammatical functions. The locative and instrumental nominalizers mentioned are more indicative of derivational morphology rather than a productive case system.

Given the absence of clear evidence for a productive case paradigm for nouns and the presence of nominalizers that are more derivational in nature, the most appropriate classification for Barbareño Chumash would be:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Comanche,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Comanche, we can identify the following relevant information regarding case marking:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the objective case marking with various suffixes like -@, -?a, -ha, -i, -e, and -ta. It also mentions the absolutive suffix -pi.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions subjective, objective, and possessive case marking for pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Confirms the presence of subjective, objective, and possessive forms for nouns and pronouns.
4. **Paragraph 6**: States that the subject is in subjective case and the object in objective case in transitive sentences.
5. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions possessive case marking with a fortis final feature.
6. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the inflection of nouns and pronouns for subjective, objective, and possessive cases.
7. **Paragraph 13**: Provides examples of relative clauses where the subject is in subjective case and the object in objective case.
8. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses possessive case marking in relative clauses.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Comanche has a productive case system that includes at least the following cases:
- **Subjective case**: Used for subjects of sentences.
- **Objective case**: Used for objects of sentences.
- **Possessive case**: Used to indicate possession.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, Comanche has **3 cases**: subjective, objective, and possessive.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",3 cases,3 cases
Kiowa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kiowa, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. The evidence points towards the use of pronominal prefixes and other morphological devices to indicate relationships and roles within sentences, rather than a system of nominal case marking.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1:** Discusses possessive constructions and pronominal relationships but does not mention any case markers.
   - **Paragraph 3:** Focuses on pronominal prefixes and their roles in indicating number and person, without reference to case marking.
   - **Paragraph 4:** Mentions locative and other relational expressions but does not provide evidence of a case system.
   - **Paragraph 7:** Describes the use of pronominal prefixes to indicate roles such as agent and patient, suggesting that these roles are marked on the verb rather than the noun.
   - **Paragraph 9:** Discusses the structure of noun phrases and relative clauses without mentioning case marking.
   - **Paragraph 10:** Describes the use of pronominal prefixes and verb morphology to indicate relationships, again without reference to nominal case marking.
   - **Paragraph 12:** Mentions the use of inverse suffixes to indicate number distinctions but does not provide evidence of a case system.
   - **Paragraph 13:** Discusses nominal modification and compounding, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 15:** Mentions nominal suffixes for demonstratives but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 17:** Describes the use of pronominal prefixes and object markers, without reference to nominal case marking.
   - **Paragraph 19:** Discusses tonal and phonological features of nouns, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 20:** Mentions interrogative and locative constructions but does not provide evidence of a case system.

Given the absence of any explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns and the reliance on pronominal prefixes and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relationships, it is reasonable to conclude that Kiowa does not have morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Yup'ik, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Absolutive Case**: Used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs.
2. **Relative Case**: Used for the subject of transitive verbs and possessors.
3. **Ablative-Modalis Case**: Used for indicating the place from which motion occurs and for indefinite objects.
4. **Terminalis Case**: Used for indicating the place to which motion occurs.
5. **Localis Case**: Used for indicating the place at which something occurs.
6. **Vialis Case**: Used for indicating the route or means by which something occurs.
7. **Equalis Case**: Used for indicating similarity or likeness.

From these paragraphs, we can infer that Central Yup'ik has at least seven distinct productive cases. The cases mentioned cover a range of syntactic and semantic functions, including core grammatical relations (subject, object, possessor) and various locative and instrumental relations.

### Reasoning:
- **Absolutive and Relative Cases**: These are core syntactic cases used for subjects and objects, as well as possessors.
- **Ablative-Modalis, Terminalis, and Localis Cases**: These are locative cases indicating various spatial relations.
- **Vialis and Equalis Cases**: These are instrumental and comparative cases, respectively.

Given the presence of these seven cases, Central Yup'ik falls into the category of languages with six to seven cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""Locative inflections prefixed to nouns,"" indicating the presence of locative case marking. However, it does not specify whether there are other cases or how extensive the case system is.

2. **Paragraph 9** discusses the use of prefixed forms in nouns standing as the direct object of verbs, suggesting some form of object marking, but it is not clear if this is a distinct case or a syntactic construction.

3. **Paragraph 16** mentions ""Locative forms"" and specifies that there are three locative forms. This indicates the presence of locative case marking, but again, it does not provide information on other potential cases.

4. **Paragraph 10** talks about ""Objective forms"" and ""Comitative forms,"" which suggests the presence of at least two more cases: an objective (possibly accusative) and a comitative case.

5. **Paragraph 14** describes prefixes that follow nominals to produce adverbial groups, which could be interpreted as a form of case marking, particularly for locative or directional cases.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Yurok has some form of case marking, particularly locative, objective, and comitative cases. However, the information does not indicate a comprehensive case system with a large number of cases. Instead, it suggests a limited set of cases, primarily for specific syntactic and semantic functions.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of locative, objective, and comitative forms suggests that Yurok has a small number of cases.
- The information does not indicate a fully developed case system with a wide range of syntactic roles marked by distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that pronouns are inflected for number and case.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the differentiation between subject, object, and possessive pronouns, indicating that these are distinct forms.
3. **Paragraph 5** provides a table of personal pronouns, showing distinct forms for subject, object, and possessive cases.
4. **Paragraph 10** states that nouns are inflected only for number (singular and plural), with no mention of case inflections for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 16** reiterates that nouns are inflected solely for number, and pronouns are inflected for case and number.

From this information, it is clear that Zuni has a system of case-marking for pronouns but not for nouns. The pronouns have distinct forms for subject, object, and possessive cases, but the nouns are only inflected for number (singular and plural) and not for case.

Given the definition of ""cases"" as productive case paradigms of nouns, and considering that Zuni does not have case inflections for nouns but only for pronouns, the appropriate classification for Zuni would be:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.**

This classification is chosen because Zuni has overt marking for case relations in pronouns but not in nouns, which fits the description of ""exclusively borderline case-marking"" where overt marking is limited to specific categories and not applied broadly to all nouns.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Columbia-Wenatchi, we can analyze the information to determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that agents of transitive verbs appear in the ergative case, and agents of intransitive verbs appear in the absolutive case. This indicates the presence of at least two cases: ergative and absolutive.
   
2. **Paragraph 9**: States that the agent functions as the subject of the clause and is in direct case, while the patient is in oblique case. This suggests the presence of a direct case and an oblique case.

3. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions that the locative is case-marked as the direct object. This indicates the presence of a locative case.

4. **Paragraph 12**: Refers to the ergative argument (transitive subject) being optionally marked by quirky case, with an oblique marker preceding certain nouns. This reinforces the presence of an ergative case and an oblique case.

5. **Paragraph 18**: States that the incorporated noun is not marked for case, indicating that noun incorporation does not involve case marking.

6. **Paragraph 19**: Summarizes properties of indefinite object voice, mentioning that the agent is in direct case, the patient (if present) is in direct case, and the goal is suppressed or realized as an adjunct. This indicates the presence of a direct case.

From the above information, we can identify the following cases in Columbia-Wenatchi:
- **Ergative case** (for agents of transitive verbs)
- **Absolutive case** (for agents of intransitive verbs)
- **Direct case** (mentioned in multiple contexts)
- **Oblique case** (for patients and other non-core arguments)
- **Locative case** (for marking location)

Thus, Columbia-Wenatchi exhibits a system with at least five distinct cases: ergative, absolutive, direct, oblique, and locative.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Tlingit,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the formal contrasts between different nominal phrases functioning as subject, object, indirect object, and extension. It mentions agreement with pronominal prefixes and possessive pronominals but does not indicate any distinct morphological case markers for these functions.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph outlines the general structure and functions of various word classes, including nominal and locative words. It mentions limited inflectional suffixation among nominal and locative words, suggesting that while there is some morphological marking, it is not extensive or indicative of a rich case system.

3. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph describes the nominal phrase functioning as an object, noting that it is in agreement with object pronominals in the verbal phrase. It also mentions that the nominal phrase functioning as an object is without a following syntactic marker, which implies that there are no distinct morphological case markers for objects.

4. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph summarizes the structure of nominal words, indicating that pronouns and numerals are considered simple morphologically, and that many numerals are monomorphemic. It also mentions that possessive suffixes are part of the noun structure, but there is no indication of a broader case system.

5. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses locative phrases and their agreement with non-focal or third-person object pronominals in the verbal phrase. It suggests that locative phrases are defined by their function rather than distinct morphological case markers.

6. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses verb stems and their inflectional components, indicating that morphological complexity is more prevalent in verbs than in nouns. It does not provide evidence of a rich nominal case system.

7. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the use of dubitative postmarginals and their semantic functions, which are not related to morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses paratactically linked sentences and the use of common words or phrases between clauses, which is more about syntactic structure than morphological case marking.

9. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the occurrence of multiple nominal phrases functioning as subject or object within a clause, often in juxtaposition, without indicating distinct morphological case markers.

10. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the co-occurrence of verb themes with certain phrases, again focusing on syntactic rather than morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, Tlingit does not exhibit a rich system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on agreement with pronominal prefixes and possessive pronominals, as well as syntactic markers for certain functions. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Tlingit is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the obviative form used to mark possession and subject of intransitive verbs. The obviative is a morphological marker indicating a noun's relationship to another noun or verb, particularly in terms of possession and subject-object relations.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions the obviative plural and the use of the inverse marker to indicate the relationship between proximate and obviative nouns in sentences. This suggests a system where noun forms change based on their syntactic roles.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Describes absentative forms, which indicate absence in time or space. This form is another morphological marker, although it is more about the state of being rather than syntactic function.

4. **Paragraph 8**: Explains the use of proximate and obviative markers to distinguish between animate nouns in sentences, indicating their role in the discourse.

5. **Paragraph 10**: Details locative inflection, showing how nouns can take locative endings to indicate spatial relations.

6. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the plural and obviative inflections for nouns, indicating a productive system of morphological marking for these categories.

7. **Paragraph 14**: Mentions the use of apostrophes to represent dropped consonants in various forms, including possessive and obviative forms.

8. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the hierarchy of persons and how nouns and verbs are marked for grammatical person, including possessive forms.

9. **Paragraph 20**: Describes the use of direct and inverse markers in verb forms, which are related to the syntactic roles of nouns.

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has a productive system of morphological marking for obviative, proximate, and locative cases. These markers are used to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships between nouns and verbs, as well as possession and spatial relations.

### Reasoning:
- **Obviative and Proximate**: These are clearly marked and are used to indicate the syntactic roles of nouns in sentences, particularly in distinguishing subjects and objects.
- **Locative**: The presence of locative endings indicates a productive system for marking spatial relations.
- **Possessive**: The language uses morphological markers to indicate possession, which is a common function of genitive cases in other languages.

### Conclusion:
Given the presence of these distinct morphological markers, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet can be classified as having **Exclusively borderline case-marking**. The language has overt marking for concrete case relations such as locatives and obviatives, but it does not exhibit a full-fledged case system with a wide range of syntactic functions like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the Tsimshian (Coast) language exhibits a system where pronominals are marked for ergative and absolutive cases. The language differentiates between ergative (subjects of transitive sentences) and absolutive (subjects of intransitive sentences and direct objects of transitive sentences) pronominals. However, there is no mention of additional cases such as dative, genitive, instrumental, or locative.

The paragraphs indicate that the language uses ergative and absolutive markers for pronominals, but there is no evidence of a broader case system applied to nouns beyond these two cases. The presence of ergative and absolutive pronominals suggests a minimal case system.

### Reasoning:
1. **Ergative and Absolutive Cases**: The language clearly marks ergative and absolutive cases for pronominals, indicating a distinction between subjects of transitive verbs (ergative) and subjects of intransitive verbs or direct objects of transitive verbs (absolutive).
2. **Lack of Additional Cases**: There is no mention of other cases such as dative, genitive, instrumental, or locative in the provided paragraphs, which suggests that the language does not have a more extensive case system.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nahuatl (Tetelcingo), there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses pronominal affixes, verb agreement, and other syntactic elements without mentioning specific case markers for nouns. The examples provided show various forms of noun incorporation and pronominal marking but do not indicate a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the copying of possessor pronouns and subject prefixes but does not mention case markers.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Talks about epenthesis and vowel harmony but does not provide evidence of case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions pronominal affixes on verbs, which is not indicative of noun case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 7**: Describes incorporated elements indicating relative positions but not case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 14**: Provides examples of locative and instrumental phrases but these are not part of a productive case paradigm for nouns.
6. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses honorifics and object marking on verbs, not noun case-marking.

Given the absence of clear evidence for a productive case paradigm for nouns in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is:

### Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Based on the provided paragraphs from a descriptive grammar of Abkhaz, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions pronominal affixes used to indicate functions of the noun, such as ""from me"" and ""at the river."" This suggests some form of relational marking, but it is not explicitly clear if these are cases or prepositions.

2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the use of pronominal affixes and relational particles within the verbal complex, indicating that features of the noun phrase (NP) may be coded in the verb. This implies a heavy reliance on verbal morphology rather than nominal case-marking.

3. **Paragraph 3** again emphasizes the use of pronominal affixes within the verbal complex for subjects and objects, suggesting that syntactic roles are marked on the verb rather than on the nouns themselves.

4. **Paragraph 4** describes possessive constructions and the use of possessive pronouns, but does not mention case-marking on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 5** talks about predicative case-forms and adverbial forms, but these are not indicative of a full-fledged case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns.

6. **Paragraph 6** discusses the use of pronominal affixes and relational particles in marking indirect objects and other NP types, again within the verbal complex.

7. **Paragraph 7** mentions reciprocal pronouns and possessive pronouns, but does not provide evidence of a case system for marking syntactic roles on nouns.

8. **Paragraph 8** describes number marking and the use of predicative case, but this is more about number and predication rather than a comprehensive case system.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses emphatic pronouns and their formation, which does not relate to case-marking.

10. **Paragraph 10** talks about pitch and word order, not case-marking.

11. **Paragraph 11** discusses verbal morphology and the use of particles, not nominal case-marking.

12. **Paragraph 12** describes verbal forms and potential-consecutive constructions, not nominal case-marking.

13. **Paragraph 13** mentions number marking and pluralization, not case-marking.

14. **Paragraph 14** discusses plural markers and adjectives, not case-marking.

15. **Paragraph 15** describes the use of predicative case and stative verbs, but this is not indicative of a full case system.

16. **Paragraph 16** talks about the use of predicative case in noun-complements, but this is limited to predication.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses the use of negative particles and pronominal affixes in the verbal complex, not nominal case-marking.

18. **Paragraph 18** mentions plural markers for human nouns, not case-marking.

19. **Paragraph 19** describes interrogative pronouns and their adverbial forms, not case-marking.

20. **Paragraph 20** discusses abstract nouns and deverbal nouns, not case-marking.

### Reasoning:
The provided paragraphs consistently describe a system where relational and syntactic roles are marked primarily through pronominal affixes and verbal morphology rather than through a comprehensive case system on nouns. There is mention of predicative case and possessive constructions, but these do not constitute a full-fledged case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Eastern Armenian, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative (NOM)**: The nominative case is unmarked and serves as the subject of the sentence, a direct object denoting non-persons, an adverbial modifier of location and time, a complement of the copula, or a vocative.
2. **Dative (DAT)**: The dative case has various endings depending on the declension type and serves multiple functions, including as an attribute conveying different relations (possessive, subjective, objective, origin, part of a whole), a direct object denoting a person, a complement of addressee or beneficent, and an adverbial modifier of location and time.
3. **Ablative (ABL)**: The ablative case ends in {-ic} and is used for complements of verbs of negative emotion, removal, partitive objects, agent’s complements in passive constructions, complements denoting the basis of comparison, and adverbial modifiers of cause, location, and time.
4. **Instrumental (INST)**: The instrumental case ends in {-ov} and is used for complements of verbs of contact, filling, occupation, instrument, concommitant object, agent’s complement in passive constructions, and adverbial modifiers of manner, route, time, and cause.
5. **Locative (LOC)**: The locative case ends in {-um} and is used for the second valency of verbs of residence and as an adverbial modifier of place and location in time.
6. **Genitive (GEN)**: The genitive case functions as a possessive attribute and is used with most prepositions and postpositions.

These cases are productive and cover a wide range of syntactic and semantic functions, indicating a robust case system.

**Reasoning**:
The paragraphs provide clear evidence of six distinct cases (NOM, DAT, ABL, INST, LOC, GEN) with specific morphological markers and functions. Each case is used productively in various syntactic roles, fulfilling the criteria for being considered genuine grammatical cases.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Basque,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 1**: Lists various case forms for personal pronouns, including absolutive (ABS), ergative (ERG), dative (DAT), genitive (GEN), benefactive (BEN), comitative (COM), instrumental (INSTR), locative (LOC), ablative (ABL), and allative (ALL).

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that case and number inflection in Basque is marked by suffixes and provides examples of case-marked noun phrases.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Describes the functions of the absolutive, ergative, and dative cases, and provides examples of their usage.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the local cases (locative, ablative, allative) and mentions additional compound cases formed on the allative: directional, terminative, and destinative.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Provides detailed inflectional paradigms for nouns, listing multiple cases including absolutive, ergative, dative, genitive, benefactive, comitative, instrumental, partitive, prolative, and local cases (locative, ablative, allative).

6. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the genitive case and its usage, as well as the benefactive and comitative cases.

7. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions that the verbal noun can take various inflectional suffixes, including the allative and locative case-endings.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Basque:

- Absolutive (ABS)
- Ergative (ERG)
- Dative (DAT)
- Genitive (GEN)
- Benefactive (BEN)
- Comitative (COM)
- Instrumental (INSTR)
- Locative (LOC)
- Ablative (ABL)
- Allative (ALL)
- Partitive (PRTT)
- Prolative (PRO)

This gives us a total of 12 distinct cases.

### Conclusion: 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Catalan, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that first- and second-person object pronouns in Catalan are undifferentiated for the accusative (direct object) and dative (indirect object) functions. This indicates that there is no distinct morphological case marking for these functions in pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the placement of weak object pronouns before the verb and mentions that these pronouns appear in all cases except specific exceptions. This suggests that the pronouns themselves do not change form based on case.

3. **Paragraph 11** elaborates on the range of functions of the Catalan indirect object, including the ethic dative, but does not indicate any distinct morphological case marking for these functions.

4. **Paragraph 13** explains that third-person indirect object pronouns (li for singular and els for plural) stand for both masculine and feminine indirect objects. This again points to a lack of distinct morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 20** states that other noun phrases generally take no special form as direct objects, with the preposition ""a"" used in certain contexts. This implies that case relations are often expressed through prepositions rather than morphological case marking.

From these observations, it is clear that Catalan does not have a productive system of morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order, prepositions, and pronouns that do not change form based on case.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Western Frisian, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: 
   - ""Except for the plural ending, nouns in Frisian are essentially undeclined. There are a few isolated holdovers from an earlier case system, but these are insignificant in the language today. Hence, as is true for English and Dutch also, the function of a noun in a sentence is indicated not by its case, but by its position in the sentence.""

2. **Paragraph 3**:
   - ""Certain relics of a more elaborate case system in the articles have survived into the modern language. These tend to be preserved in phrases like op ’en doer ‘eventually’; mei der tiid ‘in time’; des Heare ‘of the Lord’; te’n ein ‘finished, to the end’.""
   - ""Another relic of this nature is the use of de for the dative case of it in a few established contexts, as in it ’e hits ‘out of the house’; yn ’e Ais ‘in the house’ (cf. it his). The utilization of de in this sense is restricted almost entirely to prepositional phrases of location, most frequently with h@s or midden as the object of the preposition.""

3. **Paragraph 9**:
   - ""Neither natural gender nor grammatical gender is strictly adhered to in the choice of third person pronouns. In reference to people, hy or sy/hja is used, depending on the sex of the person, even when that person is referred to with a neuter noun: it famke hat har tas tinder ’e earm ‘the girl has her purse under the (her) arm.’ Observe that the girl is referred to as ‘her’, although it famke is grammatically neuter.""

From these points, it is clear that Western Frisian does not have a productive case system for nouns. The language primarily relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations, similar to English and Dutch. The remnants of an older case system are limited to specific, fossilized expressions and are not productive in the modern language.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Hunzib,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hunzib, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system described.

9. **Paragraph 9** describes the formation of oblique stems and mentions the ergative, genitive, and instrumental cases.
10. **Paragraph 10** discusses the use of adjectives in various cases, including nominative and oblique.
11. **Paragraph 11** mentions the adessive case.
12. **Paragraph 12** classifies the dative as a local ending.
13. **Paragraph 13** lists the order of elements in noun phrases, including genitive and instrumental pronouns.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses agreement in adjectives and verbs, mentioning the ergative case.
15. **Paragraph 15** mentions distinctions in class marking.
16. **Paragraph 16** describes the dative ending.

- Superessive
- Subessive
- Contactive
- Comitative
- Allative

This indicates that Hunzib has a rich case system with at least 10 or more productive cases.

**Reasoning:**
The paragraphs provide evidence of multiple distinct cases, including core syntactic cases (nominative, ergative, genitive, instrumental) and several local cases (dative, adessive, superessive, subessive, contactive, comitative, allative). The presence of these cases suggests a highly inflected language with a complex case system.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayah Li (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system of Kayah Li (Eastern) as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses the use of prepositions and localizers in Kayah Li, indicating that many syntactic and semantic roles are expressed through prepositional phrases rather than morphological case marking. This suggests that Kayah Li relies on prepositions for indicating relationships rather than inflectional case markers.

2. **Paragraph 2** categorizes different types of nouns and noun phrases, including common nouns, names, pronouns, classifiers, and localizers. It mentions that localizers are bound and require a preceding preposition, reinforcing the idea that spatial and relational meanings are conveyed through prepositions rather than case inflections.

3. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of noun phrases and their structures, showing that Kayah Li uses prepositions and localizers to indicate relationships such as location and possession. This further supports the lack of morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 4** describes verbs that denote bodily sensations or emotions, where the experiencer is typically post-verbal. This indicates a syntactic strategy rather than morphological case marking to denote the subject or object.

5. **Paragraph 5** discusses the grammatical relations of subject, object, and indirect object, noting that these relations are licensed by the verb and not marked by morphological cases. This suggests that Kayah Li does not use inflectional case marking for core grammatical relations.

6. **Paragraph 6** outlines the structure of noun phrases, emphasizing the use of prepositions and localizers rather than case markers to indicate relationships within the phrase.

7. **Paragraph 7** lists form classes and their functions, including nouns, classifiers, verbs, and prepositions. The description of prepositions as introducing prepositional phrases further indicates that relational meanings are expressed through prepositions rather than case inflections.

8. **Paragraph 8** mentions the lack of case marking and agreement in Kayah Li, explicitly stating that the language does not use morphological case marking.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses classifiers and their use in counting and measuring, which is unrelated to case marking but supports the idea that Kayah Li uses other strategies for grammatical functions.

10. **Paragraph 10** describes the use of prefixes and their functions, indicating that these prefixes do not serve as case markers but rather have other grammatical roles.

11. **Paragraph 11** discusses the use of argument-adding morphemes in verb complexes, which again suggests that relational meanings are handled by verb morphology and syntax rather than noun case marking.

12. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of verb complexes and their argument structures, showing that relational roles are expressed through verb morphology and syntax.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses interclausal syntax and the use of pronouns to mark relationships, further indicating that case marking is not used.

14. **Paragraph 14** examines the use of prefixes and pronouns, showing that these elements do not function as case markers.

15. **Paragraph 15** provides a typological outline of Kayah Li, explicitly stating the lack of case marking and the use of prepositions and localizers for relational meanings.

16. **Paragraph 16** describes the linear order of elements in the clause, emphasizing the use of prepositions and classifiers rather than case markers.

17. **Paragraph 17** provides a typological overview, reiterating the lack of case marking and the use of prepositions and localizers.

18. **Paragraph 18** discusses the use of pronouns and names, indicating that these elements do not carry case markings.

19. **Paragraph 19** outlines the structure of noun phrases, emphasizing the use of prepositions and localizers.

20. **Paragraph 20** describes the use of possessive constructions and localizers, further supporting the lack of case marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking

The analysis of the provided paragraphs consistently indicates that Kayah Li (Eastern) does not use morphological case marking. Instead, it relies on prepositions, localizers, and syntactic strategies to express relational meanings.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Khanty,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Khanty, the language exhibits a productive case system with the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: The unmarked form used for subjects and direct objects with certain roles.
2. **Locative**: Marked by the suffix -na, used for indicating location, direction, and other oblique functions.
3. **Translative**: Marked by the suffix -ji after a vowel and -Ci after a consonant-final stem, used to indicate transformation or change of state.

These cases are explicitly mentioned and exemplified in the text, indicating that Khanty has a productive case system with at least three distinct cases.

### Reasoning:
- **Paragraph 1**: Clearly mentions the Nominative, Locative, and Translative cases, providing specific suffixes and examples for each.
- **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the inflectional morphology of nouns, including case marking.
- **Paragraph 4**: Provides additional examples of the Locative case in use.
- **Paragraph 5**: Shows possessive constructions involving the Locative case.
- **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that personal pronouns inflect for case, including the Locative.

These cases are explicitly mentioned and described in the context of their grammatical and semantic functions. The descriptions indicate that these case markers are productive and used to indicate various syntactic and semantic relationships in sentences.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Latvian,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Latvian, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that traditionally, Latvian grammars have worked with a system of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative. However, the status of the instrumental case is questioned because it occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" (with) and is identical in form with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural. The conclusion is that modern Latvian does not have a separate instrumental case, resulting in a system of six cases.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates the functions of the six cases (genitive, accusative, dative, locative, nominative, and vocative) and mentions a small note on the instrumental, which is not considered a separate case.

3. **Paragraph 10** supports the view that the instrumental case is not necessary to consider due to its merger with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural.

From these points, it is clear that the productive case paradigm in modern Latvian consists of six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and vocative. The instrumental case is not considered a separate productive case due to its limited and merged usage.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can determine the number of cases in the language. The most relevant information is found in Paragraph 2, which explicitly states:

> ""There are eighteen cases in Lezgian: four grammatical ones (Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, Dative) and fourteen local cases divided into five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In), each of which has three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive). One combination, the 'In-Directive', is missing, so there are only 3 × 5 - 1 = 14 combinations.""

This paragraph clearly enumerates the cases in Lezgian, listing both the grammatical and local cases. The four grammatical cases are Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, and Dative. The fourteen local cases are derived from combinations of five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In) with three locative forms (Essive, Elative, Directive), minus one missing combination (In-Directive).

### Conclusion:
**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Meithei,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meithei, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Lists the following case markers: agentive/instrumental (-na), accusative (-pu), locative (-ta), ablative (-tegi), genitive (-ki), and associative (-ka).
   - This indicates at least six distinct cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Discusses the genitive case (-ki) and mentions that a noun phrase marked by the genitive case may be further marked by the locative or associative, indicating compositional meaning.
   - This reinforces the presence of the genitive case and its interaction with other cases.

3. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Mentions peripheral case markers: locative (-ta), instrumental (-na), associative (-ka), and ablative (-tagi).
   - This confirms the presence of these cases.

4. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Discusses the role of morphological case marking in indicating grammatical relations and semantic roles, suggesting a system where case marking is significant.

5. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Mentions the agentive case (-na) and its distinction from a homophonous contrastive marker (-nd), indicating the importance of the agentive case.

6. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Lists enclitics used to indicate semantic roles: agent (-m), actor (-0), experiencer/goal (-te), path (-0), patient (-pu), and theme (-0).
   - This suggests a system where multiple roles are marked, though some may overlap or be zero-marked.

7. **Paragraph 12**:
   - Confirms that case is an inflectional category for nouns in Meithei.

8. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Mentions that case markers occur to the left of determiners, indicating their syntactic role.

9. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Provides examples of possessive pronouns formed through the genitive case (-ki).

10. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Discusses the use of demonstrative pronouns with case markers, indicating their flexibility and integration into the case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Meithei has a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: agentive/instrumental, accusative, locative, ablative, genitive, and associative. Therefore, the number of cases in Meithei falls within the range of **6-7 cases**.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mundari,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mundari, the following observations can be made regarding the case-marking system:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions case markers in the context of a sentence, indicating that Mundari has some form of case marking.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of possessive constructions and mentions forms like ""diri-rea?/ra?"" (of the stone) and ""ora?—rea?/re?"" (of the house), suggesting a genitive case.
3. **Paragraph 9** discusses postpositions such as ""re"" (in), ""te"" (to), ""ate/ete"" (from), ""sa?"" (on the side), ""ta?"" (vicinity), and ""lo?"" (with), which are used to express various semantic functions. This indicates that Mundari uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers for many relational functions.
4. **Paragraph 12** explicitly states that Mundari is not an inflectional language and that both the subject and object of a sentence are morphologically unmarked for case. The sentence structure relies on word order rather than case marking.
5. **Paragraph 13** discusses number marking on nouns but does not mention additional case markers beyond those already discussed.

From these observations, it is clear that Mundari primarily uses postpositions to express relational functions and does not have a rich inflectional case system. The presence of genitive-like constructions and the use of postpositions for locative and instrumental functions suggest that the language does not have a productive case paradigm but rather relies on postpositions for expressing many of these relationships.

**Reasoning:**
- The language uses postpositions extensively for locative, instrumental, and other relational functions.
- There is no evidence of a rich inflectional case system with multiple distinct cases.
- The genitive-like constructions are the only overt case markers mentioned, and they do not form a comprehensive case system.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Nivkh,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** lists various case markers including nominative, dative/accusative, locative, ablative, instrumental, and others.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that there are 8 cases in one dialect and 7 cases in another dialect.
3. **Paragraph 4** mentions the dative/accusative case, locative case, and comparative case, among others.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss the use of case suffixes with postpositions and other grammatical structures.
5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 17** provide examples of case markers being used in sentences.

From this information, it is clear that Nivkh has a productive case system with multiple distinct cases. Specifically, the mention of 8 cases in one dialect and 7 in another suggests a relatively large inventory of cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Tati (Southern),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Tati, the language exhibits a clear system of two cases: direct and oblique. This is consistently mentioned across several paragraphs, particularly in Paragraph 2, which explicitly states that Eshtehardi, a dialect of Southern Tati, has a clear system of two cases, direct and oblique. This system is also indicated to be the basic system of Southern Tati, appearing in other dialects of the group in weaker forms.

Additionally, Paragraph 4 confirms the presence of at least two cases, direct and oblique, in the nominal declension system. Paragraphs 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 15 further elaborate on the use and functions of these two cases in various syntactic roles, such as subjects, agents, objects, and possessive constructions.

Therefore, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that Southern Tati has a productive case paradigm of two cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Turkish,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkish, we can determine the number of cases in Turkish as follows:

1. **Paragraph 4** explicitly lists the cases recognized by traditional Turkish grammarians: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, and genitive. This gives us six cases.
2. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the markers for the cases are the same for pronouns and nouns in general, reinforcing the idea that these cases are consistently used across different types of nouns.
3. **Paragraph 12** discusses the instrumental ""clitic"" and its free morpheme counterpart, which some traditional grammars do not recognize as a case marker. This suggests that the instrumental is not universally accepted as a productive case in Turkish.
4. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 13** indicate that possessive pronouns can be marked for all the cases found in the language, which aligns with the six cases mentioned earlier.
5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** further confirm the use of these cases in various syntactic contexts, including finite and nonfinite clauses.

Given this information, the productive case paradigm in Turkish includes six cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, and genitive. The instrumental is mentioned but not universally recognized as a productive case.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the Udihe language exhibits a robust and diverse case system. The most relevant information is found in Paragraph 1, which explicitly states that the Udihe case system includes ten cases. This paragraph details the case suffixes for non-possessive forms and mentions that the Nominative case is zero-marked. The list of cases includes:

1. Nominative (zero-marked)
2. Accusative
3. Dative
4. Lative
5. Locative
6. Prolative
7. Ablative
8. Instrumental
9. Destinative

Additionally, Paragraph 1 mentions that the case inflection is fairly regular for all nouns, with some differences between class I and class II declensions. This indicates a productive and systematic case-marking paradigm.

Other paragraphs provide further details on the functions and uses of these cases, reinforcing the notion that Udihe has a well-developed case system. For instance, Paragraph 2 discusses the functions of the Accusative case, and Paragraph 4 elaborates on the Nominative case. Paragraph 7 also confirms the presence of the Accusative case and its morphological marking.

Given this information, it is clear that Udihe has a productive case system with ten distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Udmurt,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udmurt, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** lists several case suffixes for Udmurt nouns, including:
   - Nominative: 0
   - Accusative: 0, -ez
   - Genitive: -len
   - Ablative: -les
   - Dative: -li
   - Caritive: -tek
   - Adverbial: -ja
   - Instrumental: -en, -iz, -ti
   - Approximative: -lan
   - Inessive: -in
   - Illative: -i
   - Elative: -is
   - Egressive: -isen
   - Transitive: -eti
   - Terminative: -oz

2. **Paragraph 2** confirms the presence of local cases and mentions that Udmurt has 15 cases, including 7 local cases.

3. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that Udmurt possesses a great number of cases, specifically mentioning 15 cases, including many local cases.

4. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** provide further details on the distribution and use of these cases, confirming the presence of the cases listed in Paragraph 1.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Udmurt has a rich case system with at least 15 productive cases. These cases include both grammatical and local cases, covering a wide range of syntactic and semantic functions.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Urdu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urdu, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that nouns may occur in the nominative, oblique, or vocative case.
2. **Paragraph 2** explains that nouns followed by postpositions occur in the oblique case. It also notes that some grammarians treat postpositions as case markers, but this grammar considers only bound nominal suffixes (nominative, oblique, and vocative) as cases.
3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 4** discuss pronouns occurring in the nominative and oblique cases, with specific rules for first, second, and third person pronouns.
4. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 12** further elaborate on the use of nominative and oblique cases in different syntactic contexts, particularly with verbs and postpositions.
5. **Paragraph 11** provides a table showing the vocative case of nouns.
6. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the oblique case of pronouns and their forms.

From these observations, it is clear that Urdu has three productive cases for nouns: nominative, oblique, and vocative. The oblique case is used in conjunction with various postpositions to express different grammatical relations, but these postpositions themselves are not considered separate cases within the nominal inflectional paradigm.

**Reasoning:**
- The nominative case is used for subjects and sometimes direct objects.
- The oblique case is used when nouns are followed by postpositions, including the ergative postposition.
- The vocative case is used for direct address.

Given this information, Urdu has a small case paradigm consisting of three cases.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

   - Used to indicate location.
   - Examples: ""lebie-ge"" (earth-LOC), ""tabun-ge"" (that-LOC).

6. **Ablative Case**:
   - Used to indicate the source or origin.
   - Examples: ""iril-get"" (belly-ABL), ""tabun-get"" (that-ABL).

7. **Prolative Case**:
   - Used to indicate the path or route.
   - Examples: ""kis'il-gen"" (edge-PROL), ""tabun-get+ere"" (which.place-ABL+INDF).

8. **Comitative Case**:
   - Used to indicate accompaniment.
   - Examples: ""n'an'ulben-n'e"" (devil-COM), ""irk-in"" (one-ATTR).

9. **Predicative Case**:
   - Used for marking the nominal predicate or the focus of a clause.
   - Examples: ""soromo-lek"" (person-PRED), ""locil-ek"" (fire-PRED).

The paragraphs indicate that Yukaghir (Kolyma) has a robust system of case marking that includes at least the following cases: Nominative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ablative, Prolative, Comitative, and Predicative. This totals to nine distinct cases.

Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information about the case-marking system in Awa Pit:

1. **Accusative Case**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions the use of the Accusative postposition ""ta"" for marking objects and second objects.
   - Paragraph 3 details special Accusative suffixes for singular personal pronouns and Accusative clitics for plural personal pronouns.
   - Paragraph 5 confirms the use of ""ta"" as the Accusative marker for referential human noun phrases acting as objects or second objects.

2. **Possessive Marker**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 7 discuss the possessive marker ""pa"" used with nouns and the special possessive adjectives for personal pronouns.

3. **Nominative Case**:
   - Paragraph 20 explains that Awa Pit is a nominative-accusative language, with NPs in A (Agent) and S (Subject) functions being marked in the same way, distinctly from O (Object).

4. **Locative and Other Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 discuss various postpositions used in Awa Pit, including locative and instrumental markers, which are used to mark semantic roles rather than grammatical relations.

### Analysis:

- **Nominative Case**: The default case for subjects (A and S functions).
- **Accusative Case**: Marked by the postposition ""ta"" for objects (O function).
- **Possessive Marker**: ""pa"" used for possession, but not considered a core grammatical case.
- **Locative and Other Postpositions**: Used for marking peripheral roles and not considered core grammatical cases.

From the information provided, Awa Pit has a clear nominative-accusative case system with at least two productive cases:
- **Nominative**: For subjects (A and S functions).
- **Accusative**: For objects (O function).

The possessive marker ""pa"" and other postpositions (like locative) are not considered core grammatical cases but rather peripheral markers.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",10 or more cases,2 cases
Barasano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barasano, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **-re**: Marks the object, experiencer, benefactee, and manner.
2. **-réka**: Marks accompaniment and instrument.
3. **-h#**: Marks locations or times.
4. **-ya**: Marks the genitive.

These case markers are used to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles, but they are not obligatory. The presence of these four distinct morphemes that mark different grammatical relations suggests that Barasano has a productive case system with four cases.

### Reasoning:
- **-re**: This morpheme is used for multiple roles including object, experiencer, benefactee, and manner, indicating a broad functional range.
- **-réka**: Specifically marks accompaniment and instrument, showing a distinct case function.
- **-h#**: Used for marking locations or times, indicating a locative function.
- **-ya**: Marks genitive, indicating possession.

Given these four distinct and productive case markers, Barasano fits into the category of having four cases.

### Conclusion:

Epena Pedee,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Epena Pedee, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Ergative Case**: The ergative case is marked by the suffix -a for singular pronouns and -pa for plural pronouns. This case marks the subject of transitive clauses (Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13).

2. **Absolutive Case**: The absolutive case is not marked overtly. It is the default case for the subject of intransitive clauses and the object of transitive clauses (Paragraphs 3, 5, 7, 13).

3. **Dative Case**: The dative case is marked by -md-a, -a, or by vowel lengthening and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase. It indicates the recipient or goal in bitransitive clauses, goals of verbs of motion, and other inherent goals (Paragraphs 3, 4, 20).

4. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is marked by the clitic -pa, which is also used to mark the verb of a subordinate clause relating reason (Paragraph 3).

5. **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by -ma or -md-a, indicating location or direction (Paragraphs 3, 20).

6. **Benefactive/External Goal**: The benefactive or external goal is marked by the clitic -it’ée, which indicates the participant for whom the action is performed or the ultimate purpose of the action (Paragraph 20).

Given these observations, Epena Pedee has a productive case system with at least the following cases: ergative, absolutive, dative, instrumental, locative, and benefactive/external goal. This totals to six distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The ergative, absolutive, and dative cases are clearly defined and productive.
- The instrumental and locative cases are also productive and distinct.
- The benefactive/external goal case is marked and productive.

Therefore, the number of cases in Epena Pedee falls into the category of ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Hixkaryana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hixkaryana, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb prefixes to indicate the person of both the subject and the direct object, as well as postpositional phrases to express various syntactic and semantic relationships. Here are the key points that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Verb Prefixes for Person Marking**: The language uses a distinct set of prefixes in verbs to mark the person of both the subject and the direct object (Paragraph 2). This suggests that the language relies on verb morphology rather than noun morphology to indicate grammatical relations.

2. **Postpositional Phrases**: The language frequently uses postpositional phrases to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages (Paragraph 5). For example, indirect objects are marked by the relator ""wya"" meaning ""to, by"" (Paragraph 5).

3. **Absence of Case Marking on Nouns**: There is no mention of case suffixes or inflectional case marking on nouns in the provided paragraphs. Instead, relationships are expressed through verb prefixes and postpositions.

4. **Nominalization and Derived Forms**: The language has a rich system of nominalization and derived forms that function as nouns or adverbials, but these do not constitute a case system (Paragraphs 9 and 16).

5. **Equative Sentences and Copular Constructions**: Equative sentences and copular constructions use postpositional phrases rather than case marking to indicate relationships (Paragraph 18).

Given these points, Hixkaryana does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses verb prefixes and postpositional phrases to express grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Paumarí,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Ergative Case**: The language uses the enclitic -a to mark the subject of a transitive verb (ergative case). This is evident from multiple examples where the subject of a transitive verb is marked with -a (e.g., ""mamai-a"" for ""mother-ERG"" in paragraph 8).

2. **Objective Case**: The enclitic -ra is used to mark the object of a verb (objective case). This is shown in several examples where the object is marked with -ra (e.g., ""i'oa-ra"" for ""tambaqui-OBJ"" in paragraph 12).

3. **Demoted Object Case**: There is also mention of a ""demoted object"" marked by the enclitic -a in ditransitive clauses (e.g., ""ihai-a"" for ""medicine-DEMOT:O"" in paragraph 11).

4. **Oblique Case**: The enclitic -a is also used in passive constructions to mark an agentive phrase, indicating an oblique function (e.g., ""mina'di-a"" for ""eel-by"" in paragraph 14).

From this information, we can infer that Paumarí has a productive case system with at least four distinct cases: ergative, objective, demoted object, and oblique.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",3 cases,4 cases
Pirahã,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pirahã, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order. However, it also notes the presence of morphological markers for oblique relations, specifically the instrumental case marked by `-oal-ai` and the locative or general oblique case marked by `-o`. These markers are used to indicate oblique relations such as instruments and locations.

2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that oblique case is generally shown by the suffix `-o`, which is used for temporal expressions, conditionals, indirect objects, and certain particles.

3. **Paragraph 17** provides an example of the locative suffix `-o` being used within a postpositional phrase, indicating that this suffix is used productively to mark locative relations.

From these observations, it is clear that Pirahã has morphological markers for specific oblique relations, such as instrumental and locative cases. However, there is no evidence of a broader, more extensive case system that includes nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive cases. The primary method for indicating grammatical relations is word order, with morphological marking limited to certain oblique cases.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Pirahã's case-marking system is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**

This classification reflects the presence of morphological markers for specific oblique relations without a comprehensive case system that includes core grammatical relations.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Quechua (Imbabura),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imbabura Quechua, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system.

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that the syntactic role of pronouns is expressed in the same way as other nouns, with specific markers for nominative and accusative cases.
2. **Paragraph 9** discusses the use of postpositions to express various syntactic and semantic relationships, such as locative, dative, and instrumental cases.
3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of indicative noun clauses, showing the use of nominalizers and case markers like accusative and nominative.
4. **Paragraph 11** describes subjunctive noun clauses and the use of suffixes like -ngapaj and -chun, indicating subjunctive mood and case marking.
5. **Paragraph 13** discusses the use of postpositions and complex postpositions, indicating a rich system of locative and directional markers.
6. **Paragraph 15** provides examples of nouns marked with accusative and other postpositions, showing a productive case-marking system.
7. **Paragraph 16** describes the use of various suffixes, including those for locative, ablative, and other cases, indicating a robust system of morphological case-marking.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Imbabura Quechua:
- **Nominative** (unmarked for subjects)
- **Accusative** (-ta for direct objects)
- **Dative** (-man for indirect objects)
- **Locative** (-pi for location)
- **Ablative** (-manda for source)
- **Allative** (-man for direction)
- **Instrumental** (-wan for means)
- **Benefactive** (-paj for benefactive)

These cases indicate a productive system of morphological case-marking for various syntactic and semantic roles.

### Conclusion:
**6-7 cases**",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Sanuma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sanuma, the following observations can be made regarding the case-marking system:

1. **Ergative Marker**: The marker -nd is used to mark the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses, functioning as an ergative marker. This indicates that Sanuma has a morphological distinction for subjects of transitive verbs (ergative) versus subjects of intransitive verbs and direct objects (absolutive).

2. **Peripheral Cases**: The marker niha/nihamé/ha/ham6 is used for marking peripheral roles such as noninstigational agent, instrument, and goal. These markers are used in specific syntactic constructions, including existence clauses and comparison phrases.

3. **Comitative and Subordinate Markers**: The marker kai is used for marking subordinate participants in a comitative construction, indicating a leader-follower relationship.

4. **Locational Adverbs and Postpositions**: Locational adverbs and postpositions like hise and ha/hamo are used to indicate location, which suggests the presence of locative marking.

From these observations, it is clear that Sanuma has a system of case-marking that includes an ergative marker, peripheral markers for roles such as instrument and goal, and locative markers. However, the primary syntactic relations (subject, object) are marked by the ergative-absolutive distinction, and additional roles are marked by specific markers.

Given the presence of these markers, Sanuma does not fit into the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" or ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" Instead, it has a productive case system with at least the following cases:

- Ergative (marked by -nd)
- Absolutive (unmarked)
- Instrumental/Goal (marked by niha/nihamé/ha/ham6)
- Locative (marked by hise/ha/hamo)

This suggests that Sanuma has a case system with at least four distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Shipibo-Konibo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Shipibo-Konibo, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 7** both indicate that Shipibo-Konibo has an ergative-absolutive case-marking system. The ergative case is marked overtly, while the absolutive case is marked by zero. The ergative morpheme {-n} has various allomorphs and is used to mark ergative, genitive, instrumental, and locative/directional functions. This suggests that there are multiple cases beyond just ergative and absolutive.

2. **Paragraph 7** further elaborates that the ergative morpheme is used for multiple functions, including genitive, instrumental, and locative/directional. This indicates that Shipibo-Konibo has at least these four cases: ergative, absolutive, genitive, and instrumental.

3. **Paragraph 19** discusses the desiderative construction, which involves a change in case-marking from ergative to absolutive, indicating a lower transitivity. This suggests that the language has a nuanced system of case-marking that can reflect different syntactic and semantic roles.

4. **Paragraph 20** mentions various suffixes used in verb inflection, including those for transitivity alternation and applicatives, which further supports the presence of multiple cases.

From the information provided, it is clear that Shipibo-Konibo has a productive case system with at least the following cases:
- Ergative
- Absolutive
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Locative/Directional

Given the presence of these cases and the complexity of the case-marking system, Shipibo-Konibo falls into the category of having 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several case markers: Ergative (-ek/-k), Dative (-etl/-tl, -ki, -es/-s), Allative ((h)i’ta), Ablative (lots’), Instrumental (/etsi), Comitative (tam), and Locative (-n/-en).
2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates the case markers and adds the Genitive (-kate/-kte).
3. **Paragraph 7** states that Trumai has an Ergative-Absolutive alignment and identifies three core argument types: Absolutive, Ergative, and Dative.
4. **Paragraph 11** distinguishes between case markers and postpositions, indicating that case markers are phonologically bound forms.
5. **Paragraph 14** categorizes verbs based on case-marking patterns, further supporting the presence of multiple cases.
6. **Paragraph 20** discusses the use of pluralizers and case markers, reinforcing the presence of distinct case markers for different grammatical roles.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive case markers in Trumai:
- **Ergative**: -ek/-k
- **Dative**: -etl/-tl, -ki, -es/-s
- **Allative**: (h)i’ta
- **Ablative**: lots’
- **Instrumental**: /etsi
- **Comitative**: tam
- **Locative**: -n/-en
- **Genitive**: -kate/-kte

This gives us a total of 8 distinct cases: Ergative, Dative, Allative, Ablative, Instrumental, Comitative, Locative, and Genitive.

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",5 cases,8-9 cases
Urubú-Kaapor,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urubú-Kaapor, we can analyze the presence and function of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 7** mentions that the only element that might be considered a case marker is the suffix ""ke,"" which marks the object in a transitive clause when two nominals occur. This suggests that ""ke"" functions as an object marker.

2. **Paragraph 16** elaborates on the use of ""ke,"" stating that it can occur with the subject nominal in both intransitive and transitive clauses, as well as in postpositional phrases. However, its primary function appears to be object marking, with other uses being more about highlighting or focus.

3. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of genitive phrases, indicating possession through possessive pronouns and nominal phrases. This suggests a genitive construction but does not indicate a separate genitive case marker.

4. **Paragraph 8** further discusses genitive constructions and possessive pronouns, reinforcing the idea that possession is expressed through pronouns rather than a distinct genitive case marker.

From the information provided, it appears that Urubú-Kaapor has a single productive case marker, ""ke,"" which primarily functions as an object marker. There is no evidence of a broader case system with multiple distinct cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. The genitive construction is handled through possessive pronouns rather than a separate genitive case marker.

Given this analysis, Urubú-Kaapor fits the category of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it has a single marker for a specific syntactic function (object marking) and does not exhibit a full-fledged case system.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Warao,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Dative (DAT)**: Indicated by suffixes such as -ta, -isi, and -ma, which are used to mark beneficiaries or indirect objects.
2. **Locative (LOC)**: Indicated by suffixes such as -te and -tika, which are used to denote location.
3. **Allative (ALL)**: Indicated by the suffix -ya, which is used to denote direction towards something.
4. **Ablative (ABL)**: Indicated by the suffix -mo, which is used to denote source or origin.

The case markers in Warao are primarily used for peripheral or semantic relations, such as locatives and instrumentals, rather than for core syntactic functions like subject or direct object marking. This suggests that Warao has overt marking only for these concrete or peripheral case relations.

### Reasoning:
- **Paragraph 1** mentions the presence of case markers such as DAT, LOC, ALL, and ABL, which are used for indirect objects and adjuncts, conveying temporal and spatial meanings.
- **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** further illustrate the use of these case markers in various contexts, confirming their roles in marking peripheral relations.
- **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 16** reinforce the idea that these markers are used for specific functions like beneficiaries and locations, rather than for core syntactic roles.

Given this information, Warao fits the category of languages with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it has overt marking only for peripheral or semantic case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological means by which syntactic and semantic functions of noun phrases are expressed.

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that aside from possessive suffixes and a prefix for kinship terms, there are no other ways to directly mark noun functions on the noun. It also states that there are no internal morphophonemic alterations to express syntactic and semantic functions in the noun phrase. This indicates a lack of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 6**: Explicitly states that there is no case marking in the language. This is a clear indication that Wari' does not use morphological case-marking to indicate grammatical relations.

3. **Paragraph 17**: Reiterates that there is no case marking in the language, confirming the information provided in Paragraph 6.

4. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the expression of nonlocal semantic functions such as benefactive, source, and instrumental, which are expressed through prepositional phrases or verb compounds rather than morphological case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 12**: States that there is no case marking and that the preposition does not govern case, further supporting the absence of morphological case-marking.

6. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions the use of possessive suffixes and demonstrative pronouns for anaphora, but does not indicate any case-marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, Wari' does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The language relies on other means such as prepositions and verb compounds to express syntactic and semantic relations.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of Set I and Set II clitics to mark arguments (A and S roles), but it does not indicate the presence of morphological case marking on nouns themselves. Instead, it suggests a reliance on clitics and word order.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses free pronouns and their roles but does not mention morphological case marking on nouns.
3. **Paragraph 3** describes the use of clitics in different discourse contexts but again does not indicate morphological case marking on nouns.
4. **Paragraph 4** talks about noun phrase structure and modifiers but does not mention morphological case marking.
5. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of clitics in different syntactic positions, but there is no mention of morphological case marking on nouns.
6. **Paragraph 6** describes causative constructions and the use of clitics, without indicating morphological case marking on nouns.
7. **Paragraph 7** mentions predicate nominal clauses and the use of clitics, but not morphological case marking.
8. **Paragraph 8** discusses valence-decreasing constructions and does not mention morphological case marking.
9. **Paragraph 9** describes interrogative forms and their roles but does not mention morphological case marking.
10. **Paragraph 10** talks about nominalized verbs and their adverbial functions, without mentioning morphological case marking.
11. **Paragraph 11** describes the use of syntactically nominal forms as adverbs but does not mention morphological case marking.
12. **Paragraph 12** discusses two-object clauses and the use of clitics, without mentioning morphological case marking.
13. **Paragraph 13** describes postpositional phrases and the use of postpositions, which might be mistaken for case markers but are not morphological case markers on nouns.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses the use of clitics for possessors and subjects but does not mention morphological case marking.
15. **Paragraph 15** mentions the rare use of free pronouns for possessors and oblique participants but does not indicate morphological case marking.
16. **Paragraph 16** describes word order and the use of clitics but does not mention morphological case marking.
17. **Paragraph 17** discusses the pronoun system and the use of clitics but does not indicate morphological case marking.
18. **Paragraph 18** describes participant reference and the use of clitics but does not mention morphological case marking.
19. **Paragraph 19** discusses the animate/inanimate distinction in the pronominal system but does not mention morphological case marking.
20. **Paragraph 20** mentions the avoidance of full noun phrases and the use of clitics but does not indicate morphological case marking.

From the analysis, it is clear that Yagua relies heavily on clitics (Set I and Set II) and word order to mark grammatical relations, rather than morphological case marking on nouns. There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in the provided text.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Core Case Marking**: Hup has a nominative-accusative alignment system. Subjects are unmarked, while objects are marked with the suffix -a‡n, depending on the animacy and definiteness of the noun. This indicates the presence of at least two core cases: nominative (unmarked) and accusative (marked with -a‡n).

2. **Oblique Case Marking**: Hup also employs an oblique case marker -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles. Additionally, there is a directional marker -an used in locative and allative/ablative roles. These markers are used for various non-core arguments, indicating that Hup has a productive system for marking oblique cases.

3. **Differential Object Marking**: The object marking in Hup is sensitive to animacy and definiteness, which is a common feature in languages with differential object marking systems.

4. **Summary of Cases**: Based on the information, Hup has:
   - Nominative (unmarked for subjects)
   - Accusative (marked with -a‡n for objects)
   - Oblique (marked with -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles)
   - Directional (marked with -an for locative and allative/ablative roles)

Given this information, Hup has a system that includes at least four distinct cases: nominative, accusative, oblique, and directional.

**Reasoning**: The presence of distinct markers for nominative, accusative, oblique, and directional roles indicates that Hup has a productive case system with at least four cases.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), the language exhibits the following case-marking features:

1. **Core Cases**: 
   - Nominative-Accusative system for core arguments (S/A and O).
   - Differential case marking for core arguments based on discourse status (e.g., topicality and specificity).
   - Core arguments can also be marked for the locative/dative case, which can be omitted with pronouns.

2. **Oblique Cases**:
   - Five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.
   - Oblique cases do not co-occur with core cases in a single NP, except potentially the ablative.

3. **Genitive**:
   - There is a genitive form, but it is not strictly considered a case as it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations.

4. **Case Markers**:
   - All case markers are suffixes, and each NP takes a single case marker at a time.
   - The topical S/A marker is an enclitic.

From this information, it is clear that Huitoto (Murui) has a productive case system with distinct markers for core and oblique cases. The core cases include nominative, accusative, and locative/dative, while the oblique cases include locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative. This gives us a total of at least 8 distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has a nominative-accusative system with differential marking for core arguments.
- There are five additional oblique cases.
- The genitive is not counted as a case since it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations.

**Conclusion**: 8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no direct evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns in Iquito. The paragraphs primarily discuss aspects of word order, verb inflection, and the behavior of pronouns and determiners in various syntactic environments. There is no mention of morphological case markers that would indicate a system of cases for nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1:** Discusses tense and aspect inflection on verbs, with no mention of case marking on nouns.
   - **Paragraph 2:** Mentions word order changes with indefinite subjects but does not discuss case marking.
   - **Paragraph 3:** Describes elements that can appear in certain syntactic positions, focusing on word order rather than case marking.
   - **Paragraph 4:** Shows word order patterns with nominal subjects and objects but does not indicate case marking.
   - **Paragraph 5:** Discusses tense and aspect morphology in conditionals, with no reference to case marking.
   - **Paragraph 6:** Mentions grammatical tense and aspects but not case marking.
   - **Paragraph 7:** Describes disjunction and conjunction in sentences, focusing on pronouns and word order.
   - **Paragraph 8:** Discusses the position of negative particles and pronouns in irrealis mood, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 9:** Provides a detailed study of word order variations, without reference to case marking.
   - **Paragraph 10:** Mentions the use of independent pronouns for emphasis but does not discuss case marking.
   - **Paragraph 11:** Discusses derivational verbal morphemes related to event quantification, not case marking.
   - **Paragraph 12:** Discusses situation types and aspectual distinctions, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 13:** Analyzes control structures and raising, without reference to case marking.
   - **Paragraph 14:** Describes word order in complex verbal predicates, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 15:** Provides examples of distributive events, focusing on verbal morphology rather than case marking.
   - **Paragraph 16:** Discusses the position of pronominal objects in irrealis clauses, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 17:** Concludes that basic word order is SVO, with no reference to case marking.
   - **Paragraph 18:** Discusses the position of coordinators in disjunction, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 19:** Describes cliticization of determiners in irrealis clauses, with no mention of case marking.
   - **Paragraph 20:** Discusses future context and irrealis clauses, focusing on verbal morphology rather than case marking.

Given the absence of any explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns, it is reasonable to conclude that Iquito does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, Movima exhibits a distinction between structural and oblique cases. The structural case is unmarked and identifies core arguments, while the oblique case is marked by the prefix ""n-"" on the referential element. This distinction is clearly outlined in Paragraph 2, where examples illustrate the difference between unmarked (structural) and oblique-marked NPs.

The presence of only these two cases—structural (unmarked) and oblique (marked by ""n-"")—indicates that Movima has a minimal case system. There is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms for nouns beyond these two categories. The oblique case covers a range of functions, including goals, sources, temporal adjuncts, purposes, locations, and instruments, but these are all subsumed under the single oblique case marker ""n-"".

### Conclusion:
2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Apinayé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions person prefixes used for nouns, verbs, and postpositions, including an accusative prefix (ku-). However, this prefix is used in a limited context and does not indicate a comprehensive case system.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the morphosyntactic classes of verbs and mentions ergative marking in subordinate clauses, suggesting some form of case marking in specific syntactic environments.
3. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of ergative and accusative markers, indicating the presence of at least two cases: ergative and accusative.
4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of postpositions for marking arguments, including dative, instrumental, locative, and inessive postpositions, which are used to mark oblique arguments.
5. **Paragraph 5** mentions demonstrative pronouns and their functions but does not provide additional information on case-marking.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses word order and the use of person prefixes, reinforcing the presence of ergative and accusative markers.
7. **Paragraph 7** provides examples of verb forms and their arguments, including the use of postpositions for marking oblique arguments.
8. **Paragraph 8** discusses determiners and their hierarchical structure within noun phrases, without additional case-marking information.
9. **Paragraph 9** mentions reflexivization and the use of postpositions, including the dative postposition.
10. **Paragraph 10** discusses imperatives and reflexivization, with examples of noncanonical predicates.
11. **Paragraph 11** describes noun-noun compounds and the use of relational prefixes, without additional case-marking information.
12. **Paragraph 12** discusses noun modification and the use of nonfinite verb forms within noun phrases.
13. **Paragraph 13** describes the structure of subordinate clauses and the use of postpositions for marking arguments.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses imperatives and the use of person inflection, without additional case-marking information.
15. **Paragraph 15** describes genitive constructions and the use of relational prefixes and postpositions.
16. **Paragraph 16** discusses noun modification and the use of alienable and inalienable nouns.
17. **Paragraph 17** mentions the dative postposition and its various functions.
18. **Paragraph 18** describes the structure of postpositional phrases and the use of relational prefixes.
19. **Paragraph 19** discusses the use of independent pronouns and their distribution in clauses.
20. **Paragraph 20** describes noun modification and the use of nominalizers.

From the information provided, it is clear that Apinayé employs a combination of ergative, accusative, and various postpositional markers (dative, instrumental, locative, inessive) to indicate grammatical relations. However, the use of these markers is not extensive enough to constitute a large case system. Instead, the language relies on a limited set of case markers and postpositions to mark specific syntactic and semantic roles.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of ergative and accusative markers suggests a basic case system.
- The use of postpositions for marking oblique arguments (dative, instrumental, locative, inessive) indicates additional case-like functions.
- The overall system appears to be limited and does not exhibit a large number of productive case paradigms.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Cacua,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Case Markers and Functions**:
   - **Core Cases**:
     - **Subject**: Cross-referenced by proclitics on the verb.
     - **Object**: Marked by the case marker =diʔ.
   - **Other Cases (Adjuncts)**:
     - **Locative**: =bǔ
     - **Instrumental/Comitative**: =hiʔ̃́
     - **Terminative**: pɨ (preposition)

2. **Object Marking**:
   - Object arguments (direct and indirect) are marked with the case marker =diʔ.
   - Differential Object Marking (DOM) is influenced by animacy, definiteness, and other discourse-related characteristics.

3. **Adjunct Marking**:
   - Adjuncts can be marked with locative, instrumental/comitative, and terminative markers.

Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Yuracare as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses verbs, nouns, and adjectives, but does not provide explicit information on case-marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions demonstrative pronouns and their use with postpositional marking, but does not indicate a productive case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Talks about direct object marking on inherently transitive verbs and noun types, indicating some form of object marking but not a full-fledged case system.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses noun phrases and the use of adjectives, but does not provide information on case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Describes the use of locative markers and other derivational suffixes, but these are not indicative of a productive case system.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the use of collective and distributive markers on nouns, but these are not case markers.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions inherently singular and plural nouns, but does not discuss case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Talks about verbal agreement, voice, and valency, indicating that grammatical relations are marked through verbal cross-referencing rather than a case system.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses clitics and their classification, but these are not case markers.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Describes Yuracare morphology as agglutinating with some fusion, but does not mention a case system.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Lists postpositional clitics used for marking peripheral participants (comitative, instrument, locative, direction, ablative), indicating that these functions are marked by postpositions rather than a productive case system.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses parts of speech, but does not provide information on case-marking.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions adjectives and their position relative to nouns, but does not discuss case-marking.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Talks about transitive verbs and the position of subjects and objects, but does not provide information on case-marking.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Describes verbs beginning with /i/ and their object marking, but this is not indicative of a case system.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the order of prefixes and suffixes, but does not mention case-marking.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Mentions the use of locative, directional, and ablative markers, but these are postpositions rather than a productive case system.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses possession marking on nouns, but this is not related to case-marking.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Describes the structure of noun phrases and the use of postpositional enclitics for marking peripheral relations, indicating that these functions are marked by postpositions rather than a productive case system.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Reiterates that Yuracare is a pro-drop language with head-marking characteristics, but does not mention a case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Yuracare does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it uses postpositional clitics to mark peripheral relations such as comitative, instrument, locative, direction, and ablative. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Yuracare is:

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking on nouns. Here is a summary of the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Genitive Case**:
   - The genitive case is marked by the suffix -be and is used to show possession. It is productive and can be used with both animate and inanimate nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, and loan words (Paragraphs 1, 6).

2. **Benefactive Case**:
   - The benefactive case is marked by -am for inanimate nouns and -byam for animate nouns (Paragraphs 1, 5).

3. **Instrumental Case**:
   - The instrumental case is marked by -ak, with allomorphs -k and -ek depending on the phonological context (Paragraph 5).

4. **Comitative Case**:
   - The comitative case is marked by -abtak and is used for accompaniment, applying only to animate nouns (Paragraph 5).

5. **Locative Case**:
   - The locative case is marked by -ok for inanimate nouns and -biok for animate nouns (Paragraph 5).

6. **Ablative Case**:
   - The ablative case is marked by -okan for inanimate nouns and -biokan for animate nouns (Paragraph 7).

7. **Adessive Case**:
   - The adessive case is marked by -ents̈ and is used for location at a place (Paragraph 7).

8. **Illative Case**:
   - The illative case is marked by -iñ and is used for motion into something (Paragraph 7).

9. **Allative Case**:
   - The allative case is marked by -oy for inanimate nouns and -bioy for animate nouns (Paragraph 7).

### Conclusion:
Camsá has a total of nine distinct morphological cases: Genitive, Benefactive, Instrumental, Comitative, Locative, Ablative, Adessive, Illative, and Allative. This places Camsá in the category of languages with ""10 or more cases"" since the number of cases is very close to this threshold and the language exhibits a rich case system.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made about the case system in Kadiwéu:

1. **Paragraph 1** indicates that Kadiwéu has nominative and accusative cases for pronominals, with subjects in the nominative case and objects marked by a different set of pronominals.
2. **Paragraph 3** introduces several morphemes such as -d: 'theme', -gi 'goal', -wa ~ -ma 'dative', -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma 'benefactive', -k 'allative', and -lokom 'adessive' as semantic case suffixes marking arguments.
3. **Paragraph 4** clarifies that the morpheme -d: indicates the semantic role of a pronominal (theme) rather than its case, suggesting that these markers are more about semantic roles than traditional grammatical cases.
4. **Paragraph 5** mentions the use of the semantic case marker -d: 'theme' in specific syntactic contexts.
5. **Paragraph 8** states that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic case morphology.
6. **Paragraph 9** provides examples of pronominal affixes or clitics co-occurring with different semantic case markers.
7. **Paragraph 14** reiterates that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements assigning semantic roles and that nouns do not co-occur with such semantic role assigners.
8. **Paragraph 15** mentions that valency suffixes license semantic arguments and that transitivizing morphemes like -d: 'theme', -gi 'goal', -wa ~ -ma 'dative', -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma 'benefactive', -k 'allative', and -lokom 'adessive' license grammatical arguments.

From these observations, it is clear that Kadiwéu uses a set of morphemes to mark semantic roles rather than traditional grammatical cases. These semantic role markers are used with pronominals and not with nouns, suggesting that the language does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on these markers to indicate specific semantic roles, which aligns with the definition of ""exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Karajá,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions relative and absolutive cases but does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2** lists various postpositions (e.g., locative, ablative, instrumental, dative, allative, comitative, comparative), which are used to mark relationships typically expressed by cases in other languages. However, these are postpositions, not morphological case markers.
3. **Paragraph 6** discusses the antipassive construction, which involves marking the verb rather than the noun, indicating that the language uses verbal morphology to handle some syntactic roles.
4. **Paragraph 9** explicitly states that core NP arguments (subject and direct object) are not morphologically marked, which strongly suggests the absence of a productive case system.
5. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 20** further illustrate the use of postpositions for marking oblique relationships, reinforcing the idea that Karajá relies on postpositions rather than morphological case markers.

Given the reliance on postpositions for marking relationships typically handled by cases in other languages and the explicit statement that core arguments are not morphologically marked, it is clear that Karajá does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Baure, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that Baure nouns involve categories like inherent gender, number, possession, inherent class, and a peripheral case (locative).
   - It explicitly states that there are no core cases in Baure, as semantic roles are generally marked on the verb (head-marking).
   - The locative marking on nouns referring to locations could be considered an oblique case, but there are no core cases.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Reiterates that Baure is a head-marking language with no core cases. Only locative nouns are marked by a locative suffix, which is a possible instance of dependent-marking.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Discusses the structure of noun phrases and mentions locative noun roots but does not introduce any new case markers beyond the locative.

4. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Mentions possessive constructions and the use of possessive pronouns but does not introduce additional case markers.

5. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses the derivation of abstract nouns and adjectives but does not introduce new case markers.

6. **Paragraph 8**:
   - Mentions the use of possessive pronouns and the marking of possessors but does not introduce additional case markers.

7. **Paragraph 9**:
   - Discusses the use of locative morphemes and the incorporation of locative roots into verbs but does not introduce new case markers.

8. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Discusses noun classification and classifiers but does not introduce additional case markers.

9. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Mentions the structure of noun bases and the use of locative suffixes but does not introduce new case markers.

10. **Paragraph 12**:
    - Discusses locative constructions and the use of locative noun stems but does not introduce new case markers.

11. **Paragraph 13**:
    - Discusses the use of personal clitics and enclitics but does not introduce new case markers.

12. **Paragraph 14**:
    - Discusses the use of personal pronouns and possessive pronouns but does not introduce new case markers.

13. **Paragraph 15**:
    - Discusses the structure of simple clauses and the order of core arguments but does not introduce new case markers.

14. **Paragraph 16**:
    - Discusses the use of personal clitics and enclitics but does not introduce new case markers.

15. **Paragraph 17**:
    - Discusses the structure of simple clauses and the order of core arguments but does not introduce new case markers.

16. **Paragraph 18**:
    - Discusses the use of demonstrative pronouns and determiners but does not introduce new case markers.

17. **Paragraph 19**:
    - Discusses the use of personal clitics and enclitics but does not introduce new case markers.

18. **Paragraph 20**:
    - Discusses the use of articles and demonstrative pronouns but does not introduce new case markers.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Baure has no core cases and only a peripheral locative case. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
