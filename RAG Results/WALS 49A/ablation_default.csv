Maranungku,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maranungku, we can identify several instances of case marking that provide insight into the number of productive cases in the language.

1. **Possessive Adjectives**:
   - The possessive adjectives in Maranungku are used to indicate possession and follow the noun in all cases. Examples include ""ngany"" (my), ""nina"" (your), and ""nankuny"" (his). These forms change depending on the possessor's number and inclusivity/exclusivity, indicating a genitive case.

2. **Pronoun Objects**:
   - The object pronouns are expressed with suffixes such as ""-ngany"" (me), ""-nimpe"" (you singular), ""-na"" (him), ""-nga"" (her), etc. These suffixes indicate an accusative case.

3. **Benefactive and Privative**:
   - The benefactive forms (e.g., ""ngeni-la"" for ""for me"", ""nimpe-le"" for ""for you singular"") and privative forms (e.g., ""ngenira"" for ""from me"", ""nimpere"" for ""from you singular"") indicate specific roles related to the beneficiary and source, respectively. These forms suggest the presence of dative and ablative cases.

4. **Locative and Directional Markers**:
   - Locative markers such as ""yena"" (on, in, at), ""penpe"" (under), and ""wanungu"" (on top of) indicate spatial relationships. Directional markers like ""nungu"" (towards), ""mere"" (away), ""yangana"" (from a place), and ""vena"" (to a place) further indicate movement and location. These markers suggest locative and allative cases.

5. **Instrumental**:
   - The instrumental marker ""nunu"" (with) is used to indicate the means by which an action is performed, suggesting an instrumental case.

6. **Purpose and Cause**:
   - The use of ""nala"" to indicate purpose (e.g., ""I am going for a swim"") and ""yangana"" to indicate cause (e.g., ""because of the bee"") suggests the presence of purposive and causal cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Maranungku exhibits a variety of productive case paradigms, including nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative, allative, instrumental, purposive, and causal cases. This indicates that Maranungku has a rich case system.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",exclusively borderline case-marking,10 or more cases
Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can determine the number of cases in the language.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi."" This indicates that Tiwi does not use morphological case-marking for its nouns and adjectives.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the use of prepositions and relator-axis phrases to indicate locative and directional meanings. The presence of prepositions like ""kayi"" and ""kapi"" suggests that spatial relationships are expressed through prepositions rather than case inflections on nouns.

Given this information, Tiwi does not employ productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ungarinjin, we can identify several productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is a summary of the cases mentioned:

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Wambaya,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided descriptive grammar of Wambaya, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used to mark intransitive subjects and vocatives. It is marked with a zero suffix.
2. **Accusative Case**: Used to mark transitive objects. It is also marked with a zero suffix.
3. **Ergative/Locative/Instrumental Case**: This case covers ergative, locative, and instrumental functions. It has multiple allomorphs (-ni, -nu, -ji, -yi) depending on phonological and morphological conditions.
4. **Dative Case**: Used for indirect objects, purpose, beneficiary, possession, and animate location. It has allomorphs -nka, -ja, and -janka.
5. **Allative Case**: Indicates direction towards an object or destination. It is marked by -nmanji.
6. **Ablative Case**: Indicates direction away from a location or object. It has allomorphs -ngani and -nnga.
7. **Perlative Case**: Expresses meanings like 'across, along, through'. It is marked by -nkanyi.
8. **Comitative Case**: Expresses accompaniment. It has allomorphs -yili (for free pronouns) and -mbili (for other nominals).
9. **Causal Case**: Marks a noun as the cause or reason for an event. It is marked by -nmarndi.
10. **Genitive Case**: Marks possession and agrees in gender with the possessed noun. It has various forms like -nîganji, -nîganya, -nîganka, and special forms for kinship nouns.
11. **Proprietive Case**: Indicates possession or a characteristic. It has gender-specific forms like -nguji, -ngunya, -ngunyma, -nguja.
12. **Privative Case**: Indicates the absence of something. It has multiple allomorphs depending on the final segment of the stem and gender.
13. **Origin Case**: Marks origin or usual habitat. It has forms like -inji, -înya, -inja.

Given the extensive list of productive case paradigms, Wambaya clearly has a rich case system.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amharic, we can identify the following case markers and their functions:

1. **Direct Object Marker**:
   - The marker `-n` is used to indicate the direct object when the noun is determined by an article, possessive pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, adjective, or being a proper noun. This is extensively discussed in Paragraph 2, where various examples illustrate the use of `-n` for direct objects.

2. **Indirect Object Marker**:
   - The indirect object is expressed by the prefix `lə-` attached to the noun or pronoun. This is mentioned in Paragraph 2, where examples show the use of `lə-` to indicate the indirect object.

3. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Possessive suffixes are used to indicate possession, but these are not considered separate cases as they do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns.

4. **Emphatic Marker**:
   - The element `-nu` is used for emphasis, which is a combination of the direct object marker `-n` and the article `-u`.

5. **Locative and Instrumental Constructions**:
   - There are mentions of locative and instrumental constructions using prepositions like `lay` (on, upon), but these are not integrated into a productive case system.

From the analysis, it is evident that Amharic primarily uses two productive case markers: one for the direct object (`-n`) and one for the indirect object (`lə-`). Other markers and constructions mentioned do not form additional productive cases but rather serve specific syntactic or emphatic functions.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Beja,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Beja, the following points are noted regarding case marking:

1. **Nominative and Accusative Cases**:
   - The text explicitly mentions that ""Two cases are distinguished in the noun-phrase: nominative and accusative"" (Paragraph 1, Section 3.4).
   - These cases are used to mark subjects and complements respectively.

2. **Genitive Constructions**:
   - The accusative case is also used as the basis for genitival constructions (Paragraph 1, Section 3.4).
   - Possessive noun-phrases involve a genitive suffix that shows concord with the possessed noun (Paragraph 1, Section 4.1).

3. **Vocatives**:
   - The nominative case is also used as the basis for vocatives (Paragraph 1, Section 3.4).

4. **No Additional Cases**:
   - There is no mention of other cases such as dative, locative, instrumental, etc., which would indicate a more extensive case system.

5. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The cases mentioned (nominative, accusative, and genitive) are part of the productive case paradigms of nouns, as they are used to mark grammatical relations within noun phrases and possessive constructions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Beja has a system that distinguishes between nominative and accusative cases, with the accusative also serving a genitive function. Therefore, the language has a total of **2 cases**.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Middle Atlas Berber, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system of the language.

### Analysis:

1. **State Alternation**:
   - The text describes a system where nouns vary in form according to their syntactic environment, referred to as ""state"" alternation. This includes the ""normal state"" and the ""construct state."" The construct state is used in specific syntactic contexts such as after prepositions, in noun complement constructions, and after certain numerals.
   - This alternation affects the first syllable of the noun and involves prefixing or dropping vowels depending on the noun's initial vowel and gender-number prefix.

2. **Construct State**:
   - The construct state appears to be a form of morphological marking that changes the noun's form based on its syntactic role, particularly in relation to prepositions and numerals.
   - Examples include:
     - /a-ryaz/ (normal state) -> /w-ryaz/ (construct state) for 'man'
     - /asif/ (normal state) -> /wasif/ (construct state) for 'river'

3. **Prepositions and Noun Complements**:
   - The grammar mentions that certain prepositions require the noun to be in the construct state, indicating a syntactic dependency that triggers a morphological change in the noun.

4. **Demonstratives and Pronouns**:
   - The text also discusses demonstrative suffixes and pronominal bases, but these do not seem to directly relate to case-marking of nouns.

### Conclusion:
The morphological changes described in the grammar, particularly the alternation between normal and construct states, suggest a system that marks nouns differently based on their syntactic roles. However, this system does not correspond to a traditional case system with multiple distinct cases like nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, it seems to be a more limited system of marking specific syntactic environments.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate classification for Middle Atlas Berber's case-marking system is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Diola-Fogny,,no morphological case-marking,
Gimira,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used for marking the subject of a sentence. There are specific suffixes for different pronouns and noun forms.
2. **Accusative Case**: Used for marking the direct object of a sentence.
3. **Genitive Case**: Used for indicating possession.
4. **Dative/Benefactive Case**: Used for indicating the indirect object or the beneficiary of an action.
5. **Locative Case**: Used for indicating location or direction.
6. **Ablative Case**: Used for indicating movement away from something.
7. **Instrumental Case**: Used for indicating the means by which an action is performed.

The grammar explicitly lists these cases and provides examples of their usage, confirming that Gimira has a productive case system with at least these seven cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Grebo, the focus is primarily on the pronoun system, including subject, object, possessive, and relative pronouns. There is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The pronouns are described in terms of their tonal variations and syntactic positions, but there is no indication of morphological case-marking for nouns.

Given this information, it appears that Grebo does not utilize a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical mechanisms, such as pronouns and tonal distinctions, to convey these relationships.

**Reasoning:**
- The paragraph details the use of pronouns in various syntactic roles (subject, object, possessive, relative) without mentioning any case inflections for nouns.
- The description focuses on tonal variations and syntactic positions rather than morphological case-marking.
- There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in the provided text.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Genitival Relationship**:
   - The genitival relationship in Igbo involves tonal changes rather than morphological changes to indicate possession. For example, ""0 zur dla ddha"" (He bought the eldest daughter’s land) and ""0 hard ulo jt"" (He saw the yam store) show that possession is indicated by the order and tonal behavior of the nouns rather than by affixes or inflections.

2. **Nouns in Subject and Object Relationship to the Verb**:
   - The subject and object relationships are primarily indicated by word order and tonal changes. For instance, ""Egh@ tara ji"" (The goat ate the yam) and ""Oké tard ji"" (The rat ate the yam) show that the subject retains its inherent tones, while objects may undergo tonal changes.

3. **Pronouns**:
   - Pronouns in Igbo have separable and inseparable forms, and their grammatical relations are expressed through tone and word order rather than morphological case marking. For example, ""O hari m"" (He saw me) and ""Azir% ma anu"" (I bought meat) illustrate the use of pronouns without additional case markers.

4. **Prepositions and Conjunctions**:
   - The use of prepositions and conjunctions in Igbo does not involve morphological case marking. For example, ""O wi na ya ka o ga iwiisa ya"" (It is on him that he will pour it) shows the use of prepositions without case inflections.

5. **General Principles**:
   - The overall system of marking grammatical relations in Igbo relies heavily on tonal changes and word order rather than on morphological case marking. This is consistent across different syntactic structures, including genitival, subject, and object relationships.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Igbo does not have productive morphological case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it uses tonal changes and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Construct Case**: This is used when a noun is modified by another noun, an adjective, a numeral, or a relative clause. It is marked by a high tone and a suffix that agrees in gender with the noun.
2. **Adverbial Case Clitics**: These include:
   - **Directive Case**: Marked by the suffix -i, indicating direction towards.
   - **Ablative Case**: Marked by the suffix -wa, indicating direction away from.
   - **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix -r or -ar, indicating the means by which an action is performed.
   - **Reason Case**: Marked by the suffix -sa, indicating the reason for an action.
3. **Background Case**: Marked by the suffix -o or -hee, used to establish a domain that is backgrounded, negated, or questioned.
4. **Vocative Case**: Indicated by a high tone on the penultimate syllable when addressing a person.

These cases are used productively in the language to mark various grammatical relations and functions of nouns. The presence of these distinct and productive case markers indicates that Iraqw has a well-developed case system.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraph, there is no explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns in Kinyarwanda. The examples given focus on verb forms, causative constructions, and sentence structures without indicating any specific case endings or inflections on the nouns themselves. The sentences provided do not show any overt case markers that would typically indicate nominative, accusative, genitive, or other cases.

Given the absence of clear morphological case-marking in the examples provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Kinyarwanda does not utilize a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This section discusses the forms of personal pronouns, including their prefixal and suffixal variants. It also mentions that there are no tense markings in pronouns and that plural pronouns are used for respect or politeness. However, there is no mention of case distinctions in the pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This section explicitly states that ""Koromfe has no cases."" It clarifies that the differences between proclitic (subject and possessive) and postclitic (object) pronouns are purely phonologically determined and not indicative of grammatical cases.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This section discusses prepositions and postpositions, indicating that there are no complex prepositions or postpositions and that pre-/postpositions do not agree with the nouns they govern for any grammatical category. This further supports the absence of a case system in the language.

Given the explicit statement in Paragraph 2 that Koromfe has no cases and the lack of any evidence to the contrary in the other paragraphs, it is clear that Koromfe does not employ a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lango,,no morphological case-marking,
Murle,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Murle, the language exhibits the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative Case**: This marks the subject of a clause. Singular nouns take the suffix -a, while plural nouns take the suffix -i.
2. **Accusative Case**: This marks the object of a clause. The accusative case has no specific marker and is usually understood from the context.
3. **Genitive Case**: This marks possession. Singular nouns take the suffix -u, and plural nouns take the suffix -o.
4. **Locative/Instrumental Case**: This marks location or instrument. Singular nouns take the suffix -a, and plural nouns take the suffix -e.

The grammar explicitly mentions these four cases and provides examples for each, showing their productive use in marking grammatical relations in sentences.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative case is used to mark the subject of a clause.
- The accusative case, though not overtly marked, is understood from the context and is used to mark the object of a clause.
- The genitive case is used to mark possession, with specific suffixes for singular and plural forms.
- The locative/instrumental case is used to mark location or instrument, again with specific suffixes for singular and plural forms.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Nama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nama, we can analyze the case system as follows:

1. **Associative Morphemes**:
   - The language has associative morphemes like ""tii"" (my) and ""sdd"" (your), which function similarly to genitives in other languages. These indicate possession or relation but do not necessarily constitute a full case system.

2. **Subordinative Suffix -a**:
   - The suffix -a is used to mark noun phrases of subordinate status in the sentence. This is analogous to a case morpheme in other languages, indicating a ""marked"" case versus an ""unmarked"" case. However, this does not suggest a rich case system but rather a binary distinction.

3. **Agentive Case**:
   - There is mention of an agentive case marked by -i in certain fixed expressions, but it is not productive across the language.

4. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The primary productive case paradigm involves the use of the subordinative suffix -a, which is used in various grammatical contexts (e.g., equational predicates, direct/indirect objects, temporal expressions).

5. **Lack of Extensive Case System**:
   - The language does not exhibit a wide range of morphological cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it relies on a limited set of suffixes and particles to indicate grammatical relations.

6. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The presence of the subordinative suffix -a and the agentive -i in fixed expressions suggests some level of case-marking, but it is not extensive or fully productive across all nouns and grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**. The language has some case-marking elements, but they are limited and not part of a fully productive case system.",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns. Here are the key points:

1. **Pronouns and Agreement Markers**:
   - Ngiti has a complex system of subject and object pronouns, which can function as clitics and agreement markers on verbs. However, these are not indicative of a case system for nouns but rather a system of pronominal agreement and cliticization.

2. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - There are distinctions between alienable and inalienable possession, with specific possessive pronouns used in each context. These constructions involve possessive pronouns rather than case markers on nouns.

3. **Postpositions**:
   - The language uses postpositions extensively to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and accompaniment. These postpositions can be modified by pronouns and possessive markers but do not constitute a case system for nouns.

4. **Logophoric and Reflexive Pronouns**:
   - The presence of logophoric and reflexive pronouns indicates a sophisticated pronominal system but does not imply a nominal case system.

5. **Indirect Object Pronouns**:
   - There is a separate set of indirect object pronouns, which function similarly to postpositional phrases. This again points to a reliance on pronominal forms and postpositions rather than nominal case marking.

6. **No Evidence of Nominal Case Marking**:
   - Throughout the provided text, there is no mention of morphological case marking on nouns themselves. The relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are mediated through pronouns, agreement markers, and postpositions.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**

The analysis of the provided text indicates that Ngiti does not employ a productive system of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on a combination of pronominal forms, agreement markers, and postpositions to convey grammatical relationships.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Oromo (Harar),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oromo (Harar), we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Absolutive Case**: This is the unmarked case form and serves as the base for other case forms.
2. **Nominative Case**: This case is distinct for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and some demonstratives.
3. **Genitive Case**: This case marks possession and is formed by a high tone on the final vowel of the phrase.
4. **Locative Case**: This case marks a location that is somehow detached from the action of the predicate.
5. **Dative Case**: This case includes two different suffixes and marks the benefactor or source of the action/state of the predicate.
6. **Instrumental Case**: This case marks the means by which an action is performed.

The grammar also discusses other forms like the emphatic subject and various postpositions, but these do not constitute additional productive case paradigms of nouns.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly describes six distinct cases: Absolutive, Nominative, Genitive, Locative, Dative, and Instrumental.
- Each of these cases has specific morphological markers and functions, fitting the definition of grammatical cases as categories of nouns and noun modifiers that correspond to grammatical functions in a sentence.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Sango,,no morphological case-marking,
Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Pronouns and Determiners (Paragraph 1)**:
   - Supyire pronouns do not show sensitivity to case. The same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and possessor.
   - There are no distinct morphological forms for different grammatical functions (e.g., subject vs. object).

2. **Adpositions (Paragraph 2)**:
   - Supyire uses postpositions and prepositions to mark oblique cases (e.g., locative, dative, instrumental).
   - These adpositions are used to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and accompaniment, rather than morphological case-marking on the nouns themselves.

3. **Peripheral Case Roles (Paragraph 3)**:
   - Peripheral roles like benefactive, associative, instrumental, manner, standard of comparison, external locatives, and time are marked using postpositions.
   - These roles are not marked by morphological changes to the nouns but by the addition of postpositions.

### Conclusion:
The evidence from the descriptive grammar indicates that Supyire does not use morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to indicate various grammatical relationships. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Supyire is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Turkana,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkana, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Absolute Case**: This is the unmarked case used for direct objects, indirect objects, and subject noun phrases that are fronted or demoted for pragmatic reasons.
2. **Nominative Case**: Used for subject noun phrases, particularly when they follow the verb.
3. **Genitive Case**: Used for noun phrases functioning as possessors in associative constructions.
4. **Instrumental Case**: Used for noun phrases functioning as instruments or causers in relative clauses.
5. **Locative Case**: There are two types of locative cases:
   - **Locative (1)**: Used for indicating place or direction.
   - **Locative (2)**: Used for indicating source.
6. **Vocative Case**: Used for addressing people.

The grammar explicitly mentions these six cases and provides detailed descriptions of their usage and tonal inflections. There is no mention of additional cases beyond these six, nor is there an indication of exclusively borderline case-marking.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yoruba,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yoruba, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses pronouns and their functions. It mentions that pronouns function as subjects and objects and can occur with qualifiers. However, it does not provide evidence of morphological case marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph introduces ""Polymorphic Nouns,"" which have different forms when functioning as subjects, objects, and genitival qualifiers. This suggests a form of case marking, as the nouns change form based on their syntactic role. Specifically, the forms are:
   - Subject: mo, o, 6 (singular); a, e, won (plural)
   - Object: mi, o, i (singular); wa, yin/iyin, won (plural)
   - Genitival Qualifier: imi, ire, ire (singular); iwa, iyin, iwon (plural)

   This indicates a three-case system: nominative (subject), accusative (object), and genitive (genitival qualifier).

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses genitival qualifiers in more detail, confirming that nouns can function as genitival qualifiers and change form accordingly. It also mentions that the polymorphic nouns have special forms when functioning as genitival qualifiers, reinforcing the presence of a genitive case.

Given this information, Yoruba exhibits a productive case paradigm with three distinct cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Mambai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, the following observations can be made:

1. **Prepositions and Their Use**: The text describes a set of prepositions used in Mambai, which are employed to indicate various locational and relational functions. These prepositions include ""bèè"" (without), ""háá"" (until, up to), ""lâ’"" (like, as), ""má"" (with, and, by, during), ""sáà"" (inside, in), ""sé’"" (except, only, not until), and ""yâg"" (to, for). The prepositions are used to form prepositional phrases that provide additional information about manner, location, and other relational aspects.

2. **Prepositional Phrases**: The structure of prepositional phrases in Mambai involves the preposition being followed by a noun or noun-phrase complement. When the complement is a pronoun, it is typically an independent pronoun, except in the case of the preposition ""yâg,"" which uses an object pronoun.

3. **Lack of Case Marking**: The text does not mention any morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, relational and locational functions are expressed through prepositions. This suggests that Mambai relies on prepositions rather than case inflections to indicate grammatical relationships.

4. **Distribution and Function**: Prepositional phrases are used as verbal modifiers, providing information on manner and location in post-verbal positions. This further supports the idea that prepositions, rather than case markings, are the primary means of indicating grammatical relationships in Mambai.

Given these observations, it is clear that Mambai does not employ a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses prepositions to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Jamsay,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Pronominal Categories and Postpositions**:
   - The description mentions pronominal categories and their expression as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs, proclitic-like particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals. This indicates that pronominal distinctions are made, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a productive case system for nouns.
   - The section on postpositional phrases (PP) indicates that Jamsay uses postpositions to mark relationships such as dative, locative, and instrumental. This suggests that instead of using case endings, Jamsay employs postpositions to indicate these grammatical relationships.

2. **Tonal Locatives**:
   - The mention of tonal locatives formed by grafting an L-tone at the end of certain nouns to indicate locative meaning (e.g., u@ro@ ‘house’, u@ro$ ‘in the house’) suggests a form of locative marking. However, this is a specific and limited type of marking and does not constitute a full-fledged case system.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The evidence points towards the use of postpositions and tonal changes for specific locative meanings rather than a comprehensive morphological case system. The presence of an all-purpose postposition that can function as dative, locative, or instrumental further supports this.
   - Given the information, it appears that Jamsay does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns but rather uses postpositions and tonal modifications for certain grammatical relations.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points that lead to the conclusion:

1. **Explicit Mention of Cases**: The text explicitly mentions that Ik employs eight morphological cases: Nominative, Copulative, Accusative, Ablative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, and Oblique.

2. **Detailed Description**: The grammar provides detailed descriptions and examples of how each of these cases is used in various grammatical contexts, such as marking subjects, objects, and other non-core arguments.

3. **Case Suffixes**: The text lists the suffixes for each case and explains their morphophonological variations, confirming that these cases are indeed productive and integral to the language's grammatical system.

4. **Core and Non-core Arguments**: The cases are used to mark both core arguments (like subjects and objects) and non-core arguments (like instruments and locations), indicating a robust and comprehensive case system.

Given this detailed and explicit information, it is clear that Ik has a fully developed system of eight morphological cases.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Noun Inflection (Paragraph 1)**:
   - The primary focus of noun inflection in Emai is on number marking through prefixes. There is no mention of case-marking for nouns in the traditional sense (nominative, accusative, etc.).
   - The prefixes are used to indicate number (singular/plural) and are associated with a remnant gender system, but there is no indication that these prefixes serve to mark different grammatical cases.

2. **Pronouns and Conjunction (Paragraph 2)**:
   - Emai pronouns reflect distinctions in person, number, gender, and case. The cases mentioned include nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive.
   - The presence of case distinctions in pronouns does not necessarily imply that nouns themselves are marked for these cases. Pronouns often have distinct morphological behaviors compared to nouns.

3. **Overall Analysis**:
   - The descriptive grammar indicates that while pronouns in Emai show case distinctions, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The primary morphological marking on nouns is for number and gender, not for case.
   - The information provided does not suggest the presence of overt case-marking for nouns beyond the genitive case in pronouns, which is not sufficient to classify the language as having a productive case system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Nyimang,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, the language exhibits the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used for the subject of a verb.
2. **Accusative Case**: Indicates the object of a transitive verb.
3. **Genitive Case**: Denotes possession.
4. **Dative Case**: Used as the object of verbs of giving, taking away, asking, telling, and to denote 'for', 'for the good of', 'on behalf of'.
5. **Ablative Case**: Indicates accompaniment, means by which something is done (instrumental), and manner in which something is done.
6. **Locative Case**: Expresses motion to, rest in or at, and motion from a location.

The grammar explicitly mentions these six cases and provides examples of their usage. Therefore, Nyimang has a productive case paradigm with six distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Pronominals and Case Marking**:
   - The pronominal system in Ma'di is quite detailed, with distinctions in person, number, definiteness, and tense/aspect/modality. However, there is no explicit mention of case marking for pronominals in terms of nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the distinctions are more about their syntactic roles (subject, object, etc.) and their positions in the sentence.
   - The pronominal paradigms (U-paradigm, I-paradigm, D-paradigm, NS-paradigm) are based on the verb forms they accompany and their syntactic roles, not on morphological case marking.

2. **Nonverbal Predicates and Postpositions**:
   - The examples provided for nonverbal predicates and postpositions (e.g., benefactive ""ni"") show that relational meanings (such as benefactive, locative, etc.) are expressed through postpositions rather than morphological case marking on nouns.
   - The use of postpositions like ""ni"" for benefactive and ""dri"" for locative indicates that Ma'di relies on postpositional phrases to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

3. **Absence of Morphological Case Marking**:
   - Throughout the provided text, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm where nouns are inflected to indicate their grammatical roles (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).
   - The relational meanings are conveyed through word order, pronominal forms, and postpositions rather than through morphological changes to the nouns themselves.

Given this analysis, it is clear that Ma'di does not employ a morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses syntactic strategies and postpositions to convey grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Seme,,no morphological case-marking,
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can determine the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Unmarked Case for Subject and Object**:
   - The text explicitly states that the distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order, and subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers. This indicates that there is no morphological case-marking for these core grammatical relations.

2. **Postpositions for Other Relations**:
   - The language uses postpositions to express other grammatical relations such as dative (se), possessive (wane), locative (ra and kuna), and others like ga (on, by, from, out of), doo (at the place of), and more concrete spatial postpositions (e.g., banda, beene, dire, etc.).
   - These postpositions function similarly to cases in languages with morphological case-marking, but they are not integrated into a case paradigm of the noun itself. Instead, they are separate morphemes that follow the noun.

3. **Special Forms for Pronouns**:
   - Certain personal pronouns have distinct forms for subject and object functions, and there are special forms for dative pronouns. However, this does not constitute a full case system for nouns but rather a limited set of distinctions for pronouns.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The presence of postpositions for locative, dative, and possessive relations suggests that Koyra Chiini has overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations. However, these are not part of a productive case paradigm for nouns but are separate morphemes that follow the noun.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Koyra Chiini does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to mark various grammatical relations, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is marked by a suffix that replaces the final vowel of the basic stem of a noun.
2. **Accusative Case**: This is marked by a suprafix, which manifests as high pitch on the final vowel segment of the noun stem.
3. **Genitive Case**: This is marked by both a suffix and a suprafix, involving the replacement of the final vowel of the basic stem or the addition of the suffix to the basic stem.
4. **Dative-Locative Case**: This is marked by a suffix that attaches to the basic stem or the genitive stem of a noun.
5. **Allative Case**: This is marked by a suffix that always attaches to the genitive stem of a noun.
6. **Ablative-Instrumental Case**: This is marked by a suffix that always attaches to the genitive stem of a noun.
7. **Oblique Case**: This is marked by a suprafix, which manifests as high pitch on the final vowel segment of the noun stem.

The language Sidaama thus has a productive case paradigm that includes at least seven distinct cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, allative, ablative-instrumental, and oblique.

**Reasoning**: The descriptive grammar explicitly mentions these seven cases, each with specific morphological markers (suffixes or suprafixes). The genitive case is counted as it does not encode categories of the possessum like number or gender and does not show explicit adjective-like properties. The cases are productive and apply to nouns, fulfilling the criteria for grammatical cases.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kunama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kunama, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Inflectional Case Marking**:
   - The text explicitly states that ""Inflectional case is lacking in Kunama unless Banti's tone-marked example proves to be correct: nom. ayld inttke ‘A cow saw him’ vs. ac. ayla kintike ‘He saw a cow’."" This suggests that there is no consistent morphological case marking on nouns, except for a possible tonal distinction which is not confirmed as a productive system.

2. **Use of Postpositions**:
   - The text mentions that categories which can be broadly included under the category of case are realized in Kunama by the use of postpositions. This includes locative, ablative, instrumental, and other relationships typically marked by cases in other languages.
   - Examples include phrases like ""gu'ja+bu ‘by means of a stick’"" and ""koma+la ‘underneath’,"" indicating that spatial and instrumental relations are marked by postpositions rather than inflectional case endings.

3. **Genitive Construction**:
   - The genitive is marked by a suffix -yna, as in ""Possessor + Number of Possessor + Genitive (-9g) + Number of Possessed."" This is a morphological marker but is specific to possessive constructions and does not extend to a broader case system.

4. **Absence of Other Case Markers**:
   - The text does not provide evidence of other productive case markers for nominative, accusative, dative, or other syntactic roles beyond the genitive and the potential tonal distinction.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the reliance on postpositions for marking relationships typically handled by cases and the lack of a productive inflectional case system, Kunama does not exhibit a robust morphological case-marking system.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, the language exhibits a variety of case markers that are used productively to indicate different grammatical relations. Here is a summary of the relevant case markers identified:

1. **Adessive Case**: Marked by the suffix **-kor**. It indicates the location at which an event occurs or the direction towards which an event is directed (e.g., ""at"" or ""to"").
2. **Path Case**: Marked by the suffix **-oha**. It indicates the path along which an action occurs.
3. **Referent Case**: Marked by the suffix **-pne**. It encodes multiple roles including adessive, allative, elative, comitative, efficient cause, and point of reference.
4. **Specific Setting Case**: Marked by the suffix **-n**. It indicates interior location, surface location, adessive, and temporal reference.
5. **General Setting Case**: Marked by the suffix **-nane**. It indicates surface locative, temporal reference, and manner.
6. **Allative Case**: Marked by the suffix **-ko**. It indicates the direction towards which an action is directed.
7. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix **-e**. It indicates the means or manner by which an action is carried out.

These cases are used to mark various grammatical relations and roles within sentences, indicating that Alamblak has a productive case-marking system. The presence of these distinct and productive case markers suggests that Alamblak has a relatively rich case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, Alamblak has **10 or more cases**.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Amele, we can analyze the information to determine the number of cases in the language.

1. **Postpositions and Clitic Particles**: The paragraph mentions several postpositions such as ""na,"" ""ma,"" ""ca,"" ""dec,"" ""dodoc,"" ""sec,"" ""hen,"" and ""we,"" which mark various relationships like location, instrument, possession, direction, and source. These postpositions are used to mark the nominal phrases they follow, indicating that Amele uses postpositions to express grammatical relationships rather than inflectional case markings on the nouns themselves.

2. **Word Order**: The paragraph also highlights the significance of word order in distinguishing subject, indirect object, and direct object. This suggests that syntactic roles are primarily indicated by word order rather than morphological case markings.

3. **Bound Affixes**: There is a mention of bound affixes marking inalienably possessed nouns for person and number, but this does not indicate a productive case system for marking syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, or dative.

4. **Verbal Object Marking**: The clitic object marking on verbs can distinguish direct from indirect objects, further suggesting that syntactic roles are marked on the verb rather than through a case system on the nouns.

Given this information, it appears that Amele does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that marks syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, it relies on postpositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the exact number of cases in Mountain Arapesh due to the lack of explicit information about case marking on nouns. The paragraphs primarily discuss intonation, verb classes, person-number subject prefixes, and object markers, but they do not provide clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The text mentions various verbal affixes and their functions, such as subject and object markers, but there is no mention of noun case markers.
   - The focus is on verbal morphology, including subject and object marking, mood marking, and person-number prefixes.
   - There is no explicit description of a system of noun inflections that would indicate a productive case paradigm.

Given the absence of information on noun case marking, it is reasonable to conclude that Mountain Arapesh does not have a productive case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Asmat,"To determine the number of cases in the Asmat language, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. The paragraphs describe various pronouns and their usage in different contexts, but they do not explicitly mention case markings on nouns.

### Analysis:

1. **Demonstrative Pronouns and Substantives**:
   - The demonstrative pronouns are used with substantives (nouns) to indicate proximity or direction (e.g., ""this bag,"" ""that bag there"").
   - Examples: ""a this bag,"" ""ja esd that bag (with you),"" ""jdka e s i that bag there,"" ""e esi that bag over there.""

2. **Proper Names**:
   - Demonstrative pronouns are also used with proper names to indicate location (e.g., ""here in Jepkm,"" ""the village of KAjmo, away over there"").
   - Examples: ""a J e p h here in Jepkm,"" ""e Kdjmo the village of KAjmo, away over there,"" ""ja Matamjen Matarnjen there, near you.""

3. **Directional Pronouns**:
   - Directional pronouns indicate direction (e.g., ""this way,"" ""that way"").
   - Examples: ""or 6 this way,"" ""er d that way.""

4. **Directional Class**:
   - This class consists of directional pronouns and neutral pronouns that point in a certain direction.
   - Examples: ""a/ar points in a certain direction,"" ""when 6 nor 6 to the forest,"" ""to me.""

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns. The examples given focus on the use of demonstrative and directional pronouns with nouns, but they do not indicate any case inflections or paradigms for the nouns themselves. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Asmat does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Batak (Karo), we can analyze the case system as follows:

1. **Personal Pronouns**: The table lists different forms of personal pronouns categorized as Independent, Possessive, Agentive, and Objective. This suggests that there are distinct forms for different grammatical roles, which is indicative of case marking.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Independent**: aku (I), kita (we inclusive), kami (we exclusive), etc.
   - **Possessive**: -(ng)ku (my), -(n)ta (our inclusive), -ndu (your), etc.
   - **Agentive**: kusikami (we exclusive), -ndu (your), etc.
   - **Objective**: aku (me), kita (us inclusive), kami (us exclusive), etc.

3. **Usage in Sentences**:
   - (4.9) ""Ras aku kam?"" (with me you) - Here, ""aku"" is used in the context of a prepositional phrase.
   - (4.10) ""Ibahanna surat kempak aku."" (He sent a letter to me) - ""aku"" is used as the object of the verb.

From the examples and the table, it is clear that Batak (Karo) has distinct forms for different grammatical roles, which correspond to different cases. Specifically, we can identify:

- **Nominative**: for the subject of a sentence (e.g., ""aku"" for ""I"").
- **Accusative**: for the direct object of a sentence (e.g., ""aku"" for ""me"").
- **Possessive**: for indicating possession (e.g., ""-(ng)ku"" for ""my"").
- **Agentive**: which seems to be used for the agent in certain constructions.

Given the presence of these distinct forms, Batak (Karo) exhibits a productive case paradigm for nouns and pronouns. The identified cases (Nominative, Accusative, Possessive, and Agentive) suggest that the language has at least 4 cases.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns. Here are the key points:

1. **Pronouns and Articles**:
   - The pronouns in Chamorro include subject markers (hu-type, yo'-type), possessive pronouns, and emphatic pronouns. These pronouns function as subject and object markers, and possessive pronouns indicate possession.
   - Articles in Chamorro (si, as, iya, i, ni, nu) are used to mark proper names, places, and common nouns. They also serve to indicate definiteness and function similarly to prepositions in some contexts.

2. **Noun Phrase (NP) Structure**:
   - Noun phrases in Chamorro can include pronouns, proper nouns, common nouns with modifiers, and other nominals.
   - NPs can function as subjects, objects, objects of causatives, objects of prepositions, benefactors, and instruments.

3. **Focus System**:
   - The focus system in Chamorro involves marking the relationship between the verb and a particular substantive phrase. This includes actor focus, goal focus, causative focus, referential focus, and benefactive focus.
   - The focus system uses specific affixes and articles to indicate the role of the noun in the sentence.

4. **Case Marking**:
   - The articles and pronouns in Chamorro serve to mark the syntactic roles of nouns, such as subject, object, and possessive. However, these markers do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense of nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - The use of articles like ni and nu, which can translate to prepositions in English, suggests a system that marks peripheral or semantic relations rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Chamorro does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses articles and pronouns to mark syntactic roles and focus, which aligns more closely with the feature value of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Daga,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Daga, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Location Clitic**: The grammar mentions a Location Clitic that marks location and instrument. Examples include:
   - `pusi-ga-p` (foot-your-lc) ‘on your foot’
   - `puiman-i` (ocean-lc) ‘at the ocean’
   - `kiman-i` (sky-lc) ‘in the sky’

   This clitic appears to be a productive marker for locative and instrumental cases.

2. **Substantive Clitic**: The Substantive Clitic (`-a/-wa`, `-ewa/-awa`) is used to bind words into a nominal unit and can occur on nouns to mark a substantive relationship. However, it does not seem to function as a traditional grammatical case but rather as a nominalizer or marker of a substantive phrase.

3. **Postpositions**: The grammar also mentions the use of postpositions to mark location, comparison, and temporal accompaniment. Examples include:
   - `Waruman gapan` (Waruman at) ‘They slept at Waruman.’
   - `pusi-p` (foot-lc) ‘by foot’

   These postpositions function similarly to cases in marking relational roles but are not integrated into the noun morphology as traditional case markers.

4. **Pronouns and Suffixes**: Pronouns in Daga have possessive forms (`-ga`), purpose forms (`-nan`), emphatic forms (`-k`), and exclusive forms (`-genat` or `-aget`). These suffixes modify pronouns to indicate possession, purpose, emphasis, and exclusivity, respectively. However, these are not cases in the traditional sense but rather pronominal modifications.

5. **Purpose and Location Phrases**: The grammar describes purpose and location phrases with obligatory and optional components, such as the Axis and Relator. These phrases use specific suffixes and postpositions to indicate relational roles, but again, these are not integrated into the noun morphology as traditional cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Daga exhibits overt marking primarily for locative and instrumental relations through clitics and postpositions. There is no evidence of a fully developed case system with multiple productive case paradigms for nouns. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Daga is:

**Exclusively borderline case-marking**.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided text, Dani (Lower Grand Valley) uses a variety of post-positional markers, clitics, and suffixes to indicate semantic relationships, particularly spatial ones. These markers include:

1. **Locative Suffixes**:
   - **-m**: Non-productive, used with a few stems in a locative sense.
   - **-la**: Productive, meaning 'inside' or 'into'.
   - **-ma, -mo**: Productive and common, meaning 'toward', 'at', or 'in'.
   - **-opa, -pa**: Meaning 'on', 'onto', 'at'.
   - **-paka**: Less common, meaning 'at', 'on'.

2. **Directional Clitics**:
   - **-kke, -kkwe**: Indicating direction or route.

3. **Source Clitics**:
   - **-en, -nen**: Indicating 'from which' or 'source'.

4. **Benefactive Relator**:
   - **hesik**: Used to specify the person or situation for whom an action is performed.

These markers are used to indicate various locative, directional, and source relationships, but they do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, they function more like postpositions or adpositions that attach to nouns to convey specific semantic roles.

Given that these markers are primarily used for spatial and some non-spatial relations and do not form a comprehensive case system that marks core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.), Dani (Lower Grand Valley) does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hamtai, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses adjectives and subject pronouns but does not provide evidence of case-marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Describes possessive pronouns and possessive noun phrases. Possession is marked by suffixes like -i'ya, but this does not indicate a broader case system.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Talks about object pronouns and indirect object nouns. Object pronouns are marked with -i, but this is specific to pronouns and does not extend to a general case system for nouns.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions interrogative adverbs and their usage in sentences but does not provide information on case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses clitics like -'ma and -'na, which function as markers for ""concerning"" or ""about"" but do not constitute a productive case system.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Describes locative clitics such as -u, -i, -m, -'na, and -nta, which are used to indicate location or direction. These are more akin to adpositions rather than a full-fledged case system.

The locative clitics indicate specific spatial or directional relationships but do not form a comprehensive case system that marks syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, or dative. Therefore, Hamtai exhibits overt marking primarily for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, rather than a full productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hua, the language exhibits a productive case system with multiple distinct case suffixes. Here is a summary of the cases identified:

1. **Nominative (Absolutive)**: This is the unmarked case used for subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect objects of (di)transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal compounds. It is marked by the suffix ø or -a in citation form.

2. **Ergative**: This case is used for subjects of (di)transitive verbs. It has distinct forms in the singular (-mu') and plural (-mi).

3. **Locative/Allative**: This case describes both position and motion towards an object or person, marked by suffixes like -ro' ~ -roga.

4. **Inessive/Illative**: This case describes both position and motion into an object or person, marked by suffixes like -vi' ~ -vina ~ -vinga.

5. **Ablative**: This case describes motion away from an object or person, marked by suffixes like -roti' ~ -rogari'.

6. **Elative**: This case describes motion out of an object or person, marked by suffixes like -viti' ~ -vingari'.

7. **Benefactive**: This case indicates the beneficiary of an action, marked by the suffix -hi'.

8. **Comitative**: This case indicates accompaniment, marked by the suffix -Ki'.

9. **Genitive**: This case indicates possession, marked by the suffix -ma' for singular and -'i' for plural.

10. **Vocative**: Although traditionally considered a case, it is syntactically distinct and used for direct address, marked by the suffix -e or -o.

Given the detailed description of these cases and their productive use in the language, Hua clearly has a robust case system.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Ilocano,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, we can analyze the case system as follows:

1. **Pronouns and Case Marking:**
   - Ilocano pronouns inflect for three cases: **ergative**, **absolutive**, and **oblique**. This is evident from the discussion of the independent and enclitic pronouns, which are categorized into these three cases.
   - The **ergative** case is used to mark the actor of a transitive verb and possession.
   - The **absolutive** case is used for the single argument of intransitive verbs and the patient (object) of transitive verbs.
   - The **oblique** case is used for non-core arguments, indicating direction, location, or other peripheral roles.

2. **Articles and Case Marking:**
   - Articles in Ilocano also inflect for two cases: **core** and **oblique**. The core case includes both ergative and absolutive roles, while the oblique case marks peripheral roles.
   - The core case is used for arguments that can be replaced by enclitic pronouns, while the oblique case is used for non-verbal arguments.

3. **Noun Phrases:**
   - Noun phrases in Ilocano are marked for case by articles or demonstratives, which distinguish between core and oblique cases.
   - The distinction between core and oblique cases is crucial in determining the grammatical function of noun phrases within sentences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Ilocano has a productive case system with three distinct cases: **ergative**, **absolutive**, and **oblique**. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Ilocano in terms of the number of cases is:

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, the language exhibits a productive case-marking system with specific morphological markers for different semantic roles. Here is the breakdown of the cases identified:

1. **Unmarked NP**: Subjects and certain objects are unmarked, but objects can be marked with -m under specific conditions.
2. **Locative/Causal**: Marked by -ia, indicating location and cause.
3. **Source**: Marked by -n&i, indicating the source.
4. **Instrumental**: Marked by -na, indicating the instrument.
5. **Goal**: Marked by -m, indicating the goal and sometimes marking objects.

The grammar explicitly mentions five case markers: -ia (locative/causal), -n&i (source), -na (instrumental), and -m (goal/object). These markers are used to indicate the semantic roles of peripheral NPs, which do not belong to the predicate frame and thus need overt marking.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",5 cases,5 cases
Atayal,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is used for the subject of a sentence. Examples include:
   - ""MU qu' cyux mahugq lukus hiya’"" (My aunt is the one who is washing clothes).
   - ""QUTUX SAKU' BALAY HI’ qu hmkanji'"" (I was walking alone).

2. **Genitive Case**: This is used to indicate possession. Examples include:
   - ""Ikotas mu maray pehu'"" (my late Grandfather Maray Pehu).
   - ""Ikaki mu lawa' ciyan"" (my late Grandmother Lawa’ Ciyang).

3. **Dative Case**: This is used for the indirect object of a verb and the object of certain prepositions. Examples include:
   - ""yaya’ maku' kmaN knan la"" (My mother talked to me).
   - ""ima' qsu' mwah kraya’ mwah mita’ knan ga’, sazij kinshat"" (Who first came up (to the road) to see me? It was two policemen).

From the analysis, it is clear that Atayal has three distinct productive case paradigms for nouns: nominative, genitive, and dative. There is no indication of additional cases beyond these three in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kewa, we can identify several productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the analysis:

1. **Subject Tagmemes**: The subject tagmemes in Kewa include various semantic roles such as Agent (AGN), Actor (ATR), Topic (TOP), Goal (GOL), Instrument (IN), Action (ATN), and Location (LOC). These roles are marked by specific morphological markers attached to the nouns.

2. **Object Tagmemes**: The object tagmemes include Goal (GOL), Recipient (REC), Action (ATN), Location (LOC), Beneficiary (BEN), and Direction (DIR). These roles are also marked by specific morphological markers.

3. **Complement Tagmemes**: Complement tagmemes function semantically as Instrument (IN), Location (LOC), Quality (QAL), Size (SZ), Colour (COL), and Negative (NEG). These roles are marked by specific morphological markers.

4. **Axis-Relator Phrases**: These phrases indicate relationships such as locative (LOC), instrumental (IN), and directive (DIR) among others, marked by clitics like -para (LOC), -me (IN), and -nane (DIR).

5. **Case Markers**: The text explicitly mentions case markers such as:
   - **Agentive/Instrumentive**: -me
   - **Genitive**: -na
   - **Locative**: -para
   - **Accusative**: -daa
   - **Directive**: -nane

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Kewa has a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: Agentive/Instrumentive, Genitive, Locative, Accusative, Directive, and Benefactive. Therefore, the number of cases in Kewa falls within the range of 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kobon,"To determine the number of cases in Kobon, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the analysis based on the given text:

1. **Pronoun Forms and Functions**:
   - The text discusses various pronoun forms and their functions, such as subject, direct object, indirect object, benefactive, and accompanier. These functions are typically associated with different cases in languages that use case marking.
   - The pronouns are marked for person, number (singular, dual, plural), and sometimes for social distance, but there is no explicit mention of case markers for these pronouns.

2. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Examples like ""Lemli possfather"" and ""Hibus 3poss mother"" indicate possessive constructions. The possessive marker ""poss"" suggests a genitive case, but it is not clear if this is a productive case paradigm or a fixed possessive construction.

3. **Verbal Suffixes and Functions**:
   - The text mentions verbal suffixes that indicate subject and object relationships, such as ""go-fut-12"" (future tense with first and second person). This suggests that verb conjugation might carry some of the functional load typically handled by cases in other languages.

4. **Lack of Explicit Case Marking**:
   - There is no explicit mention of morphological case markers for nouns in the text. The functions that might be marked by cases in other languages (e.g., subject, object, possessive) seem to be handled by pronoun forms and verbal suffixes.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Kobon. The language appears to rely on pronoun forms and verbal suffixes to indicate grammatical relationships, rather than morphological case marking on nouns.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kombai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, we can analyze the morphological case-marking of nouns in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a general overview of Kombai as a Papuan language and mentions its nominal morphology. It states that the nominal morphology is simple and that nouns (including kinship terms) have no non-singular forms. However, it does not provide specific information about case-marking.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses various aspects of Kombai grammar, including negative predicates, quote-marking verb clitics, and the morphology of nouns and pronouns. Specifically, it states:
   - ""Apart from the expression of possession there is no noun-related morphology.""
   - ""Functionally, nouns are the unmarked heads of noun phrases (NP).""
   - ""There is no derivation of nouns from verbs or other categories.""

The key point here is that there is no noun-related morphology apart from possessive pronominal prefixes. This strongly suggests that Kombai does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The possessive pronominal prefixes are used to indicate possession, but there is no mention of other case markers such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Kombai exhibits **No morphological case-marking** for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can identify the following case-marking features:

1. **Locative Suffix (-n)**: The locative suffix is used to indicate general static location, both temporal and spatial. It is applied to a restricted subclass of nouns, including time nouns, place names, body parts, place nouns, positional nouns, and other miscellaneous nouns. Examples include ""kunuhanin"" (afternoon-LOC), ""Goaen"" (Isabel-LOC), and ""gatan"" (top of head-LOC).

2. **Perlative Suffix (-ne)**: The perlative suffix indicates motion through some material or terrain or along a line. It is less common and appears with nouns compatible with the locative suffix. Examples include ""oraravane"" (side-PERL) and ""o'asene"" (bush-PERL).

3. **Postpositions**: The language also uses postpositions to form locational phrases, such as ""ena"" (in) and ""ham"" (for). These postpositions can be used with nouns that do not take the locative or perlative suffixes.

From the information provided, it is clear that Lavukaleve has productive case paradigms for at least two cases: the locative and the perlative. These cases are used to mark specific semantic relations (location and motion through/along). Additionally, the use of postpositions for other locational phrases suggests that the language does not rely solely on case suffixes for all locational expressions.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Lavukaleve based on the provided data is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Madurese, we can make the following observations:

1. **No Case Marking on NPs**: The text explicitly states that there is no case marking on noun phrases (NPs) in Madurese, with the exception of the first person singular possessive. This indicates that nouns do not change form based on their grammatical role in the sentence.

2. **Same Pronominal Forms for Any Grammatical Role**: The examples provided (69-72) illustrate that the same pronominal forms are used regardless of whether the pronoun is the subject, object, or part of a prepositional phrase. This further supports the absence of a case system.

3. **Possessive Marking**: The only exception mentioned is the first person singular possessive, which does not constitute a productive case paradigm for nouns but rather a specific possessive construction.

Given these points, it is clear that Madurese does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,,no morphological case-marking,
Palauan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Palauan, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses the use of relational phrases, pronouns, and various syntactic structures without indicating a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The relational phrases and pronouns are used to indicate relationships such as possession, location, direction, and cause, but these do not constitute a morphological case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Pronouns and Possessives**:
   - The text describes four series of personal pronouns with different forms for emphasis, possession, and subject use. These forms are not explicitly described as cases but rather as different pronoun forms for various grammatical functions.
   - The possessive forms are mentioned, but they are treated as part of the pronoun system rather than a separate case system.

2. **Postpositional Phrases**:
   - Sentani uses postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. Examples include ""ifa na"" (in the canoe), ""bu na"" (in the water), and ""jo da"" (to the village).
   - These postpositional constructions suggest that Sentani relies on postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate grammatical relationships.

3. **Near Relationship Terms**:
   - Terms like ""father"" and ""mother"" have special possessive-determined forms (e.g., ""ako"" for ""father"" and ""naka"" for ""mother""), which are described as ""flexional"" but are not indicative of a broader case system.

4. **Coordination and Repetition**:
   - The text describes coordination of words and syntactical repetition but does not mention case-marking in these contexts.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Sentani does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships, and the variations in pronoun forms are not sufficient to constitute a case system. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Sentani is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the Suena grammar, we can observe the following:

1. There is a mention of locative affixation for common nouns to show location (e.g., ""emara"" for ""in the house"").
2. There are possessive forms indicated by suffixes (e.g., ""Zaipora"" for ""Zaipo's"").
3. There are indirect object markers (e.g., ""Zaipo-to"" for ""to Zaipo"").
4. There are various other relational markers such as those for coordination, instruments, and benefactives.

These markers suggest that Suena has a system of morphological case-marking for nouns, specifically for locative, possessive, indirect object, and other relational functions. However, the exact number of cases is not explicitly stated in the provided text. Given the evidence of multiple relational markers, it is reasonable to conclude that Suena has a productive case system.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of locative, possessive, and indirect object markers indicates a morphological case system.
- The variety of relational markers suggests more than just a minimal case system.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",4 cases,6-7 cases
Taba,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taba, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Prepositions and Postpositions**:
   - Taba uses prepositions such as ""ada"" (comitative/instrumental), ""pake"" (instrumental), ""untuk"" (beneficiary), and ""lo"" (similative). These prepositions are used to mark relationships like comitative, instrumental, and beneficiary.
   - The locative postposition ""li"" is used to indicate location (e.g., 'in', 'at', 'on').

2. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Possessive noun phrases in Taba are formed by preposing a possessor noun to a possessed noun, linked by a possessive particle that is cross-referenced with the number and person of the possessor.
   - Examples include ""yak nik baba"" (my father) and ""buang ni oto"" (Buang's car).

3. **Pronouns and Cross-referencing**:
   - Taba has independent pronouns and possessive ligatures that mark person and number but do not indicate case in the traditional sense.
   - Actor cross-referencing proclitics are used with verbs to indicate the subject.

4. **Absence of Traditional Case Marking**:
   - The provided text does not mention any morphological case marking on nouns themselves. Instead, relationships that might be marked by case in other languages are indicated by prepositions, postpositions, and possessive particles.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that Taba uses prepositions and postpositions to indicate relationships that might otherwise be marked by case, and there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns, it is appropriate to conclude that Taba does not have morphological case marking in the traditional sense.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tagalog, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Marked Nouns and Pronouns**:
   - Tagalog has three classes of marked nouns: personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns.
   - Personal pronouns have different forms depending on their function in the sentence: ang form (nominative/topic), ng form (genitive/actor), and sa form (locative/directional).
   - Deictic pronouns also have ang, ng, and sa forms.
   - Personal nouns are marked by si (nominative/topic), ni (genitive/actor), and kay (locative/directional).

2. **Case Functions**:
   - The **ang** form is used for topics, which often correspond to the nominative case in other languages.
   - The **ng** form is used for actors in non-topic positions, which corresponds to the genitive or ergative case.
   - The **sa** form is used for locative or directional complements, which corresponds to the locative or dative case.

3. **Case Paradigms**:
   - The personal pronouns have distinct forms for nominative (ang), genitive (ng), and locative (sa) cases.
   - Deictic pronouns and personal nouns also follow this pattern with distinct forms for each case function.

4. **Productivity**:
   - The case-marking system is productive and applies consistently across different types of nouns and pronouns.
   - The system distinguishes between at least three different cases: nominative (ang), genitive (ng), and locative (sa).

### Conclusion: 3 cases

Tagalog has a productive case-marking system with three distinct cases: nominative (ang), genitive (ng), and locative (sa). This system is applied consistently to personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns.",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tukang Besi, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Core Articles and Case Marking**:
   - Tukang Besi uses two core articles: **na** (nominative) and **te** (non-nominative).
   - The nominative article **na** marks a unique position in the clause, specifically the nominative pivot.
   - The non-nominative article **te** is used for non-nominative core arguments, fronted core arguments with nominative case, predicates of non-verbal clauses, topicalized core arguments, and arguments in the [Cause] role for certain bodily sensations.

2. **Oblique Articles**:
   - The oblique article **i/di** is used for marking oblique NPs, which can serve various roles such as locative, allative, ablative, temporal, and cause of emotional or physical state.

3. **Genitive Article**:
   - The genitive article **nu** (with variants no and u) is used for marking possession within noun phrases.

4. **Case Phrase Structure**:
   - The structure of noun phrases in Tukang Besi involves the use of these articles to mark different grammatical relations. The nominative and non-nominative articles are used within the core of the clause, while the oblique and genitive articles are used for marking more peripheral relations.

5. **Morphological Case-Marking**:
   - The language exhibits a clear system of morphological case-marking with specific articles indicating nominative, non-nominative, oblique, and genitive cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided text, Tukang Besi has a productive case paradigm with distinct morphological markers for different grammatical relations. The language uses specific articles to mark at least four different cases: nominative, non-nominative, oblique, and genitive.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Una,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Una, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Vocative Case**: Marked by suffixes **-e** and **se**.
2. **Ergative Case**: Marked by suffixes **-nyi**, **beji**, **aji**, and **-ci**.
3. **Dative Case**: Marked by suffixes **-nyi** and **-siy**.
4. **Nominative Case**: Marked by suffix **asiy**.
5. **Genitive Case**: Indicated by a personal pronoun prefixed to a noun.
6. **Locative Case**: Marked by suffix **aji** (and **aji kuboka** for ablative meaning).
7. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by suffix **aji**.
8. **Referential Case**: Marked by suffix **-ti**.
9. **Reflexive Case**: Marked by suffix **-baramnyi**.

These cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic relationships, including subject marking (nominative), object marking (ergative and dative), possession (genitive), location (locative), means (instrumental), reference (referential), and reflexive actions (reflexive).

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",no morphological case-marking,10 or more cases
Usan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Usan, we can identify several key points regarding case marking:

1. **Nominal Modifiers and Postpositions**:
   - Usan uses postpositions to express various grammatical relations such as locative, instrumental, and comitative. For example, the postposition **-t** is used for locative, time, instrument, beneficiary, cause, and purpose (Paragraph 6).
   - The comitative relations are marked by postpositions **nob** and **ten** (Paragraph 4).

2. **Possessive Pronouns**:
   - Possessive pronouns precede the possessed noun and are used to indicate possession (Paragraph 1).

3. **Object Prefixes**:
   - Usan uses object prefixes to cross-reference animate objects in verbs (Paragraph 5).

4. **Affixation**:
   - The language has a rich verbal morphology but limited non-verbal affixation, primarily using the postpositional clitic **-t** for various semantic functions (Paragraph 6).

5. **Reduplication**:
   - Reduplication is used for various grammatical and semantic purposes, but it does not seem to be related to case marking (Paragraph 6).

6. **Semantic Functions**:
   - Various semantic roles such as goal, recipient, beneficiary, instrument, locative, reason, and comitative are expressed through postpositions and other grammatical constructions (Paragraph 7).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Usan does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive directly on nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on postpositions to indicate various semantic roles. This suggests that Usan has **Exclusively borderline case-marking**, where overt marking is primarily for peripheral or semantic relations rather than core syntactic functions.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, the language has a single nominal case marker, the oblique suffix -n or -nan. This suffix is used to mark a range of peripheral, adverbial-like case uses, such as instruments, locatives, and temporals. The description indicates that this is the only productive case paradigm for nouns in Yimas.

The oblique suffix -n/-nan is applied to nouns to indicate various peripheral roles, but there is no mention of other case markers for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive. The examples provided show the use of the oblique suffix in different contexts, but they do not introduce any additional case markers.

Given this information, Yimas does not have a system of multiple productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies on a single case marker to indicate a variety of peripheral roles.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Aghu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses the optional non-inflectional case markers ""te"" (NOM) and ""ke"" (ACC). These markers are used to indicate the subject and object, respectively. The examples provided show their usage in both transitive and intransitive sentences.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides a detailed overview of the postpositional case markers in Aghu. The table lists the following cases:
   - **te** (NOM) for subjects
   - **ke(mu)** (ACC) for patients, recipients, targets, locations, or certain temporal expressions
   - **ni** (DAT) for beneficiaries, purposes, addressees, or non-patient-like complements of certain verbs
   - **fini / namu** (INSTR) for instruments or source materials, and certain temporal expressions
   - **kumu** (COM) for comitative relations

From this information, we can identify at least five distinct productive case paradigms for nouns in Aghu: nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, and comitative. These cases are used to mark various syntactic and semantic relations between noun phrases and predicates.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of nominative (te), accusative (ke), dative (ni), instrumental (fini/namu), and comitative (kumu) markers indicates that Aghu has a system of productive case paradigms.
- The markers are used to indicate core grammatical functions (subject, object) as well as peripheral relations (beneficiary, instrument, comitative).

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Manambu, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Manambu has a system of case marking that includes several cases.
   - Table 3.5 lists various cases such as the accusative/locative case (-Vm), dative-aversive case (-Vk), allative-instrumental case (-Vr), terminative case (-Vb), comitative case (-wa), transport cases (-Vsap, -Vsay), and substitutive case (-yæy).
   - The text mentions that there are three locative cases: unmarked, locative case, and terminative case.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Manambu has nine case forms, each corresponding to a form.
   - The text distinguishes between nine cases by form and eighteen cases by function.
   - Core cases mark grammatical relations on a basic object–non-object principle.
   - The comitative case is noted for its complexity and multiple functions.

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - The summary in section 7.10 reiterates that Manambu has nine case forms.
   - The text discusses a ""lumper"" approach (nine cases) versus a ""splitter"" approach (eighteen cases).
   - The ""lumper"" approach is considered more economical and captures semantic and syntactic connections between different case meanings and uses.
   - The ""splitter"" approach separates different meanings and functions of the same form.

Given the information, it is clear that Manambu has a productive case system with nine distinct case forms. These forms are used to mark various grammatical relations and functions, including core grammatical relations and several oblique functions.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can identify several productive case markers used with nouns. Here are the key points:

1. **LOC-marked NPs**: The examples (60) to (63) show the use of the locative case marker ""-ta"" to indicate location or direction. This is a clear indication of a locative case.

2. **CS-marked NPs**: The subject arguments can be marked with a CS marker, as mentioned in the description of subject arguments. This suggests a case marking for subjects, although it is sensitive to semantic and pragmatic factors.

3. **INSTR-marked NPs**: The instrumental case marker ""-ka"" is used to indicate the instrument with which an action is performed, as seen in examples (65) and (66).

4. **CNCL-marked NPs**: The inner/concealing location marker ""-ra"" is used to indicate an inner locative or container/instrument role, as seen in example (69).

5. **BEN-marked NPs**: The benefactive case marker ""-ya"" is used to indicate the beneficiary of an action, as seen in examples (184) and (186).

6. **SPEC-marked NPs**: The specificity marker ""-na"" is used to indicate specificity, as seen in examples (186) and (187).

7. **Possessive marking**: The possessive relation is indicated by the use of possessive pronouns and possessive phrases, which can also bear locative marking, as seen in example (187).

From these observations, we can conclude that Duna has a productive case system with at least the following cases:
- Locative
- Instrumental
- Benefactive
- Specificity (though this might be more of a determiner than a case marker)
- Possessive (if we consider possessive marking as part of the case system)

Given the variety of cases identified, it is reasonable to categorize Duna as having 6-7 cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Ergative Case**:
   - The language marks the subject of a transitive verb with an ergative case clitic, which varies based on gender and number. This is a clear indication of a productive case paradigm for marking the ergative case.

2. **Peripheral Cases**:
   - The language has five peripheral cases: possessive, locative, ablative, perlative, and dative. These cases mark various semantic relationships such as possession, location, movement, and recipient roles. Each of these cases has distinct markers that are attached to noun phrases, indicating a productive case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, Taiap has a total of six cases: ergative, possessive, locative, ablative, perlative, and dative. Therefore, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Taiap is:

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mian,"To determine the number of cases in the Mian language based on the provided paragraphs, we need to look for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. The paragraphs provided focus on postpositions and quantifiers, which are not directly indicative of case systems but can provide some context.

### Analysis:

1. **Postpositions**:
   - The language uses postpositions such as ""baka"" (with), ""y"" (at, to), and ""su"" (near).
   - Examples show that these postpositions can attach to nouns, but this does not necessarily indicate case marking. Instead, it suggests the use of adpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

2. **Quantifiers**:
   - The section on quantifiers does not mention any case marking on nouns. It discusses the placement of quantifiers relative to nouns and the agreement of numerals in gender with the nouns they count.

### Reasoning:
- The paragraphs provided do not show any evidence of morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages are indicated by postpositions.
- There is no mention of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, or other traditional cases.
- The use of postpositions suggests that Mian might rely on these rather than a case system to indicate grammatical relationships.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, Mian appears to have **No morphological case-marking**.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Inanwatan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can analyze the presence and type of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Postpositions**:
   - The language uses a number of postpositional clitics to express semantic relations of peripheral NPs to the predicate, such as `-wai` (towards), `-tewe` (from), `-wo` (in, at), `-ra` (to, for), `-(u)ru` (with), and `-go` (a general circumstantial postposition). These postpositions indicate that Inanwatan uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to denote relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

2. **Core Nominals**:
   - Core nominals (subject, object) are unmarked phrases and do not take postpositions. They are distinguished by word order and are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes. This suggests that there is no morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations (subject and object).

3. **Peripheral Nominals**:
   - Peripheral nominals take postpositions and are not cross-referenced in the verb. This further supports the idea that Inanwatan relies on postpositions rather than case inflections to indicate relationships.

4. **Personal Pronouns**:
   - The opposition between subject and object is expressed in the form of personal pronouns, but this does not extend to a full case system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
Given the reliance on postpositions for expressing semantic relations and the lack of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations, Inanwatan does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate relationships, which aligns with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, we can derive the following information regarding the presence of grammatical cases:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It explicitly states that ""nouns inflect only for possessor"" and ""no case inflection of NPs, no gender.""
   - Further, it mentions, ""There is no case in Abui, grammatical relations are signalled with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb construction.""

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It reiterates that ""the nominal category displays only possessive inflection; similar to other Papuan languages, inflections for case or number are not found.""
   - The possessive construction is described in detail, showing that possession is marked by pronominal prefixes rather than case inflections.

Given this information, it is clear that Abui does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, grammatical relations are indicated through other means such as pronominal prefixes and serial verb constructions.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, the language exhibits the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Unmarked Case**: This is used for subjects and predicate NPs.
2. **Object Case**: Marked by suffixes -re/-te for nouns and -el/-ol for pronouns and nouns marked for number.
3. **Instrumental/Comitative Case**: Marked by the suffix -k, which is always attached to a form with Object marking.
4. **Possessive Case**: Marked by the suffix -ke/-ka, occurring on pronouns and nouns with number marking.
5. **Locative Case**: Marked by suffixes -ke/-ko/-ka after vowels and -e/-o/-a after consonants, indicating location or direction.
6. **Vocative Case**: Marked by suffixes -wo/-a, used to attract the attention of the addressee.

These cases are clearly defined and productive within the language, covering a range of syntactic and semantic functions. The presence of these six distinct cases (Unmarked, Object, Instrumental/Comitative, Possessive, Locative, and Vocative) indicates that Awtuw has a robust case-marking system.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in the language:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: There are possessive constructions such as ""An-tar"" (2SG-possess) in the example ""Where is your garden?"" which indicates possession but does not necessarily imply a productive case paradigm.

2. **Prepositions**: The language uses a variety of prepositions to indicate spatial, temporal, and other relationships. Examples include ""bari"" (from), ""ku"" (to, at, in), ""ma"" (to, at, in), ""pu"" (to, at, in), and ""si"" (to). These prepositions are used extensively to mark relations that might be marked by cases in other languages.

3. **Locative Phrases**: There are locative phrases that use prepositions combined with spatial nouns, such as ""be"" (LOC) and ""fe"" (LOC). Examples include ""N-un ku Akmur"" (3SF-go to Akmuri) and ""N-jap ma war"" (3SF-stay at river).

4. **Spatial Orientation**: The language employs spatial relator nouns to specify spatial orientation, such as ""bwan"" (hole), ""dir"" (rib), and ""dumom"" (front). These are used in combination with prepositions to form locative phrases.

5. **Absence of Case Endings**: There is no evidence of morphological case endings on nouns that would indicate a productive case system. Instead, relationships are marked by prepositions and spatial nouns.

6. **Genitive and Dative-Like Constructions**: There are genitive-like constructions (e.g., ""a-pem pa"" for ""her pubic hair"") and dative-like constructions (e.g., ""A-y-aw N-dat-bur"" for ""he escapes""). However, these do not form a productive case paradigm but rather are specific constructions.

Given the extensive use of prepositions to mark relationships and the absence of morphological case endings on nouns, Mpur does not exhibit a productive case system. Instead, it relies on prepositions and spatial nouns to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Locative/Instrumental Clitic =k**:
   - The clitic =k functions as a case marker for locative and instrumental roles. It is used to mark locations (e.g., ""village=LOC"" in example 230) and instruments (e.g., ""spear=INS"" in example 237).
   - The clitic is productive and appears in various contexts, including locative expressions, instrumental expressions, temporal adjuncts, and complements of verbs meaning 'become'.

2. **Absence of Other Case Markers**:
   - The text explicitly states that subjects and objects are not marked for their roles in the clause, except for personal pronouns. This indicates that there is no nominative or accusative case marking for nouns.
   - There is no mention of other case markers such as genitive, dative, or ablative in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Relational Nouns**:
   - The relational nouns listed in Table 35 function similarly to postpositions and are inherently locative or directional (e.g., 'under/within', 'towards'). These do not constitute a productive case system but rather function as relational markers.

Given the information, Mehek has a productive case paradigm for locative and instrumental roles marked by the clitic =k. However, there is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms for other grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, genitive, or dative.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, we can make the following observations:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The text mentions that Abun uses prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking.
   - It also states that there is very little inflectional affixation and that particles are the main means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The text explicitly states that ""No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject.""
   - It further clarifies that both subjects and objects in Abun are encoded by word order alone, without any case marking.

From these observations, it is clear that Abun does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, grammatical relations such as subject and object are indicated through word order and the use of particles.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati indicate that the language has a productive case system with specific suffixes marking different grammatical functions of nouns. The text explicitly lists the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: Marked by the suffix -k, used for the subject of a transitive verb and the experiencer of a stative verb.
2. **Accusative**: Marked by the suffix -in, used for the object of a transitive verb and certain locative expressions.
3. **Autonomous**: No suffix, used in citations, as the form for dative cross-referencing prefixes, as the object of a postposition, and as a vocative for nouns without a true vocative case.
4. **Locative**: Marked by the suffix -fa, indicating the location where an action takes place.
5. **Allative**: Marked by the suffix -fon, indicating motion towards a noun.
6. **Inessive**: Marked by the suffix -hayo, indicating location within an area with a conceivable boundary.
7. **Vocative**: Marked by deleting the final vowel of the noun, or the segment -ka if the noun ends in it, used with proper names and certain kinship terms.

The text also mentions that no noun occurs with more than six cases, but it lists seven distinct cases. This indicates that the case system is robust and productive, covering a range of syntactic and semantic functions.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Maricopa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maricopa, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Case Suffixes**: Maricopa uses several case suffixes to mark the grammatical roles of noun phrases within a sentence. These include:
   - **-sh**: Subject, predicate noun.
   - **0 (zero marking)**: Object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject of predicate nominal and nominalized clauses.
   - **-m**: Comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topic of', 'by way of', directional.
   - **-li**: Locative (at) and illative (to/toward).
   - **-ly**: Locative (in/on) and illative (into/to).
   - **-k**: General locative and directional.

2. **Usage of Case Markers**: The case markers are used to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles of noun phrases:
   - **-sh** is used for subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbs, and for predicate nouns in nominal constructions.
   - **Zero marking** is used for objects, possessors, and subjects of nominalized clauses.
   - **-m** has multiple functions including marking comitative, instrumental, material, topic of communication, and temporal roles.
   - **-li, -ly, and -k** are used for locative and directional roles, with specific nuances for each suffix.

3. **Optionality and Cliticization**: The oblique case markers (-m, -k, -ly, and -li) are optional and can sometimes cliticize to the verb, indicating a flexible and context-dependent use of case marking.

4. **Locational Nouns**: Maricopa also uses locational nouns that can be case-marked to express more specific locations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed description of the case-marking system in Maricopa, it is evident that the language has a productive case paradigm with multiple distinct cases. The cases include subject, object, comitative, instrumental, locative, illative, and directional roles, among others. This indicates a relatively rich case system.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Sierra Miwok, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is marked by a zero suffix or the suffix |-?| depending on the phonological environment.
2. **Accusative Case**: Marked by the suffix |-j|.
3. **Temporal Case**: Marked by the suffix |-n|.
4. **Vocative Case**: Marked by the suffix |-?| or zero.
5. **Genitive Case**: Marked by the suffix |-y| or |-n°-|, with some additional complexities in its usage.
6. **Ablative Case**: Marked by the suffix |-m-|.
7. **Allative Case**: Marked by the suffix |-t-| or |-tHo-|.
8. **Locative Case**: Marked by the suffix |-m-|.
9. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by the suffix |-Hs-|.

Given these identified cases, Southern Sierra Miwok has a productive case system with more than 8 distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct morphological markers for at least nine different grammatical cases.
- Each case has a specific suffix or set of suffixes associated with it, indicating a productive case-marking system.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Nez Perce,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nez Perce, the language exhibits a rich system of case marking. Here is a detailed breakdown of the cases identified:

1. **Unmarked Case**: Nez Perce has unmarked cases for subjects of intransitive verbs and some other constructions.
2. **Ergative/Genitive Case**: The ergative case is marked by suffixes like -nim/-nm/-m and is used for subjects of transitive verbs. The genitive case also uses these suffixes and marks possession.
3. **Direct Object Case**: The direct object is marked by the suffix -ne.
4. **Ablative Case**: The ablative case is marked by suffixes like -pkin'ix/-kin'ix and -me, indicating movement away from a location.
5. **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by the suffix -pe, indicating location.
6. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is marked by the suffix -ki, indicating the means by which an action is performed.
7. **Associative Case**: The associative case is marked by the suffix -iin, indicating accompaniment.
8. **Benefactive Case**: The benefactive case is marked by the suffix -'ayn, indicating the beneficiary of an action.
9. **Allative Case**: The allative case is marked by suffixes like -px/-x and -kex, indicating movement towards a location.
10. **Resultative Case**: The resultative case is marked by the suffix -wecet, indicating a result or reason.
11. **Temporal Case**: The temporal case is marked by the suffix -met, indicating time-related meanings.

Given this detailed system, Nez Perce has a productive case paradigm with more than ten distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Oneida,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oneida, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. The paragraphs detail various noun formation processes, possessive prefixes, and noun suffixes, including locative and plural suffixes. Here are the key points relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Deverbal Nouns and Syntactic Nouns**: These sections describe how nouns are formed from verbs and how they can function as actors or objects. This indicates a rich morphological process but does not directly address case-marking.

2. **Possessive Prefixes**: The possessive prefixes indicate possession but do not serve as case markers in the traditional sense (e.g., nominative, accusative, etc.).

3. **Noun Suffixes**: This section is crucial as it lists various suffixes with specialized meanings:
   - **Locative Suffixes**: Suffixes like -ke, -hne, -aku, -oku, and -akta indicate location (e.g., 'on the car', 'in the car', 'under the car', 'near the car'). These are clear markers of locative cases.
   - **Plural Suffixes**: Suffixes like -shuha, -shu, and -hokw/-hokiha indicate plurality but do not function as traditional grammatical cases.
   - **Population Suffixes**: Suffixes like -(4)akd and -h/o‘/i indicate groups of people or specialization but are not case markers.
   - **Customary, Augment, Decessive, and Characterizer Suffixes**: These suffixes add semantic meaning (e.g., 'large', 'former possession', 'characterization') but do not function as grammatical cases.

From the analysis, it is evident that Oneida has overt marking for locative relations but lacks a broader system of grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. The locative suffixes are the primary indicators of case-like marking, but they are limited to specific locative functions.

### Reasoning:
- The language has specific suffixes for locative functions, which are concrete or peripheral case relations.
- There is no evidence of a broader productive case paradigm for nouns beyond these locative markers.
- Other suffixes and prefixes serve different grammatical or semantic functions but do not constitute a case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southeastern Pomo, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Object Case (-il)**: This suffix is used to mark the object of a verb. Examples include:
   - /xqo+mfotil/ ‘dog’
   - /héyul cAwil/ ‘dog’

2. **Possessive Case (-it+baq)**: This suffix indicates possession. Examples include:
   - /?uyitit+bag/ ‘his’
   - /matit+baq/ ‘his’

3. **Locative Case (-y, -w, -wa)**: These suffixes indicate location or direction. Examples include:
   - /cat+w/ ‘in the house’
   - /xatw/ ‘in the mouth’
   - /bton(wa)/ ‘after’
   - /lew/ ‘beside, along’

4. **Benefactive Case (-itib)**: This suffix indicates a benefactive relationship. Examples include:
   - /nayutitib/ ‘for the cat’
   - /toncititib/ ‘for the baby’

The grammar also mentions other suffixes that are used for specific functions, such as indicating alienable and inalienable possession, but these are not counted as separate cases under the given definition.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",6-7 cases,4 cases
Slave,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Slave focus extensively on the use of postpositions to express various semantic relationships such as location, direction, time, cause, purpose, and accompaniment. The detailed examples illustrate that these postpositions are used to mark relationships that in other languages might be marked by cases.

However, the key point here is that these are postpositions, not case markers. Postpositions are separate words that follow the noun they govern, whereas case markers are typically affixes attached directly to the noun. The extensive use of postpositions in Slave suggests that the language relies on these to convey relationships that might be handled by cases in other languages.

Given the extensive use of postpositions and the lack of evidence for a productive case paradigm of nouns (i.e., there are no examples of nouns being inflected for case), it is clear that Slave does not use morphological case-marking in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses postpositions to achieve similar functions.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Squamish, the language exhibits the following case-marking features:

1. **Absolutive Case**: This is the unmarked form and is used for the subject of intransitive verbs and both the subject and direct object of transitive verbs.
2. **Relative Case**: This is marked by the prefix /t-/ and is used for other relata, including secondary relata and the initiator of an action expressed by a passive verb.

The presence of these two distinct case forms (Absolutive and Relative) indicates that Squamish has a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Reasoning:
- **Absolutive Case**: This is explicitly mentioned as the case for the subject of intransitive verbs and the subject and direct object of transitive verbs.
- **Relative Case**: This is marked by the prefix /t-/ and is used for other grammatical relations, including secondary relata and the initiator of actions in passive constructions.

Given the information, Squamish has a clear distinction between two cases: Absolutive and Relative.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the noun inflection system described.

1. **Noun Inflection (4.81)**:
   - The determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
   - The definitive case requires the use of gender-number suffixes.
   - The non-definitive case uses no inflectional suffixes.
   - The locative case is expressed by one of three locative suffixes.

2. **Locative Suffixes (4.85)**:
   - There are three locative suffixes: -s, -stihki, and -hta, used to form the locative case.

3. **Syntactic Uses (10.11)**:
   - The uses of the three case categories (definitive, non-definitive, and locative) are described in detail, confirming their distinct syntactic roles.

### Conclusion:
Tunica has a productive case paradigm with three distinct cases: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative. Therefore, the number of cases in Tunica is:

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Washo, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses various prefixes and their syntactic expansions, focusing on subjective, objective, and imperative forms. However, it does not provide evidence of a productive case system for marking nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2** details pronoun inflection, including person, number, and inclusiveness. It mentions subjective and objective pronouns but does not describe a broader case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3** focuses on the derivation of adverbs with postpositions, indicating that nouns, pronouns, and quantitatives can take postpositional suffixes to express relationships such as instrumental, locative, comitative, and similative. These postpositions are more akin to adpositions in English rather than a productive case system.

4. **Paragraph 4** describes subordination of finite verbs and the formation of nominalized and adverbialized clauses. It mentions subjective and objective nominalizations but does not indicate a broader case system for nouns.

The evidence suggests that Washo uses postpositions to express certain relationships (e.g., locative, instrumental) rather than a productive case system for nouns. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is limited to concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wichita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wichita, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Instrumental Case**: The text mentions the instrumental suffix ""-thir"" used to express instruments or means, as seen in examples like ""ha:ritwitc&:nir"" (using a bowl) and ""ika:rfthir"" (with a rock).

2. **Locative Case**: The locative suffix ""-h"" is used to indicate location, as seen in examples like ""ikeatkfyah"" (where the rock is) and ""nshe:hfirih"" (where the creek is).

3. **Definite Article**: The suffix ""-re"" is mentioned as a definite article, which is not typically considered a case marker but rather a determiner.

4. **Combining Forms**: The text mentions combining forms of nouns, such as ""-s"" for animate nouns and ""-?a"" for inanimate nouns, which are used in compound forms but do not necessarily indicate case.

5. **Absence of Other Cases**: There is no mention of other productive case paradigms such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. The examples provided focus on locative and instrumental uses, with no indication of a broader case system.

6. **Borderline Case-Marking**: The presence of locative and instrumental suffixes suggests that Wichita has overt marking for specific semantic relations, but there is no evidence of a comprehensive case system covering core grammatical relations (like subject or object marking).

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wintu, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the productive case paradigms of nouns.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - The pronominal system in Wintu distinguishes six cases: subject, object, dependent possessive, independent possessive, instrumental, and locative.
   - These cases are marked by specific suffixes: {um} for object, {t} for possessive, {r} for instrumental, and {in} for locative.

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - The locative case is mentioned multiple times, marked by the suffix {in}.
   - The genitive case is also mentioned, marked by the suffix {un}.
   - The examples provided show the use of locative and genitive cases in noun phrases.

### Reasoning:

The information provided in the paragraphs indicates that Wintu has a productive case system for nouns, including at least the following cases:
- **Nominative (subject)**
- **Accusative (object)**
- **Genitive (possessive)**
- **Instrumental**
- **Locative**

This gives us a total of five distinct cases. The mention of both dependent and independent possessive cases suggests that possessive marking is complex, but it does not necessarily indicate more than one genitive case for the purposes of this classification.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",4 cases,5 cases

- Relative
- Locative
- Ablative

Therefore, Aleut has 4 cases.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),,no morphological case-marking,
Comanche,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Comanche, we can identify the following case markers:

1. **Absolutive Case**:
   - The absolutive suffixes include `-pi`, `-pih`, `-pth`, and variations thereof. These suffixes are used to mark the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.

2. **Objective Case**:
   - The objective case is marked by suffixes such as `-@`, `-?a`, `-ha`, `-i`, `-e`, and `-ta`. These suffixes are used to mark the direct object of verbs.

3. **Possessive Case**:
   - The possessive case is marked by suffixes such as `-ta`, `-Hta`, `-tina`, `-ha`, `-e`, `-@`, `-?a`, and `-na`. These suffixes indicate possession.

Kiowa,"To determine the number of cases in Kiowa, we need to look for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns in the provided paragraphs. Specifically, we are looking for morphological markers that indicate different grammatical relationships such as nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc.

### Analysis of Paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1:**
   - This paragraph discusses adjectival modifiers and pronouns, but it does not provide clear evidence of case marking on nouns. It mentions independent pronouns and some inflectional morphology related to number and person, but not case.

2. **Paragraph 2:**
   - This paragraph focuses on indefinite/interrogative words and their derivation. It does not mention case marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3:**
   - This paragraph discusses deictic adverbials and locative expressions. It mentions locative suffixes and directional markers, which are often related to spatial relations rather than grammatical case. However, it does not provide evidence of a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 4:**
   - This paragraph discusses noun-locatives and instrumental suffixes. It mentions locative/directional adverbials and instrumental markers (e.g., ""with a fork""), which are concrete or peripheral case relations. These markers are more indicative of locative and instrumental cases rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.) on nouns. Instead, the evidence points to the presence of locative and instrumental markers, which are concrete or peripheral case relations. Therefore, Kiowa seems to have overt marking only for these specific relations.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Absolutive Case**: This is the basic form used for subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. It is also used as the citation form of nouns.
2. **Ablative-Modalis Case**: This case is used for indefinite objects, places from which motion occurs, and specification. It is marked by the suffix ~%mek in the singular and ~%nek in the plural.
3. **Terminalis Case**: This case indicates the place to which motion occurs and is marked by ~%mun in the singular and ~%nun in the plural.
4. **Localis Case**: This case indicates the place at which something occurs and is marked by ~%mi in the singular and ~%ni in the plural.
5. **Vialis Case**: This case indicates the route or means by which something occurs and is marked by %kun in the singular and %tgun in the plural.
6. **Equalis Case**: This case indicates similarity or comparison and is marked by %tun in the singular and %cetun in the plural.
7. **Relative Case**: This case is used for possessors and subjects of transitive verbs. It is marked by %:(e)m in the singular, %:(e)t in the plural, and %:(e)k in the dual.

From the above, we can see that Yup'ik has at least seven distinct cases: Absolutive, Ablative-Modalis, Terminalis, Localis, Vialis, Equalis, and Relative. 

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Personal Pronouns (11.21)**:
   - There are distinct forms for subjects and objects in the first and second person singular (e.g., ""nek"" for ""I"" and ""nekac"" for ""me"").
   - There are also comitative forms (e.g., ""neka?ai"" for ""with me"").
   - Locative forms are mentioned (e.g., ""neka‘noi"" for ""with us"").

2. **Nouns (11.3)**:
   - Nouns are generally invariable, with some exceptions for plural forms.
   - Locative forms are created by adding specific suffixes to the noun (e.g., ""cpega?r"" becomes ""cpega?rot"" for ""in the ear"").
   - There are irregular locative forms and other locative inflections (e.g., ""ho:let"" becomes ""ho-letik"" for ""in the garden"").

From this information, we can infer the following:
- The language has specific forms for subjects and objects in personal pronouns, indicating at least a nominative-accusative distinction.
- There are comitative and locative forms, which are typically considered peripheral or semantic cases.

Given the presence of these forms, Yurok does not have a rich case system with numerous syntactic cases but does have overt marking for locative and comitative relations.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of distinct subject and object forms in personal pronouns suggests some level of case marking.
- The existence of locative and comitative forms indicates marking for peripheral relations.
- The general invariable nature of nouns, except for locative forms, suggests that case marking is not extensive.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the Zuni grammar, we can make the following observations:

1. **Personal Pronouns**: The grammar describes personal pronouns differentiated for number (singular, dual, plural) and for case (subject, object, possessive). This indicates that Zuni has at least three distinct cases for pronouns.

2. **Noun Compounds and Suffixation**: The discussion on noun compounds and suffixation does not explicitly mention any additional case markers for nouns beyond the possessive, subject, and object cases already noted for pronouns.

3. **Enclitics**: The enclitics described (e.g., locative enclitic -an, directional enclitic -kwin) suggest that there are specific markers for locative and directional relations, which could be considered as additional cases if they are productive and systematically applied to nouns.

Given these points, Zuni appears to have a system that includes at least the nominative (subject), accusative (object), possessive, locative, and directional cases. This suggests a minimum of five cases, assuming these enclitics are productive and systematically applied to nouns.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of subject, object, and possessive cases for pronouns.
- The presence of locative and directional enclitics that function similarly to cases in marking nouns for specific relations.

**Conclusion**: 5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin), we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Oblique Marking**: The language uses an oblique marker ""t"" for noun phrases that do not have direct argument status in the clause. This marker is used for various roles such as instruments, themes, and factitives, as well as for ergative arguments in certain constructions (e.g., antipassive and applicative constructions).

2. **Locative Prepositions**: There is a set of locative prepositions (k’] ‘to, into’, | ‘in, at, on’, tl’ ‘from’, tu ‘from’) used to mark adjunct arguments of location. These prepositions indicate spatial relations and are not considered core grammatical cases but rather peripheral or semantic cases.

3. **Genitive Marking**: The genitive marker ""J"" is used to indicate possession. This marker can appear in various positions relative to the possessor and possessum, and its use is optional.

From this information, we can infer that Columbia-Wenatchi does not have a rich system of core grammatical cases (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.) but instead relies on markers for oblique and locative relations, as well as a genitive marker for possession. These markers are more indicative of peripheral or semantic case relations rather than a full-fledged case system.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of an oblique marker ""t"" and locative prepositions suggests that the language marks certain peripheral relations.
- The genitive marker ""J"" is used for possession but does not indicate a broader system of core grammatical cases.
- There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for core grammatical functions (e.g., subject, object) beyond these peripheral markers.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tlingit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tlingit, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Nominal Phrase Functions**:
   - The nominal phrase can function as subject, object, indirect object, and extension.
   - There are formal contrasts between these functions, but they are primarily marked by agreement with pronominal prefixes in the verb rather than by distinct case markers on the nouns themselves.

2. **Syntactic Markers**:
   - There are several syntactic markers (e.g., -j for subject, -3 for instrumental) that follow the nominal phrases, but these are more syntactic markers rather than morphological case markers.
   - The presence of markers like -j and -3 suggests some level of marking for specific syntactic roles, but these do not form a comprehensive case system for all noun functions.

3. **Locative and Adverbial Phrases**:
   - Locative and adverbial phrases are marked by situational syntactic markers (e.g., -d, -de, -x), indicating specific locative or instrumental roles.
   - These markers are more indicative of peripheral or semantic cases rather than a full-fledged morphological case system.

4. **Agreement Patterns**:
   - Agreement in Tlingit is primarily handled through pronominal prefixes in the verb, which agree with the subject or object, rather than through distinct case endings on the nouns.

5. **Examples and Usage**:
   - The examples provided show that the marking of roles like subject, object, and indirect object is done through verb agreement and syntactic markers rather than through a productive case paradigm on the nouns themselves.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The language Tlingit does not exhibit a full-fledged morphological case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns. Instead, it uses pronominal agreement and a limited set of syntactic markers for specific roles like locative and instrumental, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Animate and Inanimate Distinctions**:
   - The language makes a clear distinction between animate and inanimate nouns, which affects verb agreement and plural forms. However, this distinction is not directly related to case marking but rather to noun classification and verb agreement.

2. **Obviation**:
   - Passamaquoddy-Maliseet uses obviation to mark distinctions between proximate and obviative third persons. This system is used to indicate the focus of attention and is marked on both nouns and verbs. The obviative is sometimes referred to as the ""fourth person."" This marking is a type of case marking, specifically for distinguishing between different third-person referents.

3. **Possession**:
   - The language has specific forms for possessed nouns, which include additional marking for the obviative in third-person forms. This indicates a possessive relationship but does not constitute a full case system as seen in languages with nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

4. **Locative Inflection**:
   - Locative endings are used to indicate location, which is a type of case marking. The locative forms are productive and can be added to any noun.

5. **Absentative Inflection**:
   - There are absentative forms that indicate the absence of the noun in time or space. This is another type of case marking but is more specialized.

6. **Vocative Inflection**:
   - Some nouns have vocative forms used for direct address. This is a pragmatic function and not typically counted as a grammatical case.

### Conclusion:

The primary productive case paradigms in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet are the obviative and locative. The obviative marks distinctions in third-person referents, while the locative marks spatial relations. The absentative and vocative forms, while interesting, do not constitute additional grammatical cases in the traditional sense.

Given the presence of these specific case markers, the language does not have a full-fledged case system with multiple syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it has specialized case markings for specific functions.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tsimshian (Coast), the language exhibits a clear system of case marking. The key points are:

1. **Ergative-Absolutive Alignment**: The language distinguishes between ergative and absolutive cases. Ergative case marks the subject of transitive verbs, while absolutive case marks the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.

2. **Case Marking**: There are specific morphological markers for ergative and absolutive cases. For instance, the enclitic -a/null attaches to the verb when followed by an absolutive, and -t attaches to the temporal designation when followed by an ergative.

3. **Pronominal Forms**: The language also has pronominal forms that align with the ergative and absolutive cases, further indicating a productive case system.

4. **Marked and Unmarked Forms**: There are marked and unmarked forms for both ergative and absolutive pronominals, showing a nuanced system of case marking.

Given these observations, Tsimshian (Coast) has a productive case paradigm with at least two distinct cases: ergative and absolutive.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tetelcingo Nahuatl, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system as follows:

1. **Absolutive Case**: The language uses an absolutive suffix (-tl, -t, -ti) which is dropped in various morphological contexts such as possession, pluralization, compounding, and when a postposition is added. This indicates a productive case paradigm for marking the absolutive case.

2. **Possession**: Possession is indicated by prefixes (e.g., no- for ""my"", i- for ""his/her/its""), which do not constitute a separate case but rather a possessive construction.

3. **Postpositions**: The language employs postpositions (e.g., -pa for ""on"", -ka for ""with"", -tla for ""near"") which are bound to the noun and indicate locative and instrumental relations. These postpositions do not form a productive case paradigm but rather function as adpositions.

4. **Pluralization**: Plural forms are marked by suffixes (-me, -te), which again do not constitute a separate case but rather a number marking.

From the analysis, it is evident that Tetelcingo Nahuatl does not have a productive case system beyond the absolutive case. The use of postpositions for locative and instrumental relations suggests that these are not integrated into a case paradigm but function separately as adpositions.

**Reasoning**:
- The absolutive case is the only productive case paradigm observed.
- Possession is marked by prefixes, not by a genitive case.
- Locative and instrumental relations are marked by postpositions, not by cases.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abkhaz,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abkhaz do not indicate the presence of a productive case system for nouns. Instead, they describe a system where syntactic functions and relationships are marked by pronominal affixes within the verbal complex, as well as possessive prefixes on nouns. This suggests that Abkhaz relies on a combination of verbal morphology and possessive constructions rather than a traditional case-marking system for nouns.

1. **Absence of Case-Marking**: The text explicitly mentions the absence of case-marking for nouns, indicating that syntactic roles are marked by pronominal affixes and possessive prefixes rather than by case endings on the nouns themselves.
2. **Pronominal Affixes**: The description of pronominal affixes correlating with subjects of intransitive verbs, direct objects of transitive verbs, and indirect objects further supports the lack of a case system. These affixes are used to indicate grammatical relationships that would typically be marked by cases in other languages.
3. **Possessive Prefixes**: The use of possessive prefixes on nouns to indicate possession also suggests an alternative strategy to case-marking for expressing relationships between nouns.
4. **Reflexive and Reciprocal Constructions**: The description of reflexive and reciprocal constructions within the verbal complex, rather than through nominal case-marking, further indicates that Abkhaz does not utilize a productive case system for nouns.

Given this information, the most appropriate conclusion is that Abkhaz has **no morphological case-marking** for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Eastern Armenian, the following cases are identified:

1. **Nominative (NOM)**: This is the unmarked case, used for subjects, direct objects denoting non-persons, adverbial modifiers of location and time, complements of the copula, and vocatives.

2. **Dative (DAT)**: This case has multiple functions, including possessive, subjective, objective, origin, part of a whole, direct object denoting a person, complement of addressee or beneficient, adverbial modifier of location and time.

3. **Ablative (ABL)**: This case is used for complements of verbs of negative emotion, removal, partitive objects, agent’s complement in passive constructions, basis of comparison, adverbial modifiers of cause, location (point of departure), and time (moment of beginning).

4. **Instrumental (INST)**: This case is used for complements of verbs of contact, filling, occupation, instrument, concommitant object, agent’s complement in passive constructions, adverbial modifiers of manner, route, time, and cause. It can also function as a premodifier qualifying a thing or a person by its integral part.

5. **Locative (LOC)**: This case is used for the second valency of verbs of residence and as an adverbial modifier of place and location in time.

The grammar clearly outlines five distinct productive case paradigms for nouns: Nominative, Dative, Ablative, Instrumental, and Locative.

Basque,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the inflectional paradigms given for the nouns ""leku"" (place) and ""hondartza"" (beach). 

The inflectional paradigms for these nouns include the following forms:

1. Absolutive (ABS)
2. Ergative (ERG)
3. Dative (DAT)
4. Genitive (GEN)
5. Benefactive (BEN)
6. Comitative (COM)
7. Instrumental (INSTR)
8. Partitive (PRTT)
9. Prolative (PRO)
10. Locative (LOC)
11. Ablative (ABL)
12. Allative (ALL)
13. Directive (DIR)
14. Terminative (TERM)
15. Relative (REL)

These forms indicate that Basque has a rich system of case marking, with at least 15 distinct cases being used productively in the language. 

### Reasoning:
The paradigms provided show a comprehensive set of case markers that cover a wide range of grammatical and semantic functions. The presence of multiple locative cases (LOC, ABL, ALL) and other specific cases like the Benefactive (BEN) and Comitative (COM) further supports the conclusion that Basque has a highly developed case system.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Catalan, we can analyze the presence and use of personal pronouns, including their forms and functions. Here are the key points relevant to determining the number of cases in Catalan:

1. **Personal Pronouns and Their Forms**:
   - Catalan personal pronouns are categorized by person, number, and sometimes gender.
   - The pronouns include subject forms (e.g., jo, tu, ell, ella, nosaltres, vosaltres, ells, elles) and prepositional object forms (e.g., mi, tu, ell, ella, nosaltres, vosaltres, ells, elles).
   - Reflexive pronouns like ""si"" are used in specific contexts.

2. **Usage of Pronouns**:
   - Subject pronouns are often omitted unless needed for emphasis or clarification.
   - Prepositional object pronouns are used after prepositions, with some special forms like ""mi"" for the first-person singular and ""si"" for reflexive third-person.

3. **Inflection and Agreement**:
   - Third-person pronouns show gender and number agreement (e.g., ell/ella, ells/elles).
   - Other pronouns do not vary for gender and rely on lexical differences for number (e.g., tu vs. vosaltres).

4. **Syntax and Pragmatics**:
   - Pronouns can appear in various syntactic positions, including as subjects and objects of prepositions.
   - Reflexive and reciprocal uses of pronouns are noted, with ""si"" used reflexively and sometimes replaced by non-reflexive forms for clarity.

From this analysis, it is evident that Catalan does not employ a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and pronouns to indicate grammatical relationships. The forms of pronouns change based on their syntactic role (subject, object of preposition), but this does not constitute a full-fledged case system as seen in languages with nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Frisian (Western) descriptive grammar, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language.

1. **Pronouns and Case Distinctions**:
   - The pronouns section (4.1.4) indicates that Frisian has distinct forms for subject (nominative) and object (accusative) pronouns. For example, ""ik"" (I) vs. ""my"" (me), ""do"" (you) vs. ""dy"" (you), ""hy"" (he) vs. ""him"" (him), etc.
   - There is also mention of possessive forms such as ""jins"" (yours), which can be considered a genitive case.

2. **Indefinite Pronouns**:
   - The indefinite pronouns section (4.1.4.3) shows the use of ""men"" (one) with its objective form ""jin"" and possessive form ""jins"". This further supports the presence of nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.

3. **Reflexive Pronouns**:
   - Reflexive pronouns use the object forms of personal pronouns, indicating that the object form (accusative) is used in reflexive constructions.

4. **Relative Pronouns**:
   - The relative pronouns section (4.1.4.6) does not introduce any new case forms but uses the same nominative and accusative forms.

5. **General Observations**:
   - The grammar does not mention any additional cases beyond nominative, accusative, and genitive. There is no evidence of dative, locative, instrumental, or other peripheral cases.
   - The case system appears to be limited to these three primary cases, and there is no indication of a more extensive case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Frisian (Western) has a productive case system with three cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Hunzib,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Hunzib, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Nominative**: The nominative case is used to mark the subject of a sentence. For example, ""oze"" (boy) in ""oze iyaa"" (the boy cries).

2. **Ergative**: The ergative case marks the agent of a transitive verb. For example, ""oze-di-l"" (boy-ERG) in ""oze-di-l m-uq"" (the boy eats an apple).

3. **Genitive**: The genitive case indicates possession. For example, ""oze-di-s"" (boy-GEN) in ""oze-di-s xabér"" (the boy's story).

4. **Dative**: The dative case marks the indirect object or the recipient. For example, ""oze-di-i"" (boy-DAT) in ""oze-di-i kid"" (to the boy).

5. **Instrumental**: The instrumental case indicates the means by which an action is performed. For example, ""oze-di-d"" (boy-INS) in ""oze-di-d xank’al"" (the boy with khinkal).

6. **Adessive**: The adessive case indicates location at or near something. For example, ""oze-di-g"" (boy-AD) in ""oze-di-g wa"" (near the boy).

7. **Superessive**: The superessive case indicates location on top of something. For example, ""oze-di-X"" (boy-SUP) in ""oze-di-X wa"" (on the boy).

8. **Subessive**: The subessive case indicates location under something. For example, ""oze-di-k"" (boy-SUB) in ""oze-di-k wa"" (under the boy).

9. **Comitative**: The comitative case indicates accompaniment. For example, ""oze-di-gur"" (boy-COM) in ""oze-di-gur wa"" (with the boy).

10. **Allative**: The allative case indicates movement towards something. For example, ""oze-di-dar"" (boy-ALL) in ""oze-di-dar wa"" (towards the boy).

11. **Elative**: The elative case indicates movement out of something. For example, ""oze-di-sa"" (boy-ELA) in ""oze-di-sa wa"" (out of the boy).

12. **Translative**: The translative case indicates change or transformation. For example, ""oze-di-Xi"" (boy-TRANS) in ""oze-di-Xi wa"" (into the boy).

13. **Approximative**: The approximative case indicates proximity. For example, ""oze-di-do"" (boy-APPR) in ""oze-di-do wa"" (near the boy).

Given the extensive list of cases identified in the grammar, Hunzib clearly has a rich and productive case system.

### Conclusion:

Kayah Li (Eastern),,no morphological case-marking,
Khanty,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Khanty, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The case system includes the unmarked Nominative, the Locative in -na, and the Translative with affixes -ji after a vowel and -Ci after a consonant-final stem.
   - The Locative case is used for various functions such as indicating place, direction, passive agent, patient argument in certain constructions, point in time, measure, instrument or means, distributive, and indirect object of some verbs.
   - The Translative case is used for secondary predicates, result or final point of movement, verbal action, and main predicate with the copula ji- ‘become’.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Personal pronouns inflect for case, but their case paradigm differs from that of nouns. They include the morphologically unmarked Nominative, the Accusative-Dative, and the Locative.
   - The Locative of personal pronouns is formed from the Accusative-Dative with the affix -na.
   - Postpositions can take agreement affixes identical to the personal affixes of nouns, indicating a relationship to nominal inflection.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Khanty has a productive case system with the following cases: Nominative, Locative, and Translative. This totals to **3 cases**.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",3 cases,3 cases
Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can analyze the case system of the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 9.5** outlines the various grammatical cases in Korean. It mentions the following cases:
   - Nominative
   - Accusative
   - Dative
   - Static Locative
   - Dynamic Locative
   - Source
   - Goal
   - Instrument
   - Directional
   - Genitive
   - Comitative

3. **Semantic Cases**:
   - Dative, Goal, Locative (Static and Dynamic), Source, Directional, Instrument, and Function are identified as semantic cases. These mainly express the semantic functions of nominals.

4. **Case Particles**:
   - Case particles are used to mark these cases, and they can often be omitted in various discourse contexts.

5. **Case Particle Stacking**:
   - Korean allows for case-particle stacking, where multiple case particles can occur in sequence, reflecting the agglutinative nature of the language.

6. **Vocative**:
   - The vocative case is used to draw the attention of the addressee in a discourse context.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, Korean has a rich and productive case system that includes both syntactic and semantic cases. The language exhibits more than 10 distinct cases, including nominative, accusative, dative, various locatives, source, goal, instrumental, directional, genitive, comitative, connective, and vocative.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Latvian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided descriptive grammar of Latvian, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms for nouns. Here is the relevant information extracted from the text:

1. **Traditional Cases**: The traditional grammars of Latvian have worked with a system of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative.

2. **Instrumental Case**: The status of the instrumental case is questioned because it is identical in form with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural. It occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" (with). The grammar concludes that in modern Latvian, there is no separate instrumental case, and the preposition ""ar"" governs the accusative.

3. **Final Case System**: The grammar agrees with other sources that deny the existence of a separate instrumental case in modern Latvian, resulting in a system consisting of six cases.

4. **Case Descriptions**: The grammar provides detailed paradigms and usage for the six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and vocative. The instrumental is mentioned only in historical and adverbialized contexts, not as a productive case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Latvian has a productive case system consisting of six cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",5 cases,6-7 cases
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Tati (Southern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Tati, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **General Remarks (Paragraph 1)**:
   - Eshtehardi, a Southern Tati dialect, has a clear system of two cases: direct and oblique.
   - Other dialects in the Southern Tati group also show a distinction between direct and oblique cases, though the extent varies.
   - The oblique case is marked by -(a)r for certain nouns and is used for genitives and direct objects denoting a person.
   - Postpositions create case-like forms but are not considered true case endings.

2. **Inflection of Nouns (Paragraph 1)**:
   - The singular direct case for masculine nouns is uninflected, while the oblique case adds an unstressed -e.
   - Feminine nouns in the oblique case generally retain the same form as the direct case, except in Eshtehardi where they have a stressed -a.
   - The plural forms also distinguish between direct and oblique cases, with specific endings for each.

3. **Use of the Nominal Cases (Paragraph 3)**:
   - The direct case is used for subjects, vocatives, agents in most dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions.
   - The oblique case is used for genitives, agents in some dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions.

4. **Postpositions (Paragraph 4)**:
   - Postpositions are frequently used and can create forms that resemble case endings, but they are not true case markers.

5. **Personal Pronouns (Paragraph 5)**:
   - The oblique forms of personal pronouns are used for genitives, direct and indirect objects, and agents in passive constructions in Eshtehardi.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, Southern Tati has a productive case system with two cases: direct and oblique. The presence of these two cases is consistent across various dialects, although the exact usage and forms may vary slightly.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Turkish,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkish, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative (Absolute)**: Used for subjects.
2. **Accusative (Objective)**: Used for direct objects.
3. **Dative**: Used for indirect objects, benefactives, and directional arguments with the semantic function of goal.
4. **Locative**: Used for locational arguments.
5. **Ablative**: Used for directional arguments with the semantic function of source, object of comparison, or partitive semantics.
6. **Genitive**: Used for subjects of nominalized clauses and for expressing the function of a noun phrase as possessor in possessive noun phrases.

The suffixes for these cases are:
- Nominative: -039 (zero suffix)
- Accusative: -(y)I
- Dative: -(y)A
- Locative: -DA
- Ablative: -DAn
- Genitive: -(n)In

Additionally, the text mentions the instrumental/comitative clitic -(y)lA, but it is not considered a genuine case marker by traditional grammarians due to its clitic nature and the existence of a free counterpart (ile).

### Conclusion:
**6-7 cases**

Turkish has six productive cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, and genitive. The instrumental/comitative marker is not counted as a genuine case marker, thus not increasing the count beyond six.",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, the language exhibits a robust and productive case system. The paragraphs explicitly list and describe the functions of the following cases:

The grammar explicitly mentions that Udmurt has 15 cases, which include a mix of local (spatial) and grammatical cases. The local cases are specifically noted to be seven in number, and the remaining eight are more general grammatical cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Urdu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urdu, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Nominative Case**: The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. It is explicitly mentioned and exemplified in the text.
   
2. **Oblique Case**: The oblique case is used when a noun is followed by a postposition. This includes various grammatical functions such as marking possession, objects, and subjects in certain constructions. The oblique case is also used with postpositions to indicate relationships like location, direction, and time.

3. **Vocative Case**: The vocative case is used for directly addressing someone or something. It is mentioned that the vocative singular suffix is identical to the oblique suffix, and the vocative plural suffix is also provided.

The grammar explicitly mentions these three cases (nominative, oblique, and vocative) and provides examples and rules for their usage. There is no mention of additional productive case paradigms for nouns beyond these three.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can identify several productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is a summary of the cases mentioned:

1. **Predicative Case**: This is used for nominal predicates and focuses within clauses. It has specific markers (-lek and -(e)k) and is incompatible with possessive noun phrases, proper names, and third-person pronouns.

2. **Ablative Case**: This case is used to indicate movement away from a location or person, temporal meanings, the scope of an action, the location of a primary participant, metaphorical functions (such as cause, source of information, group participation, and comparison of inequality).

3. **Prolative Case**: This case signifies movement along or within locations, and can denote routes, spatial domains, or holes through which something moves. It can also indicate the way information is transmitted, the reason for an event, or the part of the object directly acted upon.

4. **Attributive Form**: Although not a case in the traditional sense, it is used to express properties of the head-noun referent and is non-referential.

5. **Possessive Attributive Form**: This form marks possessive relations between the referent of a nominal modifier and a possessor outside the noun phrase.

6. **Privative Form**: This form indicates the absence of something ('without X').

7. **Temporal Form**: This form is used with nouns denoting seasons or periods of time to create adverb-like temporal expressions.

8. **Prospective Form**: This form indicates something that is going to be or is intended to be.

9. **Proprietive Form**: This form indicates possession or existence and behaves like a noun internally but like a verb externally.

10. **Stative Form**: This form indicates a transient state of a person and is used with borrowed adjectives to integrate them into the Yukaghir system.

11. **Transformative Form**: This form indicates a change into a state or function and is used with verbs like 'to become'.

From this analysis, it is clear that Yukaghir (Kolyma) has a rich system of case marking, including several productive cases that go beyond the basic nominative, accusative, and genitive cases found in many languages. The presence of cases like the Predicative, Ablative, Prolative, and others indicates a complex system of morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
**10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Apurinã,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text describes various morphological markers such as emphasis, gerund, affectedness, and perfectivity, but these do not constitute grammatical cases as defined in the context of syntactic functions like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The examples given in the text show morphological markers that attach to noun bases, pronoun bases, and verb bases, but these markers (e.g., -putu for emphasis, -inhi for gerund, -nhi for affectedness, and -pe for perfectivity) do not indicate syntactic roles or grammatical relations typically associated with case systems.
   - The markers described are more related to semantic or aspectual modifications rather than indicating grammatical relations between nouns and verbs.
   - There is no mention of markers that would correspond to traditional cases like nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awa Pit indicate the following:

1. **Nominative-Accusative System**: Awa Pit has a nominative-accusative case-marking system. The subject of a sentence is unmarked, while the object may be marked, particularly if it is a referential human noun phrase. This is evident from the use of the accusative marker ""ta"" for referential human objects.

2. **Accusative Marking**: The accusative case is marked by ""ta"" for referential human noun phrases. Non-referential or non-human noun phrases in the object position are generally unmarked. There are also instances where locative postpositions like ""mal"" or ""pa"" are used in specific contexts, but these are exceptions rather than the rule.

3. **Personal Pronouns**: The singular personal pronouns have specific accusative suffixes (e.g., ""wa"" for first and second person, ""a"" for third person). Plural personal pronouns use accusative clitics that attach to the final element of an object noun phrase.

4. **Locative and Allative Marking**: The postposition ""ta"" is also used as a locative marker indicating position in a container or a specific location. This dual function of ""ta"" as both an accusative and a locative marker is noted, but it does not introduce additional cases beyond nominative and accusative.

5. **Possessive Constructions**: Possession is indicated using the postposition ""pa"" or possessive adjectives. This does not constitute a separate case but rather a possessive construction.

6. **Relational Nouns and Other Postpositions**: The language uses relational nouns and various postpositions to indicate complex locational ideas, instruments, comitatives, reasons, and semblatives. These are not considered additional grammatical cases but rather specific constructions or postpositional phrases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Awa Pit has a nominative-accusative case system with specific marking for accusative case in referential human noun phrases. There is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms for nouns beyond nominative and accusative. Therefore, the number of cases in Awa Pit is best described as:

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",10 or more cases,2 cases
Barasano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barasano, we can analyze the case system as follows:

1. **Object Marker (-re)**: The suffix -re is used to mark definite objects, experiencers, and benefactees. It is also used to mark manner. This indicates that -re serves multiple syntactic roles, primarily focusing on the object of a verb when it is definite.

2. **Accompaniment and Instrument Marker (réka)**: The suffix réka is used to mark accompaniment and instruments, indicating a distinct case for these roles.

3. **Location and Time Marker (-h#)**: The suffix -h# is used to mark locations and times, which suggests a locative case.

4. **Genitive Marker (ya)**: The suffix ya is used to mark genitive relationships, indicating possession.

From this information, we can identify four productive case paradigms in Barasano:

- **Accusative (Object)**: Marked by -re.
- **Instrumental/Comitative**: Marked by réka.
- **Locative/Temporal**: Marked by -h#.
- **Genitive**: Marked by ya.

These markers are used productively to indicate specific grammatical relationships between nouns and verbs or other nouns.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of distinct markers for objects, instruments, locations, and possession indicates a productive case system.
- The markers are used consistently and systematically to indicate these grammatical roles.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Epena Pedee,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Epena Pedee, we can determine the number of cases in the language by identifying the productive case paradigms of nouns.

### Reasoning:

1. **Ergative Case**:
   - The ergative case is marked by the suffixes `-pa` for most noun phrases and `-a` for most pronouns. This case marks the subject of transitive clauses.
   - Examples: 
     - (23) `usd-pa` (dog-ERG)
     - (263) `mi-a` (I-ERG)

2. **Absolutive Case**:
   - The absolutive case is not marked overtly. It is used for the object of transitive clauses and the subject of intransitive clauses.
   - Examples:
     - (24) `tdi-@` (we-ABS)
     - (267) `iméma` (tiger)

3. **Dative Case**:
   - The dative case is marked by `-mda`, `-md-a`, `-a`, or by vowel lengthening and stress. It indicates the recipient or goal of an action.
   - Examples:
     - (268) `nawe-ma-a` (mother-LOC-DAT)
     - (270) `juancité-o` (Juancito-DAT)

4. **Instrumental Case**:
   - The instrumental case is marked by `-pa` (with vowel lengthening of the preceding vowel). It indicates the means or instrument by which an action is performed.
   - Example:
     - (264) `nek""6-pa` (machete-INST)

5. **Locative Case**:
   - The locative case is marked by `-de`, `-da`, `-ma`, or `-mai`. It indicates the location where an action takes place.
   - Examples:
     - (292) `hapa-de` (canoe-LOC)
     - (293) `tée-da` (house-LOC)

6. **Ablative Case**:
   - The ablative case is marked by `-pa` (with vowel lengthening of the preceding vowel) or `-péma`. It indicates movement from a source or origin.
   - Examples:
     - (318) `uria-dée-pa` (house hole-LOC-from)
     - (328) `pak'uru-de-péma` (tree-LOC-ORIG)

7. **Comparative Case**:
   - The comparative case is marked by `-ra`. It indicates comparison, intensified plurals, and switches of focus.
   - Examples:
     - (340) `tawarda-ra` (large-CMPR)
     - (346) `yerré-ra` (monkey-many*CMPR)

### Conclusion:
Epena Pedee has 6-7 cases. This includes ergative, absolutive, dative, instrumental, locative, ablative, and comparative cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Hixkaryana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hixkaryana, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1 Analysis:**
   - The text discusses various particles and suffixes used in Hixkaryana, such as ""komo"" (collective), ""tho"" (devalued), ""txko"" (diminutive), and ""ymo"" (augmentative). These particles modify nouns but do not indicate grammatical cases.
   - The paragraph also mentions the use of postpositional relators to express a wide range of syntactic and semantic functions, including locatives, manner, comparison, instrumental, agentive, comitative, benefactive, source, and time. This suggests that Hixkaryana relies on postpositions rather than case inflections to mark relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
   - The basic word order (object-verb-subject) and the use of person-marking prefixes in verbs to disambiguate subject and object roles further indicate that syntactic roles are not marked by noun inflections.

2. **Paragraph 2 Analysis:**
   - This paragraph continues to describe the use of postpositions for expressing temporal relationships (e.g., ""after Monday,"" ""before Monday"") and mentions the absence of a regular number-marking system for nouns.
   - The discussion of collective markers like ""komo"" and ""-yamo"" and their agreement with verbs reinforces the idea that Hixkaryana uses particles and suffixes for specific semantic functions rather than grammatical cases.
   - The paragraph also describes the use of personal pronouns with distinctions based on animacy, collectivity, and deixis, but does not mention any case inflections for these pronouns.

**Reasoning:**
- The descriptive grammar indicates that Hixkaryana uses postpositions to express syntactic and semantic relationships rather than inflectional case markers on nouns.
- The language employs various particles and suffixes for specific semantic modifications (e.g., collective, diminutive, augmentative) but does not have a productive case paradigm for marking grammatical relationships like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
- The reliance on word order and person-marking prefixes in verbs to indicate syntactic roles further supports the absence of morphological case marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Paumarí,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, we can identify several productive case paradigms for nouns. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Ergative Case (-a 'ERG')**: This case marks the subject of a transitive verb when it occurs immediately before the verb and is not associated with a demonstrative (e.g., ""mamai-a"" in example 351).

2. **Accusative Case (-ra 'OBJ')**: This case marks the direct object of a transitive verb when it occurs immediately before the verb and is not associated with a demonstrative (e.g., ""kahami-ra"" in example 353).

3. **Demoted Object Case (-a 'DEMOT:O')**: This case marks a demoted object, which is typically the patient in a ditransitive clause (e.g., ""ihai-a"" in example 358).

4. **Oblique Case (-a 'OBL')**: This case marks various oblique relations, including locative, temporal, instrumental, and adjunct phrases (e.g., ""kaasi-a"" in example 359 for locative, ""mahi-a"" in example 360 for temporal).

These cases are productive and systematically mark different grammatical relations in the language. Therefore, Paumarí has a clear and productive case-marking system for at least four distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",3 cases,4 cases
Pirahã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pirahã, we can identify the following key points regarding case marking:

1. **Oblique Case Marking**:
   - The suffix **-o** is used to mark locative or general oblique cases. This is evident in multiple examples such as ""ti kaio"" (I house-LOC) meaning ""I return home"" and ""xopisi xahoigi-o"" (Xopisi afternoon-LOC) meaning ""Xopisi will return in the afternoon"".
   - The suffix **-hio** and **-oa** are used for instrumental cases, as seen in examples like ""kahaixioi-hio"" (knife-INST) meaning ""with a knife"" and ""tagasag-oa"" (machete-INST) meaning ""with machetes"".

2. **Lack of Core Grammatical Case Marking**:
   - There is no mention of nominative, accusative, or dative case markers. The principal marker of grammatical relations is word order, as explicitly stated in the text: ""the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order.""
   - Subordinate clauses and other syntactic structures rely on word order rather than morphological case marking to indicate grammatical relations.

3. **Peripheral and Instrumental Case Marking**:
   - The language has productive morphological markers for peripheral cases, specifically locative and instrumental, which are used consistently in various contexts.

Given these observations, Pirahã does not have a comprehensive system of morphological case marking for core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative, or dative). Instead, it employs specific markers for peripheral cases like locative and instrumental.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Sanuma,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sanuma, we can identify the following productive case paradigms:

1. **Instrumental Case (-nd)**: This case is used to mark instruments or means by which an action is performed. Examples include:
   - ""kusiali te -nd sa ia"" (with a spoon)
   - ""motolo hamé ko -nd"" (by motorboat)

2. **Agentive Case (-nd)**: This case marks the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses, functioning as an ergative marker. Examples include:
   - ""kamisamak6 -n6"" (we will hit)
   - ""tépd6 -n6d"" (the children are looking at the pictures)

3. **Locative Case (ha/niha/nihamé/hamé)**: These markers indicate location, goal, or source. Examples include:
   - ""waika tépé_ sai po ha"" (to the Waika village)
   - ""ipa hao -nd hama te niha"" (give beads to the visitor)

4. **Noninstigational Agent (niha)**: This case marks a noninstigational agent, often used in causative constructions. Examples include:
   - ""Omaw6 tépd6 niha"" (the Omawé6 had their son drink the water)

5. **Comitative Case (kai)**: This case marks a subordinate participant in a leader-follower relationship. Examples include:
   - ""hise napd6 pd -né_ sa kai"" (the Carib leave, taking me along)

6. **Possessive Case (ipa/au)**: Although not explicitly marked as a case, possessive pronouns function similarly to genitive cases in other languages. Examples include:
   - ""ipa sai"" (my house)
   - ""au"" (your)

Given these observations, Sanuma exhibits a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: Instrumental, Agentive, Locative, Noninstigational Agent, Comitative, and Possessive.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",2 cases,6-7 cases
Shipibo-Konibo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Shipibo-Konibo, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Ergative-Absolutive Case-Marking**:
   - The language exhibits an ergative-absolutive case-marking system, where the ergative case is marked overtly, and the absolutive case is marked by zero. This is evident from the examples provided, such as:
     - ""Ja-n-ra ea-0 jamá-ke."" (3-ER-AS 1-AB kick-INC) - ""(S)he kicked me.""
     - ""E-n-ra ja-0 jamá-ke."" (1-ER-AS 3-AB kick-CMPL) - ""I kicked him/her/it.""

2. **Ergative Case**:
   - The ergative case is marked by the morpheme {-n} with various allomorphs depending on the phonological context. This morpheme also marks the genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal functions.

3. **Genitive Case**:
   - The genitive case is marked by the same morpheme as the ergative, as seen in examples like:
     - ""Cesar-nin-ra Maria-nin wai-0 rera-ke machito-nin."" (Cesar-ER-AS Maria-GEN field-AB cut.tree-CMPL machete-INSTR) - ""Cesar cleared Maria’s field with a machete.""

4. **Instrumental Case**:
   - The instrumental case is also marked by the same morpheme, as seen in examples like:
     - ""Sanke-man-ra jawen pia-kan pia-n koyaparo-0 tsáka-ke, ia-man."" (Sanken-ER-AS POS3 nephew-GEN arrow-INSTR tucunaré-AB shoot.arrow-CMPL lake-LOC) - ""Sanken killed a tucunaré fish with his nephew’s arrow, in the lake.""

5. **Locative-Directional and Temporal Cases**:
   - These functions are marked by the same morpheme, with alternative ways to mark them. Examples include:
     - ""Sabado-nin-ra ea-0 paboro-nin ka-kas-ai."" (Saturday-TEMP-AS 1-AB lake-LOC/DIR go-DES-INC) - ""On Saturday, I want to go to the lake.""

6. **Zero Marking for Recipients or Goals**:
   - Zero marking is used for recipients or goals, as seen in examples like:
     - ""Maria-nin-ra ea-0 koriki-0 meni-iba-ke."" (Maria-ER-AS 1-AB money-AB give-PST2-CMPL) - ""Maria gave me money yesterday.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Shipibo-Konibo has a productive case paradigm with the following cases:
- Ergative
- Absolutive (zero-marked)
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Locative-Directional
- Temporal

Thus, Shipibo-Konibo has 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Ergative Case**: Marked by -ak /-ek /-k.
2. **Dative Case**: Marked by -atl /-etl / -tl, -ki, -as /-es /-s, -is, -os, -us.
3. **Locative Case**: Marked by -an /-en /-n.
4. **Genitive Case**: Marked by -kate /-kte.

These cases are used productively to mark the grammatical relations of noun phrases in sentences. The grammar explicitly mentions these markers and provides examples of their usage, indicating that they are an integral part of the language's syntax.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",5 cases,4 cases
Urubú-Kaapor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urubú-Kaapor, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the basic word order and the use of the object marker ""ke"" in transitive clauses. It is clear that ""ke"" is used to mark the object in sentences where two nominals occur, indicating a distinction between subject and object.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph further elaborates on the use of ""ke"" as an object marker and its role in highlighting or focusing on certain constituents within a clause.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph confirms that ""ke"" is the only element that might be considered a case marker, specifically marking the object in transitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph does not introduce any new case markers but reinforces the use of ""ke"" in various contexts, including its role in marking objects and its use in postpositional phrases.

From the information provided, it is evident that Urubú-Kaapor has a single productive case marker, ""ke,"" which is used to mark the object in transitive clauses. There is no evidence of additional case markers for other grammatical relations such as nominative, dative, genitive, etc.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, the following observations can be made regarding the case-marking system:

1. **No Case-Marking for Subjects and Direct Objects**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that subjects and direct objects are not case-marked. This indicates that there is no nominative or accusative case marking.

2. **Dative Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the dative case, expressed by suffixes such as -si, -ta, and -ima, which indicate beneficiaries and other indirect object functions.

3. **Locative Cases**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 4 discuss locative markers such as -te (LOC), -no (LOC), -ya (ALL), and -mo (ABL). These markers indicate spatial and temporal relations.

4. **Additional Locative and Directional Markers**:
   - Paragraph 4 further elaborates on locative markers with additional specificity, such as -tika (right here/there), indicating a rich system of locative expressions.

5. **Benefactive and Causative Constructions**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions the use of postpositions like saba (to/for) for benefactive constructions and kuare (because of) for causal relations, which are not strictly case markers but function similarly in marking semantic roles.

### Conclusion:
The language Warao exhibits a system where case-marking is primarily used for peripheral or semantic relations such as locatives and datives, but not for core grammatical relations like subjects and direct objects. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Warao is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the following observations can be made regarding the presence and productivity of case marking:

1. **Nominal Modification and Genitive Marking**:
   - The text describes how nominal modification is handled in Wari'. Specifically, attributive modification is expressed similarly to possessive phrases, where the first nominal element carries a genitive morpheme (e.g., ""ca xain nein mijac"" for 'roasted pig'). This indicates the presence of a genitive case used for possessive constructions.

2. **Absence of Other Case Markings**:
   - There is no mention of other productive case paradigms for nouns such as nominative, accusative, dative, or instrumental. The examples provided focus on verb agreement with subjects and objects, but there is no evidence of morphological case marking for these roles.

3. **Productivity and Exclusivity**:
   - The genitive case appears to be the only productive case marking mentioned, used specifically for possessive constructions. There is no indication that this genitive marking extends to other syntactic functions or that other cases are marked morphologically.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The genitive case in Wari' does not seem to encode categories of the possessum like number or gender explicitly, nor does it show adjective-like properties. It is used strictly for possessive relationships, which aligns with the definition of a grammatical case.

Given these points, Wari' appears to have a single productive case, the genitive, used for possessive constructions. There is no evidence of other morphological case markings for syntactic roles.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Pronoun System (Paragraph 1)**:
   - Yagua uses clitics (Set I and Set II) to mark subjects, possessors, and objects of postpositions.
   - Set I clitics are used for subjects and possessors, while Set II clitics are used for objects.
   - These clitics are attached to verbs, nouns, and postpositions, indicating a form of agreement or reference rather than traditional case-marking.

2. **Postpositional Phrases (Paragraph 2)**:
   - Yagua is a postpositional language with a variety of postpositions indicating different semantic roles such as adlative, ablative, dative, and locative.
   - These postpositions can be suffixed to nouns and other postpositions, indicating spatial and directional relations.
   - The presence of postpositions suggests that Yagua uses adpositions rather than morphological case-marking to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

3. **Verb and Verb Phrase Structure (Paragraph 3)**:
   - The verb structure in Yagua is complex, with many suffixes and clitics that can attach to the verb to indicate various aspects of the action.
   - There is no mention of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves, but rather a reliance on verb morphology and clitics to indicate relationships.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence provided, Yagua does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on clitics and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Yagua in terms of case-marking is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can identify the following productive case markers:

1. **Object Case (-a‡n)**: This marker is used for direct objects, beneficiaries, recipients, and other directly affected entities. It is influenced by the animacy and definiteness of the noun.
2. **Directional Oblique Case (-an)**: This marker is used for allative/ablative cases, indicating directional goals and sources, and can also express general location.
3. **Oblique Case (-Vêt)**: This marker is used for various non-core participants, including locative (inanimates), instrumental (inanimates), and comitative (animates).

### Analysis:

- **Core Arguments**: The object case marker (-a‡n) is used for direct objects and other core non-subject participants.
- **Oblique Arguments**: The oblique case marker (-Vêt) covers a range of roles including locative, instrumental, and comitative.
- **Directional Marker**: The directional oblique case marker (-an) is used for indicating direction (allative/ablative) and location.

### Case Count:

1. **Nominative**: Unmarked for subjects.
2. **Accusative**: Marked by -a‡n for direct objects and other core non-subject participants.
3. **Instrumental/Comitative/Locative**: Marked by -Vêt.
4. **Allative/Ablative/Locative**: Marked by -an.

Given the distinct markers for different grammatical roles, Hup has a productive case system with at least four distinct cases:

1. **Nominative** (unmarked)
2. **Accusative** (-a‡n)
3. **Instrumental/Comitative/Locative** (-Vêt)
4. **Allative/Ablative/Locative** (-an)

### Conclusion:

4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Core Case Marking**:
   - **Nominative (S/A)**: The subject (S/A) can be zero-marked or marked with the enclitic =dɨ for topical subjects.
   - **Accusative (O)**: The object (O) can be zero-marked or marked with -na for topical objects.

2. **Oblique Case Marking**:
   - **Locative**: Marked with -mo.
   - **Ablative**: Marked with -mona.
   - **Instrumental**: Marked with -do.
   - **Benefactive-Causal**: Marked with -ri.
   - **Privative**: Marked with -(ni)no or -(ñe)no.

3. **Genitive**:
   - The genitive is marked with -ɨe for 1st and 2nd person pronouns and with the connective ie for 3rd person pronouns.

### Analysis:
- **Core Cases**: The language distinguishes between subjects (S/A) and objects (O) with specific markers for topical subjects and objects.
- **Oblique Cases**: There are five distinct oblique cases (locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative).
- **Genitive**: Although the genitive is not strictly a case as it marks relations within the NP, it is still a productive marker for possession.

### Conclusion:
Huitoto (Murui) has a productive case-marking system that includes core cases (nominative and accusative) and several oblique cases. The total number of distinct cases, including the genitive, is six.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, there is no explicit mention of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The text primarily discusses word order, negation, coordination, and verbal morphology, but it does not provide evidence of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, grammatical relations and roles seem to be indicated through word order and other syntactic means rather than through inflectional case markers.

### Reasoning:
1. **Word Order**: The text emphasizes the importance of word order (SVO, SOV, etc.) in conveying grammatical relations, which suggests that word order, rather than case marking, is the primary means of indicating syntactic roles.
2. **Negation and Coordination**: The sections on negation and coordination do not mention any case markers that would change the form of nouns.
3. **Verbal Morphology**: The detailed discussion on verbal morphology focuses on tense, aspect, and mood markers on verbs, without reference to case markers on nouns.
4. **Absence of Case Paradigms**: There is no mention of a system of case paradigms or any examples showing nouns inflected for case.

Given the lack of evidence for morphological case-marking in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is that Iquito does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph (d)** explicitly states that there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix ""n-"" on referential elements such as articles and pronominal forms. It also mentions that otherwise, case marking is absent.

Given this information, we can conclude that Movima does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns beyond this single oblique case. The presence of only one oblique case and the absence of other case markings suggest that Movima does not have a fully developed case system.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly mentions the presence of only one oblique case.
- There is no indication of additional cases or a more extensive case system.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Possession and Constituency**:
   - The language uses person prefixes to indicate possession for inalienable nouns (e.g., body parts and kinship terms).
   - For alienable nouns, a genitive postposition ""õ"" is used.
   - Ambivalent nouns can follow either pattern based on extralinguistic factors.

2. **Dative Postposition**:
   - The dative postposition is used to mark the sole participant in notional monovalent non-canonical predicators, which include sensations and emotions (e.g., ""m ba"" for ""be fearful"").
   - The dative postposition is also used for the A argument in bivalent non-canonical predicators, such as verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear, and desire.

3. **Ergative and Accusative Marking**:
   - Some verbs require the A argument to be marked as ergative (e.g., ""ic-t a-bari"" for ""I cannot understand you"").
   - The O argument in these constructions follows the canonical accusative pattern.

4. **Locative, Instrumental, and Inessive Postpositions**:
   - The language uses various postpositions to mark the O/E argument in different verb constructions, such as locative, instrumental, and inessive postpositions.

### Conclusion:
The language Apinayé exhibits overt marking for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives, instrumentals, and datives. However, it does not show a productive case paradigm for core syntactic functions like nominative or accusative beyond these peripheral cases. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Apinayé is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - It mentions that case markers in Kakua are enclitics and identifies specific cases: object case, locative case, and comitative/instrumental case.
   - Examples provided show the use of these cases:
     - Object case: `=diʔ`
     - Locative case: `=bǔ`
     - Comitative/Instrumental case: `=hiʔ̃́`

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It further elaborates on the case-marking system and provides a summary table:
     - Object case: `=diʔ`
     - Locative case: `=bǔ`
     - Instrumental/Comitative case: `=hiʔ̃́`
     - Terminative case: `pɨ` (noted as a preposition)

3. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Provides examples and further details on the use of the comitative/instrumental case and the terminative case.
   - The terminative case is marked by the preposition `pɨ`.

### Analysis:
- The language Kakua has explicit morphological markers for the object, locative, and comitative/instrumental cases.
- The terminative case is marked by a preposition, which is not typically counted as a morphological case marker in the strict sense of productive case paradigms of nouns.
- Therefore, the productive case paradigms of nouns in Kakua include the object, locative, and comitative/instrumental cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Kakua has **3 cases**.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",4 cases,3 cases
Yuracare,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurakaré, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Vocative Marker**:
   - The vocative plural marker `-ypa` is mentioned, which is used when addressing a group. However, vocative markers are not considered part of the productive case paradigms for the purpose of determining the number of cases.

2. **Postpositional Clitics**:
   - The language uses postpositional clitics to mark grammatical relations, specifically for less central participants. The clitics listed are:
     - `=tina` (comitative)
     - `=la` (instrument)
     - `=y` (locative)
     - `=chi` (direction)
     - `=jsha` (ablative)

   - The grammar explicitly states that these markers are considered postpositions rather than case markers. This distinction is based on their function and attachment as phrasal enclitics, aligning more with adpositions than with synthetic case markers.

3. **Analytic vs. Synthetic Marking**:
   - The markers are described as analytic rather than synthetic, attaching to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. This further supports the classification of these markers as adpositions rather than cases.

Given this information, Yurakaré does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on postpositional clitics to mark certain grammatical relations, which are considered more peripheral and thus fall under the category of adpositions.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, the language exhibits a productive case-marking system for nouns. The cases are marked by suffixes and include the following:

9. **Illative**: Marked by -iñ.
10. **Adessive**: Marked by -ents̈.

The grammar explicitly states that Camsá has nine cases, and these cases are used productively across various noun types, including common nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, and loanwords. The cases cover a range of grammatical and semantic functions, including possession, location, direction, and accompaniment.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Kadiwéu, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Semantic Role Markers**: The paragraph mentions that Kadiwéu has six semantic role markers: -d: ‘theme’, -gi ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ~ -lo 'benefactive', -k 'allative', and lokom 'adessive'. These markers are used to indicate various semantic roles such as theme, goal, dative, benefactive, allative, and adessive.

2. **Pronominal Clitics and Affixes**: It is noted that in Kadiwéu, it is the pronominal clitics and affixes that co-occur with semantic case morphology, rather than nouns. This suggests that the case-marking system is primarily applied to pronouns rather than to nouns directly.

3. **Subject and Object Markers**: The paragraph specifies that subject markers must be followed by either -d: (agent subjects) or -d: 'theme'. Direct object markers must be followed by -d: ‘theme’. Indirect object enclitics must be followed by one of the semantic role markers mentioned earlier.

Given this information, it appears that Kadiwéu does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses semantic role markers that are primarily applied to pronominal clitics and affixes. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or semantic case relations.

**Reasoning**:
- The case markers are used for semantic roles and are applied to pronominal clitics and affixes rather than nouns.
- The markers indicate roles such as theme, goal, dative, benefactive, allative, and adessive, which are concrete or semantic case relations.
- There is no indication of a productive case paradigm for nouns themselves.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Karajá,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, we can analyze the presence and type of case-marking in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Core NP Arguments:**
   - The first paragraph mentions that Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language where core NP arguments (subject and direct object) are not morphologically marked. This implies that there is no nominative or accusative case marking for these core grammatical relations.

2. **Postpositions:**
   - The second paragraph lists several postpositions with meanings such as 'stationary locative', 'dynamic locative', 'diffuse locative', 'temporal', 'ablative', 'instrumental', 'dative', 'allative', 'evitative', 'comitative', and 'comparative'.
   - These postpositions indicate that Karajá uses postpositional phrases to express various semantic relations rather than inflectional case marking on nouns.
   - The presence of postpositions like 'dative' and 'allative' suggests that these roles are marked by separate words rather than by morphological case endings on the nouns themselves.

### Reasoning:

- **No Morphological Case-Marking:** The core grammatical relations (subject and direct object) are not marked morphologically, which suggests the absence of a nominative-accusative case system.
- **Exclusively Borderline Case-Marking:** The language uses postpositions to mark peripheral or semantic relations such as locative, ablative, instrumental, dative, etc. These are not integrated into a productive case paradigm but are instead separate lexical items.

Given the information, Karajá does not exhibit a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to indicate various semantic roles.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Baure,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Baure, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses word order, subject and object arguments, and the use of locative suffixes. The locative suffix -ye is mentioned as a marker for locative arguments, but there is no indication of a broader system of morphological case-marking for other grammatical relations.

Given the information, it appears that Baure does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns, but rather relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate these relationships.

### Reasoning:
1. The text discusses the order of arguments (subject, object) and their relationship to the predicate without mentioning specific case markers for these roles.
2. The locative suffix -ye is the only morphological marker mentioned, and it is used for locative arguments, which suggests a limited or peripheral use of case marking.
3. There is no indication of a broader system of morphological case-marking for other grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
