Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken in Ethiopia, exhibits a relatively limited case system compared to some other languages. In Amharic, case marking is primarily achieved through the use of suffixes and prepositions. The primary cases in Amharic include:

1. **Nominative**: This is the default case for the subject of a sentence and is typically unmarked.
2. **Accusative**: This case marks the direct object of a verb and is often marked by the suffix ""-n"".
3. **Genitive**: This case indicates possession and is marked by the suffix ""-ə"".

In addition to these, Amharic also uses prepositions to indicate other relationships, such as locative, instrumental, and others. However, these prepositions do not form a productive case paradigm in the same way that suffixes do in languages with more extensive case systems.

Given this information, Amharic can be classified as having 3 cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Beja,"Beja, also known as Bedawi, is a Cushitic language spoken by the Beja people in parts of Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt. In terms of its grammatical structure, Beja exhibits a relatively simple case system. The language primarily uses two cases: the nominative and the accusative. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Nominative Case:** This case is used for the subject of a sentence.
   - **Accusative Case:** This case is used for the direct object of a sentence.
   
   The distinction between these two cases is marked morphologically, meaning that nouns take different forms depending on their syntactic role in the sentence. This binary case system is typical of many languages that have a nominative-accusative alignment, where the subject of an intransitive verb and the subject of a transitive verb are treated the same (nominative), while the object of a transitive verb is treated differently (accusative).

Conclusion: 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"The Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Berber, generally do not have a rich system of morphological case-marking. Instead, they rely more on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. The primary morphological distinction in Berber nouns is between the ""free state"" and the ""construct state,"" which is not typically considered a full-fledged case system in the traditional sense of nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

The ""free state"" is used for nouns in isolation or in certain syntactic positions, while the ""construct state"" is used when the noun is in a possessive construction or follows certain prepositions. This distinction is more about syntactic positioning and does not cover a wide range of grammatical functions typically associated with a case system.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Middle Atlas Berber in terms of case-marking would be:

1. The language does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that would fit into the traditional categories of nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
2. The distinction between ""free state"" and ""construct state"" does not constitute a full case system but rather a syntactic alternation.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Diola-Fogny,"Diola-Fogny, a language spoken in Senegal, is known for its lack of morphological case-marking. This means that nouns in Diola-Fogny do not change form to indicate their grammatical function within a sentence, such as subject, object, or possessive. Instead, the language relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to convey these relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Diola-Fogny does not exhibit productive case paradigms for nouns.
   - The language does not use morphological changes to indicate grammatical roles like nominative, accusative, or genitive.
   - Instead, it relies on syntactic structures and word order to convey the relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

5. Locative
6. Ablative
7. Instrumental

Given this information, Gimira has a total of 7 distinct cases. Therefore, the appropriate category for Gimira's case system is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"Grebo is a Kru language spoken in Liberia. Kru languages, including Grebo, are known for their lack of morphological case-marking. Instead of using inflectional morphology to indicate grammatical relations, these languages typically rely on word order and other syntactic strategies. 

In Grebo, like in many other Kru languages, the relationships between nouns and their grammatical functions (such as subject, object, etc.) are indicated through syntactic means rather than through a system of morphological cases. This means that Grebo does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"Igbo is a language spoken primarily in Nigeria and is part of the Niger-Congo language family. In the context of grammatical case, Igbo does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, Igbo relies heavily on word order, prepositions, and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Igbo does not have a system of inflectional morphology that marks nouns for case. Instead, grammatical relationships are indicated through word order and the use of prepositions.
   - **Syntactic Strategies:** The language uses syntactic strategies such as subject-verb-object (SVO) word order to indicate grammatical relations. For example, the subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.
   - **Prepositions:** Prepositions are used to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For instance, locative and instrumental relations are expressed through prepositions rather than case endings.
   - **Lack of Inflection:** There is no evidence of inflectional endings on nouns that would indicate different cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).

Given these characteristics, Igbo does not fit into any of the categories that involve multiple cases or even exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"Iraqw is a Cushitic language spoken in Tanzania. In the context of grammatical case, Iraqw does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Studies**: Research on Iraqw, such as the work by Mous (1993), indicates that the language does not have a productive system of case marking for nouns. Instead, syntactic roles are primarily indicated through word order and other grammatical constructions.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: As a Cushitic language, Iraqw shares typological features with other languages in the family, many of which also lack extensive case-marking systems.
3. **Grammatical Structure**: Iraqw uses prepositions and postpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. This further supports the lack of a morphological case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda, a Bantu language spoken in Rwanda, does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on a combination of word order, prepositions, and agreement markers on verbs and adjectives to indicate grammatical relationships. This is typical of many Bantu languages, which generally do not use morphological case-marking.

In Kinyarwanda, the grammatical functions of nouns are primarily indicated through the use of noun class prefixes and concordial agreement with verbs, adjectives, and other modifiers. These prefixes and agreement markers serve to indicate the syntactic roles of nouns within sentences, but they do not constitute a case system in the traditional sense.

Given this information, Kinyarwanda falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koromfe,"Koromfe, a Gur language spoken in Burkina Faso and Mali, does not exhibit a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

This typological feature is characteristic of many languages in the Gur family, where morphological case-marking is generally absent.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Koromfe does not use inflectional morphology to mark cases on nouns. Instead, syntactic relations are primarily indicated through word order and the use of prepositions.
2. **Typological Consistency**: This feature aligns with the broader typological characteristics of the Gur language family, which typically does not employ morphological case-marking.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions and studies of Koromfe grammar do not report the presence of a productive case system. Instead, they highlight the use of syntactic strategies and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lango,"Lango, a Nilotic language spoken in Uganda, exhibits a typological feature that is relevant to the determination of its case system. In Lango, there is no productive case-marking paradigm for nouns akin to those found in languages with rich inflectional morphology like Latin or Russian. Instead, Lango relies heavily on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements within a sentence.

The language does not have a system of morphological case-marking where nouns change form to reflect their syntactic or semantic roles. Instead, relational meanings such as location, direction, and possession are typically expressed through prepositional phrases rather than through inflectional changes to the noun itself.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Lango in terms of its case system is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Murle,"Murle is a language spoken in South Sudan, primarily by the Murle people. It belongs to the Surmic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. In examining the morphological structure of Murle, particularly its case-marking system, it is important to note that Murle does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do.

Instead, Murle relies heavily on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This means that Murle does not use morphological case-marking to indicate roles such as subject, object, or indirect object. 

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Murle in terms of its case-marking system is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Nama,"Nama, also known as Khoekhoe, is a language belonging to the Khoisan language family, primarily spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.

Oromo (Harar),"Oromo (Harar) is a Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia. In terms of its case system, Oromo (Harar) has a relatively simple case marking system compared to many other languages. The primary cases in Oromo (Harar) include:

1. **Nominative**: This is the default case used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: This case is used for the direct object of a sentence.
3. **Genitive**: This case is used to indicate possession.
4. **Dative**: This case is used to indicate the indirect object of a sentence.

These four cases are the primary productive cases in Oromo (Harar). While there are other forms and markers that can indicate locative or instrumental relations, these are often considered more peripheral and not part of the core productive case system.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases are clearly marked and productive in the language.
- Other markers for locative or instrumental relations are not as systematically integrated into the core case system and are often considered peripheral.

**Conclusion**: 4 cases",6-7 cases,4 cases
Sango,"Sango is a creole language based on the Ngbandi language, and it is primarily spoken in the Central African Republic. As a creole, Sango has undergone significant simplification in its grammatical structures compared to its parent languages.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Turkana,"Turkana, a Nilotic language spoken in Kenya, exhibits a system of case marking that is not as extensive or productive as those found in languages with rich case systems like Finnish or Russian. Instead, Turkana primarily uses a combination of word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within a sentence. 

While Turkana does have some morphological markers that could be interpreted as case markers, these are generally limited to specific functions such as locative or instrumental relations, rather than a full-fledged case system that marks a wide range of syntactic roles. This limited use of morphological marking for specific relational functions aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Limited Morphological Marking**: Turkana does not have a broad, productive case system that marks a wide range of syntactic roles. Instead, it uses specific markers for certain relational functions.
2. **Use of Prepositions and Word Order**: The language relies more on prepositions and word order to convey grammatical relationships, which is typical of languages with limited or no case marking.
3. **Specific Relational Functions**: The morphological markers that do exist in Turkana are primarily for locative or instrumental cases, which are considered peripheral or semantic cases rather than core grammatical cases like nominative or accusative.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yoruba,"Yoruba is a language spoken predominantly in Nigeria and belongs to the Niger-Congo language family. It is an analytic language, meaning it relies more on word order and function words rather than inflection to convey grammatical relationships. In the context of grammatical cases, Yoruba does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it uses prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships such as subject, object, and possession.

For example:
- Subject: ""Ọmọkùnrin náà ń jẹun"" (The boy is eating)
- Object: ""Mo rí ọmọkùnrin náà"" (I saw the boy)
- Possession: ""Ilé ọmọkùnrin náà"" (The boy's house)

These relationships are indicated without altering the form of the noun ""ọmọkùnrin"" (boy). Instead, Yoruba uses prepositions and possessive constructions to convey meanings that other languages might express through case inflections.

1. **Reasoning**: Yoruba does not have productive case paradigms for nouns. It relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships, which means it does not use morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Seme,"To determine the number of cases in the language Seme, we need to examine the productive case paradigms of nouns in Seme. This involves identifying whether Seme uses morphological markers to indicate grammatical relationships such as nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, and other potential cases.

Unfortunately, I don't have specific information on the language Seme. However, based on the general typological patterns of languages, we can consider the following possibilities:

1. **No morphological case-marking**: If Seme does not use any morphological markers to indicate grammatical relationships and relies solely on word order or prepositions, this would be the appropriate category.

2. **2 cases**: If Seme has a minimal case system, typically distinguishing between nominative (subject) and accusative (object) cases, it would fall into this category.

3. **3 cases**: If Seme distinguishes between nominative, accusative, and genitive (possessive) cases, it would be classified here.

4. **4 cases**: If Seme has an additional case, such as dative (indirect object), along with nominative, accusative, and genitive, it would be in this category.

5. **5 cases**: If Seme has five distinct cases, including perhaps an instrumental or locative case, it would be classified here.

6. **6-7 cases**: If Seme has a more complex case system with six or seven distinct cases, it would fall into this category.

7. **8-9 cases**: If Seme has eight or nine distinct cases, it would be classified here.

8. **10 or more cases**: If Seme has a highly complex case system with ten or more distinct cases, it would fall into this category.

9. **Exclusively borderline case-marking**: If Seme only marks peripheral or semantic relations such as locatives or instrumentals and does not have a full case system for core grammatical relations, it would be classified here.

Given the lack of specific information on Seme, I cannot definitively determine the number of cases. However, based on the options provided and the typical range of case systems in languages, I would need more detailed information about the morphological structure of Seme to make an accurate classification.

**Conclusion:** Insufficient information to determine the number of cases in Seme.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"Koyra Chiini, a Songhay language spoken primarily in Mali, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines, does not have a productive case system for nouns in the same way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, it uses a system of markers to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns. These markers are often referred to as ""case markers,"" but they function differently from the inflectional case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian.

In Tagalog, the markers are typically divided into three main categories:

1. **Nominative (or absolutive)**: This marker indicates the subject of an intransitive verb or the direct object of a transitive verb.
2. **Genitive (or ergative)**: This marker indicates the subject of a transitive verb or possession.
3. **Oblique**: This marker indicates various other roles, such as indirect objects, locations, and instruments.

These markers are not inflectional endings attached to nouns but are separate particles that precede the noun. Because of this, Tagalog does not have a morphological case system in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses a combination of particles and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Tagalog in terms of case-marking is:

**Reasoning:**
1. Mian has a nominative case for marking subjects.
2. It uses an accusative case for marking direct objects.
3. A genitive case is used for possessive relationships.
4. A dative case is employed for indirect objects.
5. Locative and instrumental cases are used for marking location and means, respectively.

These cases are productive and regularly used in the language, indicating a robust case-marking system.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Inanwatan,"Inanwatan, a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. According to linguistic studies and typological surveys, Inanwatan does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Lack of Productive Case Paradigms**: Inanwatan does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical roles (such as subject, object, etc.) within a sentence.
   - **Alternative Grammatical Strategies**: The language uses other strategies, such as fixed word order and prepositions, to convey the relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.
   - **Typological Evidence**: Studies and typological databases, such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), indicate that Inanwatan lacks morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"Abui, a Papuan language spoken in Indonesia, exhibits a system of case-marking that is primarily focused on peripheral or semantic relations rather than core grammatical functions like nominative or accusative. The language uses postpositions to mark locative, instrumental, and other peripheral roles, but it does not have a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations on nouns.

In Abui, the marking of roles such as agent, patient, or recipient is typically achieved through word order and verb agreement rather than through morphological case-marking on the nouns themselves. The presence of postpositions for locative and instrumental functions indicates that the language has some form of marking for peripheral cases, but these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as seen in languages with nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive cases.

Given this information, Abui falls under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" because it has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, and lacks a productive case paradigm for core grammatical functions.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awtuw,"Awtuw, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case-marking system. The language primarily uses case markers to indicate syntactic roles such as subject and object, but it does not have an extensive array of cases like some other languages.

In Awtuw, there are two primary cases:
1. Nominative: used for the subject of a sentence.
2. Accusative: used for the direct object of a sentence.

These two cases are sufficient to cover the basic syntactic functions required in the language. There are no additional productive case paradigms for other roles such as locative, instrumental, or genitive that would increase the number of cases beyond these two.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",5 cases,2 cases

The primary cases in Nez Perce are:
1. Nominative: used for the subject of a sentence.
2. Accusative: used for the direct object of a sentence.
3. Genitive: used to indicate possession.
4. Dative: used to indicate the indirect object or the recipient of an action.

These four cases are clearly marked and productive in the language, allowing for the differentiation of grammatical roles within sentences.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",10 or more cases,4 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. It is a polysynthetic language, which means that it tends to use complex words composed of many morphemes to express what would be entire sentences in other languages. Oneida does not use morphological case-marking on nouns to indicate grammatical relations such as subject, object, or possession. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology and word order to convey these relationships.

In Oneida, the roles of nouns in sentences are typically indicated through verb agreement and the use of pronominal prefixes on verbs, rather than through changes to the form of the nouns themselves. This means that Oneida lacks a productive case system for marking nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. Oneida is a polysynthetic language that uses verb morphology and pronominal prefixes to indicate grammatical relations.
2. There is no evidence of a productive case system for nouns in Oneida.
3. The language relies on verb agreement and word order rather than morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"To determine the number of cases in Southeastern Pomo, we need to examine the morphological structure of the language, particularly how it marks grammatical relations on nouns. Southeastern Pomo is a member of the Pomoan language family, traditionally spoken in Northern California.

Southeastern Pomo does not exhibit a rich system of case marking. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships. The language primarily uses postpositions rather than inflectional case endings to mark relationships such as location, direction, and instrumentality. This suggests that Southeastern Pomo does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense.

Given this information, Southeastern Pomo falls into the category of languages with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This means that while it may have some markers for specific semantic roles (like locatives or instrumentals), it does not have a fully developed system of morphological case marking for syntactic functions.

Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) is a language that belongs to the Uto-Aztecan family and is spoken in the region of Tetelcingo, Morelos, Mexico. In terms of its morphological structure, Nahuatl is known for its agglutinative nature, where words are often formed by stringing together morphemes, each contributing a specific meaning or grammatical function.

In Nahuatl (Tetelcingo), the concept of grammatical case as seen in many Indo-European languages is not present. Instead, Nahuatl relies heavily on prepositions and postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. The language uses a system of relational nouns and possessive constructions to express what might be considered case relationships in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental relations are typically expressed through the use of relational nouns rather than through inflectional case endings on the nouns themselves.

Given this information, Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses other grammatical means to express relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Catalan,"Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns. This is typical of many Romance languages, which have largely lost the inflectional case systems that were present in their Latin ancestor. In Catalan, the roles that might be marked by cases in other languages are instead indicated by prepositions (e.g., ""de"" for genitive, ""a"" for dative) and syntactic position.

**Reasoning:**
- Catalan nouns do not inflect for case.
- Grammatical relationships are indicated by prepositions and word order.
- This aligns with the typological characteristics of Romance languages, which generally lack productive case paradigms for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a West Germanic language spoken in the Netherlands, exhibits a relatively simple case system compared to many other languages. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but modern Western Frisian has largely lost these distinctions.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Context:** Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system similar to Old English and Old High German, with nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases.
   - **Modern Usage:** In contemporary Western Frisian, the case system has been significantly reduced. The language primarily relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships rather than inflectional case markings.
   - **Current Case System:** Modern Western Frisian retains some vestiges of the old case system, particularly in pronouns. However, for nouns, the productive case system has been reduced to a minimal distinction, primarily between nominative and genitive cases. The genitive case is not highly productive and is often replaced by prepositional phrases in everyday usage.
   - **Borderline Case-Marking:** There are some remnants of locative and instrumental cases in fixed expressions, but these are not productive and do not constitute a full case system.

Given this information, Western Frisian does not have a fully productive case system for nouns but retains some minimal distinctions.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Warao,"Warao is an indigenous language spoken by the Warao people in the northeastern region of South America, primarily in Venezuela. In terms of its grammatical structure, Warao does not exhibit a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on other means such as word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking:** Warao does not have a system of inflectional endings attached to nouns to indicate different grammatical cases. Instead, it uses postpositions, which are separate words that follow the noun to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and possession.
2. **Postpositional System:** The use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers is a key feature of Warao. This system is more akin to the use of prepositions in English, where relationships are indicated by separate words rather than morphological changes to the noun itself.
3. **Typological Classification:** In linguistic typology, languages that use postpositions and lack inflectional case markers are typically classified as having ""No morphological case-marking.""

Given these characteristics, Warao fits the description of a language with no morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",5 cases,no morphological case-marking

The language does not have a set of morphological case markers that are applied to nouns to indicate their grammatical roles within a sentence. 

1. **Reasoning**: 
   - Wari' does not use morphological case-marking to indicate grammatical relations such as subject, object, or indirect object.
   - The language employs other syntactic strategies, such as word order and the use of particles, to convey these relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that applies to nouns in Wari'.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"Yagua, a language spoken in Peru, is known for its complex morphological structure, but it does not have a productive case system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, Yagua relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. 

In Yagua, noun phrases are typically marked for their syntactic roles through the use of verbal affixes and particles rather than through a system of nominal case inflections. This means that while there may be some markers that indicate specific roles or relations (such as locative or instrumental), these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of grammatical case.

Given this information, Yagua falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" because it does not have a productive system of case paradigms for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Huitoto (Murui),"Huitoto (Murui), a language of the Witotoan family spoken in Colombia and Peru, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on marking peripheral or semantic relations rather than core syntactic functions such as subject or object. The language uses postpositions and suffixes to indicate various locative, instrumental, and other peripheral relations. However, it does not have a fully developed system of morphological case marking for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

Given this information, Huitoto (Murui) does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that marks core syntactic functions. Instead, it relies on markers for more concrete or peripheral relations.

1. **Reasoning**: Huitoto (Murui) uses postpositions and suffixes to mark locative, instrumental, and other peripheral relations, but it lacks a fully developed system of morphological case marking for core grammatical relations such as nominative or accusative. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Iquito,"Iquito, a language spoken in Peru, belongs to the Zaparoan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Iquito does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other syntactic and morphological strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This is characteristic of many languages in the Amazonian region, where case-marking is often minimal or absent.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Productive Case Paradigms:** Iquito does not have a system of productive case paradigms for marking nouns. This means that nouns in Iquito do not change form to indicate different grammatical roles such as subject, object, or indirect object.
   - **Alternative Strategies:** Instead of case-marking, Iquito uses word order and other grammatical markers to convey syntactic relationships. This is a common feature in languages that lack morphological case-marking.
   - **Typological Context:** Many languages in the Amazonian region, including those in the Zaparoan family, tend to have minimal or no morphological case-marking. This typological pattern supports the conclusion that Iquito follows a similar structure.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"Movima is a language spoken in Bolivia, and it belongs to the Movima language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Movima does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships within sentences.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Movima does not use morphological case markers on nouns to indicate grammatical relations such as subject, object, or possessive. Instead, it uses word order, verb morphology, and other syntactic strategies to convey these relationships.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: Many languages in the Amazonian and Andean regions, including Movima, tend to avoid extensive case-marking systems. They often rely on other means such as verb affixes, particles, or word order to indicate grammatical relations.

   - The language does not employ overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations like locatives or instrumentals in a manner that would constitute a case system.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Cacua,"Cacua, a language spoken by the Cacua people in Colombia, is part of the Tucanoan language family. Tucanoan languages are generally known for their complex morphosyntactic structures, but they do not typically employ extensive case-marking systems. Instead, these languages often rely on other grammatical strategies, such as word order and verb morphology, to indicate syntactic relationships.

In the case of Cacua, the language does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses other means, such as postpositions and verb agreement, to convey grammatical relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Productive Case Paradigms**: Cacua does not exhibit a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions and verb morphology to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: As a member of the Tucanoan language family, Cacua aligns with the typological characteristics of the family, which generally do not include extensive case systems.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Cacua and related languages in the Tucanoan family emphasize the use of other grammatical strategies over morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Yuracare,"Yuracare, a language spoken in Bolivia, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and adpositions, to indicate grammatical relationships. This characteristic places Yuracare in the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: Yuracare does not have a system of inflectional endings or affixes that mark different grammatical cases on nouns. This absence of morphological case-marking means that nouns do not change form to indicate their syntactic roles (such as subject, object, etc.).
2. **Alternative Strategies**: Instead of using case markers, Yuracare employs word order and adpositions to convey the relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This is a common strategy in languages without morphological case systems.
3. **Typological Classification**: In linguistic typology, languages are often classified based on whether they use morphological case-marking or other strategies. Yuracare falls into the category of languages that do not use morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Camsá,"Camsá, also known as Kamsá or Sibundoy, is a language spoken by the Camsá people in Colombia. It is an indigenous language that has been studied to some extent, but detailed grammatical descriptions are relatively scarce compared to more widely spoken languages.

Based on the available linguistic research, Camsá does not exhibit a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This characteristic aligns with languages that do not employ morphological case-marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: The primary evidence from linguistic studies on Camsá indicates that the language does not use inflectional morphemes to mark cases on nouns. Instead, it uses other means such as word order and possibly adpositions to convey grammatical relationships.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: Many indigenous languages of the Americas, including Camsá, often do not have extensive case systems. They tend to use other syntactic or morphological strategies to indicate grammatical roles.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Camsá grammar do not mention a system of cases akin to those found in languages like Latin, Russian, or Finnish. The absence of such descriptions suggests that Camsá does not utilize a case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Karajá,"Karajá is a language spoken by the Karajá people in Brazil. It belongs to the Macro-Jê language family. The language is known for its relatively simple morphological structure, especially in terms of case marking.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Karajá does not exhibit a complex system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and context to convey grammatical relationships between nouns and verbs.
   - The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental relations are expressed through postpositions rather than through inflectional case endings.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that marks syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, or dative directly on the noun.

Given this information, Karajá does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"Baure is an Arawakan language spoken in Bolivia. In terms of its grammatical structure, Baure does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies such as word order and prepositions to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This absence of a productive case paradigm means that Baure falls into the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Analysis**: Studies and descriptions of Baure grammar indicate that the language does not employ a system of morphological case-marking for its nouns. Instead, syntactic roles are typically indicated through word order and the use of prepositions.
2. **Typological Classification**: In the context of linguistic typology, Baure is classified as a language without morphological case-marking. This classification is based on the absence of inflectional morphemes that would otherwise mark cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
3. **Comparative Evidence**: When compared to other Arawakan languages, many of which also lack extensive case-marking systems, Baure fits the pattern of relying on syntactic and lexical means rather than morphological case distinctions.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
