In Bantu languages, noun class systems play a significant role in agreement and syntactic structure, but they do not constitute a case system as defined in the context of grammatical cases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Noun Class System:** Kinyarwanda uses a complex noun class system, which involves prefixes attached to nouns that agree with verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. This system is not equivalent to a case system but rather a system of noun classification and agreement.
   - **Lack of Case Endings:** There are no distinct morphological case endings on nouns to indicate roles such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, the language uses prepositions and word order to convey these relationships.
   - **Prepositions:** Functions that might be marked by cases in other languages are often expressed using prepositions in Kinyarwanda. For example, locative relations are indicated by locative prefixes or prepositions rather than locative case endings.

Given these characteristics, Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

5. **5 cases**: Might add an instrumental or locative case.
6. **6-7 cases**: A more complex system, possibly including nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, and ablative.
7. **8-9 cases**: Even more complex, adding cases like vocative, allative, or others.
8. **10 or more cases**: Highly inflected languages like Finnish or Hungarian.
9. **Exclusively borderline case-marking**: Only peripheral or semantic cases like locatives or instrumentals are marked.

Given that Seme is not a widely documented language in major linguistic databases, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer without specific data. However, based on the typological patterns observed in many lesser-documented languages, it is plausible that Seme might have a simpler case system or even no morphological case-marking at all.

**Reasoning**:
- If Seme were to have a complex case system, it would likely be documented in linguistic resources.
- Many languages with simpler syntactic structures or those that rely heavily on word order and prepositions might not use morphological case-marking.
- Without specific evidence of multiple productive case paradigms, the safest assumption is that Seme might not use morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"Koyra Chiini, a Songhay language spoken in Mali, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This typological feature is characteristic of many languages that do not employ morphological case-marking.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Koyra Chiini does not have a system of inflectional morphology that marks nouns for case.
   - Grammatical relationships such as subject, object, and indirect object are primarily indicated through word order and the use of prepositions rather than through changes in the form of the noun itself.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Koyra Chiini, which means that the language does not use morphological changes to nouns to indicate different grammatical roles.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

   - Karo Batak does not use morphological case marking to indicate grammatical relationships.
   - The language relies on syntactic strategies such as word order and prepositions rather than inflectional morphology to convey these relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Karo Batak.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands, exhibits a case system that is relatively limited in comparison to languages with extensive case paradigms. The language primarily distinguishes between two cases: the absolutive and the ergative.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Absolutive Case:** This case is used for the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb.
   - **Ergative Case:** This case is used for the subject of a transitive verb.
   
   The ergative-absolutive alignment in Chamorro is a characteristic feature of its grammatical structure. The language does not have a more extensive case system that includes additional cases such as dative, genitive, or instrumental, which are found in languages with richer case paradigms. Therefore, Chamorro can be classified as having a minimal case system with only two productive cases.

Conclusion: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases

Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"The Dani language, specifically the Lower Grand Valley Dani, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. In terms of case marking, Dani does not exhibit a complex system of inflectional morphology for nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships. 

Research and linguistic descriptions of Dani indicate that it does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. There are no distinct morphological markers that indicate different grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, relationships between nouns and their roles in sentences are typically inferred from context and word order.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Dani (Lower Grand Valley) is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Hamtai,"Hamtai, also known as Kapau, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Hamtai exhibits a relatively simple case system.

Hamtai primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a complex system of case inflections. However, it does have some morphological case-marking, particularly for indicating subject and object relations. This suggests that Hamtai has a basic nominative-accusative alignment in its case system.

Given this information, Hamtai can be classified as having 2 cases: nominative and accusative.

### Reasoning:
1. **Nominative Case**: Used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative Case**: Used for the direct object of a sentence.

These two cases are sufficient to cover the primary syntactic functions in Hamtai, and there is no evidence of a more extensive case system beyond these basic distinctions.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Ilocano,"Ilocano, a language spoken in the Philippines, does not have a productive case system for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, Ilocano relies on a combination of prepositions and particles to indicate grammatical relationships and roles within sentences. This means that the language does not use morphological case-marking to indicate the syntactic or semantic roles of nouns.

In Ilocano, the relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are typically indicated through word order and the use of prepositions or particles. For example, the subject of a sentence is usually marked by the particle ""ti,"" while the direct object can be marked by ""ti"" or ""iti,"" depending on the context. Possession can be indicated by the particle ""ni"" or ""ti"" as well, but these do not constitute a productive case system as seen in languages with clear morphological case paradigms.

Given this information, Ilocano falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on indicating the syntactic roles of noun phrases within sentences. However, it does not have a large number of distinct morphological cases like some other languages (e.g., Latin or Russian). Instead, Tagalog uses a system of markers that indicate the role of noun phrases, often referred to as ""focus"" or ""trigger"" markers. These markers are used to indicate the syntactic role of the noun phrase in relation to the verb, such as the actor, the object, the location, etc.

The primary markers in Tagalog are:
1. **Nominative (or Subject) Marker**: This is used for the subject of the sentence.
2. **Genitive (or Possessive) Marker**: This is used to indicate possession.
3. **Oblique Marker**: This is used for various other roles, such as indirect objects, locations, and instruments.

Given this system, Tagalog does not have a large number of distinct morphological cases. Instead, it has a limited set of markers that serve to indicate the grammatical relations of noun phrases.

### Reasoning:
- Tagalog uses a limited set of markers to indicate grammatical relations.
- These markers include nominative, genitive, and oblique markers.
- The system does not extend to a large number of distinct morphological cases.

2. **Syntactic Strategies**: The language employs syntactic strategies such as word order and prepositions to convey meanings that might be expressed through case marking in other languages.
3. **Typological Characteristics**: This feature aligns with the typological characteristics of many Austronesian languages, which typically do not have extensive case systems.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Una,"The language Una, also known as Goliath, is a Papuan language spoken in Papua, Indonesia. According to linguistic studies and typological data, Una has a relatively simple case system. It primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich inflectional case system. 

In Una, there are two primary cases: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. This binary distinction is typical of languages with minimal case marking.

1. **Reasoning**: Una employs a nominative-accusative alignment in its case system, with two distinct cases for marking the subject and the direct object. This minimal case system is characteristic of languages that do not rely heavily on inflectional morphology to indicate grammatical relations but rather use word order and postpositions.

Conclusion: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Usan,"Usan, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. The language primarily uses case marking to indicate grammatical relations, but it does not have an extensive array of cases.

Given this information, Duna has a total of 5 productive cases.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Taiap,"Taiap, also known as Gapun, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is a language of the Sepik family and is notable for its unique linguistic features. When examining the case system of Taiap, it is important to consider the nature of its noun morphology and how it marks grammatical relations.

Taiap does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations. There is no evidence of a systematic morphological case-marking system for core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or dative. 

However, Taiap does have some markers for locative and instrumental relations, which are more peripheral or semantic in nature. These markers are not part of a broader, productive case system but are used in specific contexts to indicate location or means.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Taiap in terms of case-marking is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This is because it has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, but lacks a broader, productive case system for core grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Mian,"Mian, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. The language exhibits overt marking primarily for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives and instrumentals, but does not have a fully developed system of syntactic case marking for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative. This means that while Mian does mark certain semantic roles, it does not have a comprehensive case system that would include multiple syntactic cases.

Given this information, Mian falls under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Reasoning:**
- Mian has overt marking for peripheral case relations (e.g., locatives, instrumentals).
- It lacks a fully developed system of syntactic case marking for core grammatical relations.

Abui,"Abui is a Papuan language spoken in the Alor archipelago of Indonesia. It is known for its complex morphology, particularly in its verb system. However, when it comes to the nominal system, Abui does not exhibit a productive case-marking paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and adpositions to indicate grammatical relations.

1. Reasoning:
   - Abui does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would correspond to the traditional grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive.
   - Instead, grammatical relations are typically indicated through word order and the use of adpositions.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm where nouns change form to indicate different syntactic or semantic roles.
   - The language does use some markers for locative and instrumental relations, but these are not part of a broader, productive case system and are better classified as adpositions or postpositions rather than morphological cases.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awtuw,"Awtuw is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea and belongs to the Sepik Hill languages. In Awtuw, the case system is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. The language primarily uses case marking to indicate syntactic relations such as subject and object, but it does not have a large number of distinct cases.

Awtuw has a nominative-accusative alignment, which means it marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs in the same way (nominative), and it marks the direct object of transitive verbs differently (accusative). Additionally, Awtuw has a genitive case to indicate possession. Beyond these, there are no extensive case paradigms for other syntactic or semantic roles.

Given this information, Awtuw can be classified as having 3 cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.

Maricopa,"Maricopa, a Yuman language spoken in Arizona, exhibits a system of case marking that is relatively limited compared to languages with extensive case systems. The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich inflectional case system. 

In Maricopa, there are a few productive case markers that can be identified:
1. **Nominative**: This is typically unmarked and is used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: This marks the direct object.
3. **Genitive**: This marks possession.

Additionally, Maricopa has markers for locative and instrumental relations, but these are often considered more peripheral or semantic cases rather than core grammatical cases.

Given this information, Maricopa does not have a large number of productive case paradigms. Instead, it has a limited set of cases that are used primarily for core grammatical relations, with additional markers for more specific semantic roles.

Conclusion: 3 cases",6-7 cases,3 cases
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"The Southern Sierra Miwok language, part of the Miwok language family, exhibits a system of case marking that is relatively limited in scope. The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich system of inflectional case marking on nouns. This characteristic aligns with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is present only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals.

In Southern Sierra Miwok, the primary method of indicating grammatical relations involves the use of postpositions rather than a productive case paradigm. This means that while there might be some markers for specific roles like locative or instrumental, these are not part of a broader, productive case system that marks a wide range of grammatical relations directly on the noun.

Given this information, Southern Sierra Miwok does not fit into categories with a specific number of cases (e.g., 2 cases, 3 cases, etc.) but rather into the category where case marking is limited to specific, often peripheral, roles.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Nez Perce,"Nez Perce is a Sahaptian language spoken in the northwestern United States. It is known for its rich morphological system, including a productive case-marking system for nouns. Nez Perce has a nominative-accusative alignment in its case system, which means that it distinguishes between the subject of a transitive verb (accusative) and the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of a transitive verb (nominative).

The primary cases in Nez Perce are:

1. **Nominative**: Marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs.
2. **Accusative**: Marks the direct object of transitive verbs.
3. **Genitive**: Marks possession.
4. **Dative**: Marks the indirect object or the recipient.
5. **Locative**: Marks location.
6. **Instrumental**: Marks the means by which an action is performed.

Given these cases, Nez Perce has a total of six productive cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The nominative and accusative cases are used to mark syntactic roles of subjects and objects.
- The genitive case is used to mark possession, fitting the criteria for inclusion as it does not encode categories of the possessum like number or gender.
- The dative case marks the indirect object or recipient, a common grammatical function.
- The locative and instrumental cases mark specific semantic roles related to location and means, respectively.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. It is a polysynthetic language, which means it tends to use complex words that incorporate a lot of grammatical information, including what might be expressed as separate words or morphemes in other languages. 

In Oneida, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically marked by prefixes and suffixes on the verb rather than by case markings on the noun. This means that Oneida does not use a system of morphological case-marking on nouns to indicate their grammatical roles within a sentence. Instead, the language relies on verb morphology and word order to convey these relationships.

Given this information, Oneida falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking"" for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"The Southeastern Pomo language, part of the Pomoan language family spoken in Northern California, does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This lack of morphological case-marking is consistent with many other languages in the region and typologically aligns with languages that do not use inflectional morphology to mark case distinctions.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Documentation**: Extensive linguistic documentation and studies on Southeastern Pomo indicate that it does not employ a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it uses other syntactic means such as word order and particles to convey grammatical relationships.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: The language typology of Southeastern Pomo aligns with other languages in the region that also lack morphological case-marking. This is a common feature among many Native American languages, which often use alternative syntactic strategies.
3. **Absence of Case Paradigms**: There is no evidence of productive case paradigms in the language. The grammatical roles of nouns are not marked by inflectional changes but are understood through context and syntactic structure.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking

However, when it comes to case marking, Squamish does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositional phrases to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

In Squamish, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated through word order rather than morphological case marking. Additionally, relational nouns and prepositions are used to express locative, instrumental, and other peripheral relations. This means that Squamish does not have a system of morphological case marking that would categorize it as having multiple cases.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Squamish in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Tunica,"Tunica is a language isolate that was historically spoken in what is now the southeastern United States. It is known for its polysynthetic structure and complex verb morphology. However, when it comes to nominal morphology, Tunica does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Tunica does not have a system of inflectional case marking on nouns. The language uses other strategies, such as word order and verb agreement, to indicate the roles of nouns in sentences. This lack of inflectional case marking means that Tunica does not fit into any of the categories that involve a specific number of cases.
   - **Polysynthetic Nature:** The polysynthetic nature of Tunica means that much of the grammatical information is encoded in the verb rather than in the noun. This includes subject and object markers that are attached to the verb, which reduces the need for case marking on nouns.
   - **Historical and Descriptive Sources:** Linguistic descriptions and historical records of Tunica, such as those by Mary Haas, who extensively documented the language, confirm the absence of a productive case system in the language.

Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, Nahuatl primarily uses prepositions and postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This means that Nahuatl relies on syntactic constructions rather than morphological case-marking to convey grammatical relationships.

In Nahuatl, noun phrases are marked for their syntactic roles through word order and the use of relational nouns or particles rather than through inflectional case endings. For example, possession is typically indicated by a possessive prefix on the noun, rather than a genitive case ending. Similarly, locative and instrumental relations are expressed through prepositional phrases rather than locative or instrumental case endings.

Given this information, Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language known for its complex consonant system and relatively simple vowel system. One of the notable features of Abkhaz is its lack of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead of using cases to indicate grammatical relationships, Abkhaz relies heavily on word order and the use of prepositions or postpositions to convey these relationships.

In Abkhaz, the syntactic functions that are typically marked by cases in other languages (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.) are not marked by inflectional morphology on the noun itself. Instead, these functions are indicated through other means, such as the use of particles or the syntactic position of the noun within the sentence.

Given this information, Abkhaz falls into the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking

7. Locative

These cases are used to mark various grammatical functions and relationships within sentences. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, the accusative for the direct object, the genitive for possession, the dative for the indirect object, the ablative for movement away from something, the instrumental for the means by which an action is performed, and the locative for location.

Given this information, Eastern Armenian falls into the category of having 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Basque,"Basque is a language isolate spoken in the Basque Country, which spans parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. It is known for its rich case system, which is used to mark various grammatical relations.

In Basque, nouns are inflected for a variety of cases. These cases include, but are not limited to, the nominative, ergative, absolutive, dative, genitive, instrumental, comitative, inessive, allative, ablative, and others. The exact number of cases can vary slightly depending on the dialect and the specific grammatical analysis, but it is generally agreed that Basque has a productive case system with more than 10 distinct cases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Basque has a well-documented and productive case system.
   - The cases in Basque include core grammatical cases (such as nominative, ergative, and absolutive) as well as a variety of locative and other peripheral cases (such as inessive, allative, and ablative).
   - The number of distinct cases in Basque typically exceeds 10, making it a language with a highly developed case system.

Conclusion: 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns. This is typical of many Romance languages, which have largely lost the inflectional case systems of their Latin ancestor. In Catalan, the roles that would be marked by cases in languages with case systems are instead indicated by prepositions (e.g., ""de"" for genitive, ""a"" for dative) and syntactic structure.

**Reasoning:**
1. Catalan nouns do not change form to indicate different grammatical cases.
2. Grammatical relationships are expressed through prepositions and word order rather than morphological changes to the noun itself.

Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a language spoken in the Netherlands, exhibits a relatively simple case system compared to many other languages. In Western Frisian, the primary cases that are morphologically marked are the nominative and genitive cases. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the genitive case indicates possession. 

However, it is important to note that the genitive case in Western Frisian is not as productive or pervasive as in languages with more extensive case systems. It is often replaced by prepositional phrases or possessive constructions in everyday usage. The accusative and dative cases, which are common in many Indo-European languages, are not distinctly marked in Western Frisian. Instead, word order and prepositions are used to indicate these grammatical relationships.

Given this information, Western Frisian can be classified as having 2 cases: nominative and genitive.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases

Huitoto (Murui),"Huitoto (Murui), a language spoken by the Murui people in Colombia and Peru, is known for its complex system of noun classification and marking. However, it does not have a productive case system in the sense of marking nouns for syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, Huitoto (Murui) employs other strategies, such as word order and verb morphology, to indicate grammatical relations.

Huitoto (Murui) does have some markers that could be considered as marking peripheral or semantic relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, but these do not form a comprehensive or productive case system. Therefore, the language does not fit into the categories of having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-7, 8-9, or 10 or more cases.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Huitoto (Murui) is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it has markers for some peripheral relations but lacks a full-fledged case system.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Iquito,"Iquito is a language spoken in Peru, belonging to the Zaparoan language family. In the context of grammatical case-marking, Iquito does not exhibit a productive case system for marking syntactic roles on nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies such as word order and prepositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Absence of Morphological Case-Marking:** Iquito does not use inflectional morphology to mark cases on nouns. There are no distinct noun endings or affixes that indicate nominative, accusative, genitive, or other syntactic roles.
   - **Alternative Strategies:** The language employs word order and prepositions to convey the relationships between nouns and verbs or other nouns. This is a common feature in languages that lack morphological case-marking.
   - **Typological Evidence:** Studies and descriptions of Iquito, such as those found in linguistic surveys and grammars, do not report the presence of a case system. Instead, they highlight the use of syntactic and lexical means to express grammatical relations.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Yuracare,"Yuracare is a language spoken by the Yuracaré people in Bolivia. It is known for its complex morphological structure, but when it comes to case marking, Yuracare does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as word order and adpositions to indicate grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Yuracare does not have a system of inflectional case marking for nouns. Instead, it uses other strategies to convey grammatical relationships, such as word order and the use of adpositions. This means that nouns in Yuracare do not change form to indicate their role in the sentence (e.g., subject, object, etc.), which is characteristic of languages with no morphological case-marking.
   - **Typological Evidence:** Studies and linguistic descriptions of Yuracare, such as those by linguists who have worked on the language, indicate that it lacks a productive case system. The language uses other syntactic and morphological means to encode grammatical relations, which aligns with the typological category of having no morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Camsá,"Camsá, also known as Kamsá, is a language spoken by the Camsá people in Colombia. It is a language isolate, meaning it has no known relatives. In terms of its grammatical structure, Camsá does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other grammatical means to indicate syntactic roles and relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Camsá does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it uses other strategies such as word order, particles, and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Camsá that would mark nouns for different grammatical functions such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - The language does not exhibit overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations like locatives or instrumentals in a way that would constitute a case system.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphological structure.

Baure,"Baure is an Arawakan language spoken in Bolivia. Upon examining the linguistic features of Baure, it becomes evident that the language does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, Baure relies more on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

In Baure, there is no extensive system of morphological case-marking that applies to nouns. The language does not have distinct morphological forms for nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, or other cases that are typically found in languages with rich case systems. Instead, relational and locative meanings are often expressed through the use of prepositions or postpositions, rather than through inflectional changes to the noun itself.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Baure in terms of case-marking is:
