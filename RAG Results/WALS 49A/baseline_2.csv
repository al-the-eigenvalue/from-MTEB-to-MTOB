Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia, exhibits a case system that is relatively limited compared to other languages with extensive case paradigms. In Amharic, the primary case distinction is between the nominative (unmarked) and the accusative (marked by the suffix -n). This accusative marking is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. Additionally, Amharic uses prepositions and postpositions to indicate other grammatical relations, such as locative, instrumental, and genitive, rather than relying on a rich system of morphological case marking.

Given this information, Amharic does not have a productive case paradigm with multiple distinct cases for different grammatical functions. Instead, it primarily uses two cases: nominative and accusative.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Beja,"Beja, also known as Bedawi, is a Cushitic language spoken by the Beja people in parts of Sudan, Egypt, and Eritrea. In terms of its grammatical structure, Beja exhibits a relatively simple case system compared to languages with extensive case paradigms.

Beja primarily distinguishes between two cases: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. This binary case system is typical of many Afro-Asiatic languages, where the distinction between subject and object is marked, but further case distinctions are not as prevalent.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Beja has a nominative case for subjects.
   - Beja has an accusative case for direct objects.
   - There is no extensive system of additional cases such as dative, genitive, locative, instrumental, etc., that are productively marked on nouns.

Berber (Middle Atlas),"The Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Berber, are known for their relatively simple morphological case systems. In Middle Atlas Berber, there is a distinction between two primary cases: the ""free state"" (also known as the ""absolute state"") and the ""construct state"" (also known as the ""annexed state""). 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Free State:** This form is used when the noun is in isolation or in certain syntactic positions, such as the subject of a verb.
   - **Construct State:** This form is used when the noun is in a possessive construction or in certain other syntactic contexts, such as being the object of a preposition.

These two cases are marked morphologically, and they serve to indicate the syntactic role of the noun within the sentence. The distinction between these two cases is productive and systematic within the language.

Given this information, Middle Atlas Berber does not have a large number of cases but does have a productive case system with two distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Diola-Fogny,"Diola-Fogny, a language spoken in Senegal, does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns.

2. **Alternative Strategies**: The language uses word order and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships, which is a common strategy in languages without morphological case-marking.
3. **Typological Classification**: According to linguistic typology, Iraqw falls into the category of languages that do not employ morphological case-marking for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda, a Bantu language spoken primarily in Rwanda, does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on a rich system of noun classes and agreement markers to indicate grammatical relationships and functions within sentences. These noun classes are marked by prefixes attached to nouns and are crucial for agreement with verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech.

In Kinyarwanda, the relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages are typically expressed through prepositions, word order, and agreement markers rather than through morphological case endings on the nouns themselves. For example, the role of subject, object, and other grammatical functions are indicated through verb conjugation and noun class prefixes rather than through changes in the form of the noun itself.

Given this information, Kinyarwanda falls under the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Turkana,"Turkana, a Nilotic language spoken in Kenya, exhibits a system of case marking that is not as extensive as those found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, Turkana primarily uses case marking for specific, often peripheral, relations such as locatives and instrumentals. This type of case marking does not cover a broad range of syntactic functions but is more focused on concrete or semantic relations.

In Turkana, the primary cases observed are locative and instrumental, which are used to mark specific spatial and functional relations. However, Turkana does not have a full-fledged case system that marks a wide variety of syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive in a productive manner across all nouns.

Given this information, Turkana falls into the category of languages with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yoruba,"Yoruba is a language spoken primarily in Nigeria and belongs to the Niger-Congo language family. It is known for its tonal nature and relatively simple morphological structure compared to languages with extensive inflectional paradigms.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Yoruba does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
   - The language uses a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order to indicate the syntactic roles of nouns.

This is characteristic of many Austronesian languages, which typically do not employ extensive case marking systems.

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Classification**: Mambai belongs to the Austronesian language family, which generally lacks extensive case marking systems. Instead, these languages often use prepositions and fixed word order to convey grammatical relationships.
2. **Grammatical Structure**: In Mambai, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are usually indicated by their position in the sentence rather than by morphological case markers.
3. **Prepositional Usage**: Mambai uses prepositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental roles are typically expressed through prepositions rather than case endings.
4. **Absence of Inflectional Paradigms**: There is no evidence of a productive inflectional paradigm for nouns that would indicate different cases. The language does not exhibit the kind of morphological complexity associated with case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Jamsay,"Jamsay, a Dogon language spoken in Mali, exhibits a system of case marking that is not as extensive as those found in languages with rich inflectional morphology. The primary function of case marking in Jamsay is to indicate peripheral or concrete relations, such as locative or instrumental roles, rather than core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

In Jamsay, the case marking is limited to these peripheral roles, and there is no productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations on nouns. This means that Jamsay does not have a full-fledged case system that marks subjects, objects, or possessors in a manner similar to languages with extensive case systems like Latin or Russian.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Jamsay's case system is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This classification reflects the fact that Jamsay has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, and does not have a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ik,"Ik, a language spoken in Uganda, is known for its complex grammatical structure. However, when it comes to case marking, Ik does not exhibit a highly developed system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Lack of Productive Case Paradigms**: Ik does not have a productive system of case paradigms for marking nouns. This means that nouns in Ik do not typically change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence.
   - **Syntactic Strategies**: Instead of using morphological case-marking, Ik primarily uses word order and other syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships between words.
   - **Peripheral Case Relations**: While Ik may have some markers for specific semantic roles like locatives or instrumentals, these are not part of a broader, productive case system. They are more akin to adpositions or other syntactic markers rather than true morphological cases.

Given these characteristics, Ik fits the category of languages that do not use morphological case-marking for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Emai,"Emai is an Edoid language spoken in Nigeria. In terms of its grammatical structure, Emai does not exhibit a productive case system for marking nouns.

Seme,"To determine the number of cases in the language Seme, we need to analyze the available linguistic data on its morphological case-marking system. Unfortunately, Seme is not a widely documented language, and specific information about its case system is not readily available in mainstream linguistic resources.

However, based on the general principles of linguistic typology and the information provided, we can make an educated guess. If Seme were to have a productive case system, it would likely fall into one of the predefined categories: No morphological case-marking, 2 cases, 3 cases, 4 cases, 5 cases, 6-7 cases, 8-9 cases, 10 or more cases, or Exclusively borderline case-marking.

Given the lack of specific data, we must consider the possibility that Seme might not have a fully developed case system, which is common in many languages around the world. Alternatively, it might have a minimal case system or rely on other grammatical mechanisms such as word order or prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No morphological case-marking:** This is a common feature in many languages, especially those that rely on word order or prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships.
   - **Exclusively borderline case-marking:** This could be a possibility if Seme uses specific markers for locative or instrumental cases but does not have a fully developed case system for other grammatical functions.

Given the lack of detailed information, the most cautious and likely conclusion is that Seme either has no morphological case-marking or has exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Arapesh (Mountain),"Arapesh (Mountain), a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate the grammatical relationships between nouns in a sentence. This characteristic is typical of many languages in the region, where case-marking is not a prominent feature.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Arapesh (Mountain) does not exhibit morphological case-marking on nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.).
2. **Alternative Grammatical Strategies**: The language uses other strategies, such as word order and prepositions, to convey grammatical relationships. This is a common feature in languages that lack morphological case-marking.
3. **Typological Context**: Many languages in the region, including other Papuan languages, also lack extensive case-marking systems, relying instead on syntactic and lexical means to indicate grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Asmat,"Asmat is a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia, and it belongs to the Asmat-Kamoro family of the Trans-New Guinea phylum. In terms of grammatical structure, Asmat does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Asmat does not have a system of inflectional case marking for nouns. The language uses other means, such as word order and possibly adpositions, to convey grammatical relationships. This is typical of many Papuan languages, which often lack extensive case systems and instead use syntactic means to indicate roles and relationships within sentences.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Batak (Karo),"The Batak (Karo) language, spoken by the Karo people in North Sumatra, Indonesia, does not exhibit a productive case marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This is characteristic of many Austronesian languages, which typically do not have extensive case systems like those found in Indo-European or Uralic languages.

In Karo Batak, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and possessive relationships are primarily indicated through word order and possessive constructions rather than through morphological case marking on the nouns themselves. This means that Karo Batak does not have a set of inflectional endings or affixes that change the form of a noun to indicate its grammatical role in a sentence.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Karo Batak in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. Chamorro primarily distinguishes between two cases: the absolutive and the ergative. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Absolutive Case:** This case is used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.
   - **Ergative Case:** This case is used for the subject of transitive verbs.
   
   These two cases are productive and are used to mark the syntactic roles of nouns within sentences. The distinction between absolutive and ergative cases is a hallmark of ergative-absolutive languages, which contrasts with the nominative-accusative alignment found in many other languages.

   Chamorro does not have a more extensive case system that includes additional cases like dative, genitive, locative, or instrumental, which are found in languages with more complex case paradigms. Therefore, the language does not fit into categories with higher numbers of cases.

Conclusion: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Daga,"Daga is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Daga is known for its relatively simple case system. The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships rather than a complex system of noun inflections.

The primary cases in Daga include the nominative (for subjects) and the accusative (for direct objects). Additionally, there are markers for locative and instrumental functions, which are more concrete or peripheral in nature. However, these markers are not part of a fully productive case paradigm but rather serve specific semantic roles.

Given this information, Daga does not have a rich system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on a limited set of markers for specific functions, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"The Dani language, specifically the Lower Grand Valley Dani, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. In terms of case marking, Dani does not exhibit a complex system of productive case paradigms for nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Hamtai does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses other syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships.
   - The language employs word order and adpositions rather than morphological case markers to indicate roles such as subject, object, and other grammatical functions.
   - There is no evidence of a systematic and productive set of morphological case markers applied to nouns in Hamtai.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Hua,"Hua, also known as Yagaria, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is known for its relatively complex system of noun inflection, including case marking. In Hua, nouns are marked for several cases, which include nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental, and others.

The presence of these multiple cases indicates that Hua has a productive case paradigm for nouns. Specifically, the number of cases in Hua falls within the range of 6-7 cases.

**Reasoning:**
Hua has a rich case system that includes at least the following cases:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Locative
- Instrumental

These cases are used to mark various grammatical functions and relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. The presence of these cases confirms that Hua has a productive case system with more than 5 cases but fewer than 8 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Ilocano,"Ilocano, an Austronesian language spoken primarily in the Philippines, does not have a productive case system for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, Ilocano relies more on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. The language uses a set of markers to indicate the roles of noun phrases, but these markers do not form a productive case paradigm as defined in the context of traditional grammatical cases.

Ilocano employs a system of focus markers (also known as topic markers) and prepositions to indicate the syntactic roles of noun phrases. These markers include:

1. **Nominative (focus) marker**: ""ti"" (for common nouns) and ""ni"" (for personal names).
2. **Genitive marker**: ""ti"" (for common nouns) and ""ni"" (for personal names).
3. **Oblique marker**: ""iti"" (for common nouns) and ""ken"" (for personal names).

However, these markers do not constitute a full-fledged case system as they do not cover a wide range of grammatical functions and are not morphologically integrated into a case paradigm. Instead, they function more like prepositions or particles that indicate specific syntactic roles.

Given this information, Ilocano does not have a productive case system for nouns as defined by traditional grammatical case paradigms.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Imonda,"Imonda, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its lack of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead of using morphological case-marking, Imonda relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Imonda does not employ morphological case-marking on nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical function (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - The language uses other means, such as word order and possibly particles or prepositions, to convey these relationships.
   - Given the definition of grammatical case and the criteria for counting cases, Imonda fits the category of languages that do not use morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",5 cases,no morphological case-marking
Atayal,"Atayal is an Austronesian language spoken in Taiwan. Austronesian languages, particularly those in Taiwan, often exhibit a system of case marking that is not as extensive as those found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, they tend to have a more limited set of cases, often focusing on marking core grammatical relations such as nominative and genitive, and sometimes including locative or instrumental cases.

In the case of Atayal, the language primarily uses a system of focus marking rather than a rich case system. This focus system is a characteristic feature of many Philippine-type Austronesian languages, where verbs are marked to indicate the syntactic role of the noun (e.g., actor focus, patient focus, etc.), rather than marking the nouns themselves with a variety of cases.

Given this typological background, Atayal does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that would fit into the categories of 2, 3, 4, or more cases. Instead, it relies on a system that is more aligned with focus marking and prepositional phrases to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Atayal in terms of case marking is ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kewa,"Kewa is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In Kewa, case marking is used to indicate the grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. The language employs a system of case suffixes to mark these relationships.

Kewa has a relatively rich case system that includes several productive case paradigms. These cases include, but are not limited to, nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental, and ablative. The presence of these multiple cases indicates that Kewa has a well-developed system for marking grammatical relations.

Given the variety of cases used in Kewa, it is appropriate to categorize the language as having 6-7 cases. This classification reflects the productive use of multiple case markers to denote different grammatical functions and relationships.

Conclusion: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kobon,"Kobon is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Kobon is known for its relatively simple case system. The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a complex system of inflectional case marking on nouns.

Kobon has a nominative-accusative alignment, and it marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs in the same way (nominative), while the direct object of transitive verbs is marked differently (accusative). However, the marking is not extensive and does not cover a wide range of cases.

Given this information, Kobon does not have a rich system of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies on a minimal set of case distinctions, primarily nominative and accusative, with additional roles often marked by postpositions rather than inflectional morphology.

Conclusion: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Kombai,"Kombai is a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In examining the case system of Kombai, it is important to note that this language does not exhibit a rich morphological case-marking system typical of languages with multiple productive cases. Instead, Kombai relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

The available linguistic data on Kombai suggests that it does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses other strategies such as postpositions and word order to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

1. **Reasoning**: Kombai does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language uses syntactic strategies like word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships, rather than inflectional case markers. This aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"Lavukaleve, a language spoken in the Solomon Islands, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on peripheral or semantic relations rather than core grammatical functions like subject or object. The language uses case markers to indicate locative, instrumental, and other similar relations, but it does not have a fully developed system of morphological case marking for core syntactic functions.

Given this information, Lavukaleve falls into the category of languages that have overt marking only for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language marks cases like locatives or instrumentals but does not have a comprehensive case system for core grammatical roles.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"Madurese, an Austronesian language spoken on the island of Madura in Indonesia, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

1. **Reasoning**: Taba does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it uses syntactic strategies such as word order and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships. This aligns with the typological characteristics of many Austronesian languages, which typically do not employ extensive case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"Tagalog, also known as Filipino, is an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines. It is known for its complex system of focus or voice, which affects the marking of the subject and the verb. However, when it comes to morphological case-marking of nouns, Tagalog does not have a productive case system in the same way that languages like Latin or Russian do.

In Tagalog, the relationships between nouns and their roles in the sentence are primarily indicated through a combination of prepositions and particles rather than through inflectional case endings. For example, the subject is often marked by the particle ""ang,"" the direct object by ""ng,"" and the indirect object by ""sa."" These particles function more like prepositions or markers rather than true morphological cases.

Given this, Tagalog does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns that fits the traditional definition of grammatical cases as outlined in the prompt. Instead, it relies on a set of particles to indicate grammatical relationships, which does not qualify as morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tukang Besi,"Tukang Besi is an Austronesian language spoken in Indonesia, specifically in the Tukang Besi Islands. In terms of its grammatical structure, Tukang Besi does not employ a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Use of Prepositions and Word Order**: The language uses prepositions and a relatively fixed word order to convey the relationships between different elements in a sentence. This is a common feature in many Austronesian languages.
3. **Absence of Peripheral Case Marking**: There is no evidence of overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations like locatives or instrumentals that would qualify it for the ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" category.

Given these characteristics, Tukang Besi fits the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Una,"Una, also known as Goliath, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Una is known to have a relatively simple case system compared to languages with extensive case paradigms.

Una primarily marks case through the use of postpositions rather than inflectional morphology on the nouns themselves. This means that instead of changing the form of the noun to indicate its grammatical role, Una typically uses separate words (postpositions) to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and possession.

Given this information, Una does not have a productive case paradigm in the traditional sense where nouns are inflected for multiple cases. Instead, it relies on postpositions to convey these relationships.

1. Reasoning: Una uses postpositions rather than inflectional morphology to mark grammatical relationships. This indicates that it does not have a productive case system where nouns are inflected for multiple cases.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Usan,"Usan is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Usan is known for its relatively simple case system. 

Usan primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich system of morphological case-marking. This means that instead of having multiple inflectional endings on nouns to indicate different grammatical roles (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.), Usan relies on separate words (postpositions) to convey these relationships.

Given this information, Usan does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages with extensive case systems (like Latin or Russian) do. Instead, it uses postpositions to fulfill the roles that cases would in other languages.

### Reasoning:
- Usan relies on postpositions rather than inflectional endings to indicate grammatical relations.
- There is no evidence of a productive system of morphological case-marking on nouns in Usan.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it is known for its complex morphosyntactic structure. One of the notable features of Yimas is its lack of a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, Yimas primarily relies on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. The language uses a system of pronominal prefixes and suffixes attached to verbs to mark the subject, object, and other grammatical roles, rather than marking these roles directly on the nouns themselves.

This reliance on verb morphology rather than noun case marking means that Yimas does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Therefore, it does not fit into the categories of having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-7, 8-9, or 10 or more cases. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" since it does not use overt marking for peripheral case relations like locatives or instrumentals on nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aghu,"Aghu, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Aghu, it is important to note that it does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, Aghu relies heavily on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

Aghu does have some markers that could be considered borderline cases, such as locative or instrumental markers, but these are not part of a fully productive case paradigm. These markers are used to indicate specific semantic roles rather than syntactic functions, and they do not form an integrated system of case marking that applies broadly across the noun system.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Aghu in terms of case-marking is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

5. Locative
6. Instrumental

These cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic functions, marking subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, possessors, locations, and instruments, respectively. Given this range, Manambu falls into the category of languages with 6-7 cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The nominative case marks the subject of a sentence.
- The accusative case marks the direct object.
- The dative case marks the indirect object.
- The genitive case marks possession.
- The locative case marks location.
- The instrumental case marks the means by which an action is performed.

These cases are productive and systematically applied to nouns in Manambu, fulfilling the criteria for a language with 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases

- Accusative (direct object)
- Genitive (possession)
- Dative (indirect object)
- Locative (location)
- Instrumental (means or instrument)

Given this information, Duna has more than five cases but fewer than ten. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for the number of cases in Duna is ""6-7 cases.""

Conclusion: 6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Taiap,"Taiap, also known as Gapun, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is a member of the Sepik language family. When analyzing the grammatical structure of Taiap, particularly in terms of case marking, it is important to note that Taiap does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Taiap does not have a system of morphological case marking for nouns. 
   - The language uses word order and other syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
   - There are no distinct morphological markers that indicate different cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc., for nouns in Taiap.

Given this information, Taiap falls under the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Mian,"Mian is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, specifically in the Sandaun Province. It belongs to the Ok family of the Trans-New Guinea languages. In Mian, the case-marking system is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms.

Mian primarily uses case markers to indicate syntactic relations such as subject and object. The language has a nominative-accusative alignment, where the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs is marked the same way (nominative), and the direct object of transitive verbs is marked differently (accusative). Additionally, Mian has a genitive case to indicate possession.

Beyond these core cases, Mian also has markers for locative and instrumental functions, which are considered peripheral or concrete cases. However, these additional markers are not part of a highly productive case system but rather serve specific semantic roles.

Given this information, Mian does not have an extensive case system with numerous productive cases. Instead, it has a limited set of core cases with some additional markers for specific functions.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Inanwatan,"Inanwatan is a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the South Bird's Head language family. Based on the linguistic data available, Inanwatan does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Inanwatan does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change their form to indicate different grammatical roles such as subject, object, or possessive. 
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and prepositions, to convey these relationships. 
   - The absence of morphological case-marking aligns with the typological characteristics of many languages in the region, which often rely on syntactic rather than morphological means to indicate grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"Abui is a Papuan language spoken in the Alor archipelago of Indonesia. In terms of its grammatical structure, Abui does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

This typological feature aligns with many other languages in the region, which also tend to avoid extensive case systems.

**Reasoning:**
- Abun does not employ a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
- Grammatical relationships are indicated through syntactic means rather than morphological inflections.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Koasati, a Muskogean language spoken by the Coushatta people in Louisiana and Texas, does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. The language uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate roles such as location, direction, and instrumentality. This means that Koasati does not have a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Inflectional Case Marking:** Koasati does not use inflectional endings on nouns to indicate grammatical case. Instead, it uses postpositions to convey relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages.
2. **Syntactic Strategies:** The language relies on word order and syntactic constructions rather than morphological changes to indicate grammatical roles.
3. **Postpositions:** The use of postpositions in Koasati serves functions similar to those of cases in other languages, but they do not constitute a productive case paradigm.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Maricopa,"Maricopa, a Yuman language spoken in Arizona, exhibits a system of case marking that is relatively limited. The language primarily uses suffixes to mark case relations, but these are not extensive. The primary cases identified in Maricopa include the nominative, accusative, and genitive, which are used to mark the subject, direct object, and possessive relationships, respectively. Additionally, there are locative and instrumental markers, which are used for indicating location and means or instrument, respectively.

Given this information, Maricopa does not have a highly elaborate case system with numerous distinctions. Instead, it has a small set of productive case markers that cover the basic syntactic and some peripheral semantic relations.

**Reasoning:**
- Maricopa has nominative, accusative, and genitive cases for basic syntactic functions.

6. **Instrumental**: Used to indicate the means by which an action is performed.

Given this information, Nez Perce has at least six distinct cases that are productively used in its grammar. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Nez Perce in terms of the number of cases is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. In terms of its grammatical structure, Oneida is known for its polysynthetic nature, meaning that it tends to form complex words with many morphemes. This characteristic often results in the encoding of grammatical relations within the verb rather than through the use of separate case markers on nouns.

In Oneida, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and various other roles are typically indicated by pronominal prefixes on the verb rather than by case markings on the nouns. This means that Oneida does not use a productive case system to mark nouns for their syntactic or semantic roles. Instead, the language relies on verb morphology to convey these relationships.

Given this information, Oneida does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Therefore, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Oneida is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"To determine the number of cases in Southeastern Pomo, we need to examine the morphological case-marking system of the language. Southeastern Pomo is a member of the Pomoan language family, traditionally spoken in Northern California. 

Southeastern Pomo, like other Pomoan languages, is known for its relatively simple case-marking system. The language primarily uses postpositions rather than a rich system of inflectional case markers. The primary cases that are marked morphologically in Southeastern Pomo are the nominative (or absolutive) and the accusative (or ergative), depending on the alignment system. Additionally, there are markers for locative and instrumental functions, but these are often considered peripheral or concrete cases rather than core grammatical cases.

Given this information, Southeastern Pomo does not have a large number of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies on a few core cases and uses postpositions for other relational functions.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Southeastern Pomo primarily uses nominative/absolutive and accusative/ergative cases.
   - It also has markers for locative and instrumental functions, which are considered peripheral cases.
   - The language does not exhibit a rich system of inflectional case markers beyond these core and peripheral cases.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Slave,"Slave, also known as Slavey, is an Athabaskan language spoken in Canada. Athabaskan languages, including Slave, typically do not have a rich system of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, they tend to rely heavily on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations and roles within a sentence. 

In Slave, the primary means of indicating grammatical relationships is through the use of verb prefixes and other verbal morphology rather than through case markings on nouns. This aligns with the general typological characteristics of Athabaskan languages, which are known for their complex verb structures and relatively simple noun structures.

Given this information, Slave does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages with rich case systems (like Latin or Russian) do. Instead, it uses other grammatical mechanisms to convey the same kinds of relationships that cases would in other languages.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"Squamish, also known as Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, is a language of the Coast Salish family spoken in British Columbia, Canada. In terms of its grammatical structure, Squamish does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositional phrases to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This is typical of many Salishan languages, which generally lack morphological case-marking.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Squamish does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
   - Grammatical relationships are indicated through word order and prepositional phrases rather than through inflectional case endings.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Squamish that would classify it under any of the categories with a specific number of cases.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Tunica,"Tunica is a language isolate that was historically spoken in what is now the southeastern United States. It is known for its polysynthetic structure and complex verb morphology. However, when it comes to noun morphology, Tunica does not exhibit a productive case-marking system. Instead, syntactic relations are typically indicated through word order and verb morphology rather than through inflectional case endings on nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Tunica does not have a system of inflectional case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical mechanisms such as word order and verb morphology to indicate syntactic roles.
   - There are no productive paradigms of noun cases that mark grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - The language does not employ overt marking for peripheral case relations such as locatives or instrumentals in a systematic way that would constitute a case system.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Washo,"Washo is a Native American language spoken in the region around Lake Tahoe in the United States. It belongs to the Hokan language family, although this classification is somewhat controversial. Washo is known for its complex morphology, but it does not have a productive case system for marking nouns.

In Washo, syntactic relations such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated by word order and verb agreement rather than by morphological case marking on nouns. There are some postpositions that can indicate locative or instrumental relations, but these do not constitute a productive case system in the sense defined by grammatical case paradigms.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Washo regarding the number of cases is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wichita,"Wichita is a Caddoan language spoken by the Wichita people in Oklahoma. It is known for its polysynthetic nature, which means it tends to use complex verb forms that incorporate a lot of information, including what would be expressed by separate words in other languages. 

In terms of case marking, Wichita does not use morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. The language uses a system of pronominal prefixes on verbs to indicate the subject and object, rather than marking the nouns themselves for case. This means that the grammatical roles of nouns are not indicated by changes in the form of the nouns (i.e., there are no productive case paradigms for nouns).

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Wichita in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Wintu, a Native American language of the Wintu-Nomlaki branch of the Penutian family, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. Wintu primarily uses case marking to indicate syntactic relations such as subject, object, and possessive.

In Wintu, there are three primary cases:
1. **Nominative**: Used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: Used for the direct object of a sentence.
3. **Genitive**: Used to indicate possession.

These cases are marked morphologically on nouns, making Wintu a language with a productive case paradigm. The presence of these three distinct cases aligns with the typological feature of having three cases.

**Reasoning**:
- Wintu has a nominative case for subjects.
- It has an accusative case for direct objects.
- It has a genitive case for possession.
- There are no additional cases for other syntactic or semantic roles that would increase the count beyond three.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",4 cases,3 cases
Acoma,"Acoma, also known as Keresan, is a language spoken by the Acoma Pueblo people in New Mexico. It belongs to the Keresan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Acoma does not employ a system of productive case paradigms for nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships.

Acoma uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This means that it does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language does not exhibit the kind of productive case paradigms that would be counted as having multiple cases.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Acoma in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"Aleut, a language of the Eskimo-Aleut family, exhibits a productive case system for its nouns. The language has a relatively rich morphological structure, including case marking. Aleut nouns are marked for several cases, which include:

3. **Genitive**: Used to indicate possession.
4. **Instrumental**: Used to indicate the means by which an action is performed.
5. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.
6. **Ablative**: Used to indicate movement away from something.
7. **Allative**: Used to indicate movement towards something.

Given this information, Aleut has a case system that includes at least seven distinct cases. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Aleut in terms of the number of cases is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",2 cases,6-7 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),"Chumash (Barbareño) is a member of the Chumashan language family, indigenous to the coastal regions of California. In examining the grammatical structure of Barbareño Chumash, it is important to note that this language does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do. Instead, Barbareño Chumash relies heavily on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

The language uses a combination of verbal morphology and word order to convey what might be expressed through case marking in other languages. For example, subject and object roles are typically indicated by their position relative to the verb rather than by inflectional endings on the nouns themselves. Additionally, Barbareño Chumash employs a rich system of verbal affixes to encode various grammatical relations and roles, further reducing the need for nominal case marking.

Given this reliance on syntactic and morphological strategies other than nominal case marking, Barbareño Chumash does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Comanche,"Comanche is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Comanche people in the United States. In terms of grammatical structure, Comanche is known for its polysynthetic nature, meaning that it often combines multiple morphemes into single words to express what would be entire sentences in other languages. 

Regarding case marking, Comanche does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. This means that the roles of subjects, objects, and other grammatical functions are typically inferred from the context provided by the verb and the overall sentence structure rather than through distinct case endings on nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Comanche uses verb morphology and word order rather than noun case endings to indicate grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Comanche.
   - The language does not employ overt marking for syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, or dative on nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",3 cases,no morphological case-marking
Kiowa,"Kiowa is a member of the Kiowa-Tanoan language family, primarily spoken by the Kiowa people in Oklahoma. In terms of its grammatical structure, Kiowa does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations within a sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Kiowa does not use inflectional morphemes to mark cases on nouns. Instead, it employs other grammatical strategies such as word order and verb agreement to convey syntactic roles. This is characteristic of languages that do not have a case system in the traditional sense.
   - **Verb Agreement:** Kiowa verbs are highly inflected and carry a significant amount of grammatical information, including subject and object agreement, which reduces the need for case marking on nouns.
   - **Word Order:** The language uses a relatively fixed word order to indicate grammatical relations, further diminishing the necessity for case marking.

Given these characteristics, Kiowa falls into the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"Yup'ik (Central) is a member of the Eskimo-Aleut language family and is known for its rich morphological system, including an extensive case system. The language features a variety of cases that mark different syntactic and semantic roles of nouns.

9. Terminalis

These cases cover a wide range of grammatical functions, from indicating the subject of an intransitive verb (absolutive) to marking the agent of a transitive verb (ergative), as well as various spatial and instrumental relations.

Given this extensive list of cases, Yup'ik (Central) clearly falls into the category of languages with ""10 or more cases.""

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Yurok,"Yurok, a language of the Algic family spoken in California, does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations. While Yurok does have some postpositions and other markers that can indicate relationships similar to those expressed by cases in other languages, these do not form a productive case paradigm for nouns.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Yurok does not exhibit a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
   - The language uses word order and syntactic constructions rather than inflectional morphology to indicate grammatical relations.
   - Any markers that do exist are more akin to postpositions and do not form a cohesive case system.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Zuni,"Zuni, a language spoken by the Zuni people in New Mexico, is known for its complex morphology, but it does not exhibit a productive case system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do. Instead, Zuni primarily uses postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. These postpositions serve functions similar to those of cases in other languages, such as indicating location, direction, and possession.

Given this information, Zuni does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositional phrases to convey meanings that other languages might express through case markings.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Columbia-Wenatchi, also known as Nxaʔamxčín, is a Salishan language spoken in the United States. Salishan languages are generally known for their polysynthetic nature and complex morphology, but they typically do not have extensive case systems like those found in Indo-European languages.

In Columbia-Wenatchi, grammatical relations are primarily indicated through word order, verb agreement, and the use of prepositions or postpositions rather than through a productive case system. While there may be some markers for specific roles or relations, these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of grammatical cases.

Given this understanding, Columbia-Wenatchi does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that would fit into the categories of 2 cases, 3 cases, etc. Instead, it relies on other grammatical mechanisms to indicate relationships between nouns and verbs.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tlingit,"Tlingit is a language spoken by the Tlingit people in Southeast Alaska and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Na-Dene language family. Tlingit is known for its complex verb morphology and relatively simple noun morphology. 

In terms of case marking, Tlingit does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Tsimshian (Coast) does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and particles, to convey these relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that would categorize Tsimshian (Coast) as having multiple cases.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) does not have a productive case system for nouns in the same way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, Nahuatl relies heavily on prepositions and possessive constructions to indicate relationships between nouns. The language uses a combination of prefixes, suffixes, and independent words to convey meanings that other languages might express through case inflections. 

In Nahuatl, the primary method of indicating grammatical relationships is through the use of relational nouns and postpositions rather than through a system of morphological case-marking. For example, possession is indicated by possessive prefixes, and locative meanings are often conveyed through relational nouns or postpositions.

Given this information, Nahuatl (Tetelcingo) does not have a productive case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language known for its complex phonology and relatively simple morphology. One of the notable features of Abkhaz is its lack of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead of using morphological case-marking, Abkhaz relies heavily on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations. 

In Abkhaz, the relationships between nouns and their roles in sentences are typically marked by prepositions and postpositions rather than by inflectional case endings. This characteristic aligns with the definition of ""No morphological case-marking"" provided in the context of this feature.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Inflectional Case Endings**: Abkhaz does not use inflectional endings on nouns to indicate grammatical case. Instead, it uses other syntactic strategies, such as word order and adpositions, to convey these relationships.
2. **Syntactic Means**: The language relies on syntactic means rather than morphological means to indicate grammatical relations, which is a key indicator of the absence of morphological case-marking.
3. **Typological Characteristics**: As a Northwest Caucasian language, Abkhaz shares this feature with other languages in the same family, which also tend to lack morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"Eastern Armenian, a branch of the Armenian language, exhibits a productive case system for nouns. The language has a well-defined set of morphological cases that are used to mark the grammatical functions of nouns within sentences. 

The cases in Eastern Armenian are as follows:

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Genitive (possession)
4. Dative (indirect object)
5. Ablative (source or separation)
6. Instrumental (means or instrument)
7. Locative (location)

These seven cases are used productively in the language to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles of nouns. Each case has distinct morphological markers that are applied to the noun to indicate its grammatical function.

**Reasoning:**
Eastern Armenian has a clear and productive system of case-marking with seven distinct cases. These cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic roles, including subject, direct object, possession, indirect object, source, means, and location. The presence of these cases indicates that Eastern Armenian has a rich morphological case system.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Basque,"Basque is known for its rich case system. It is an ergative-absolutive language, which means it marks the subject of an intransitive verb the same way as the object of a transitive verb (absolutive case), and the subject of a transitive verb differently (ergative case). In addition to these core cases, Basque has a variety of other cases to mark different syntactic and semantic roles.

The productive case paradigm in Basque includes the following cases:

1. Absolutive
2. Ergative
3. Dative
4. Genitive
5. Instrumental
6. Comitative
7. Benefactive
8. Locative (including several sub-cases like inessive, allative, ablative, etc.)

Given this extensive list, Basque clearly has more than 10 cases.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Catalan is a Romance language, closely related to Spanish, French, and Italian. Like these languages, Catalan has largely lost the productive case system that was present in Latin, from which it descends. Instead, Catalan relies primarily on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.

In Catalan, nouns do not inflect for case. Instead, the language uses prepositions to express relationships that other languages might express through case inflections. For example, the preposition ""de"" is used to indicate possession (similar to the genitive case in Latin), and ""a"" is used to indicate direction or indirect objects (similar to the dative case in Latin).

Given this information, Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Therefore, the appropriate option is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a language spoken in the Netherlands, exhibits a relatively simplified case system compared to many other Indo-European languages. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but over time, it has undergone significant simplification.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Context:** Old Frisian had a more extensive case system, similar to that of Old English and other Germanic languages. However, this system has largely been lost in modern Western Frisian.
   - **Current Usage:** In contemporary Western Frisian, there is no productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, syntactic roles are primarily indicated through word order and prepositions, much like in modern English.
   - **Noun Modifiers:** While there are remnants of case distinctions in pronouns and some fixed expressions, these do not constitute a productive case system for nouns. The genitive case, for example, is often replaced by prepositional phrases or possessive constructions.
   - **Linguistic Studies:** Various linguistic studies and descriptions of Western Frisian confirm the absence of a productive case system for nouns, aligning it more closely with languages that rely on word order and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Camsá,"Camsá, also known as Kamsá or Sibundoy, is a language spoken by the Camsá people in Colombia. It is known for its complex morphology, but it does not utilize a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, Camsá relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

In Camsá, there are no distinct morphological case markers that systematically apply to nouns to indicate their grammatical roles such as subject, object, or indirect object. This lack of productive case paradigms means that Camsá falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Absence of Case Paradigms**: Camsá does not have a set of morphological markers that apply to nouns to indicate different grammatical cases. This is a key characteristic of languages without morphological case-marking.
2. **Reliance on Syntax**: The language uses syntactic structures, such as word order, to convey grammatical relationships, rather than inflectional morphology.
3. **Typological Classification**: Based on typological studies and descriptions of Camsá, it is classified as a language that does not employ morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphological structure. However, it does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, Kadiwéu relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and verb agreement, to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences. This lack of productive case paradigms for nouns means that Kadiwéu does not fit into the categories of languages with 2 or more cases.

Given the definition of grammatical case and the specific criteria for counting cases, Kadiwéu falls into the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Karajá,"Karajá is a language spoken by the Karajá people in Brazil. It is a member of the Macro-Jê language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Karajá does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Karajá does not have a system of inflectional case markers that attach to nouns to indicate their grammatical roles (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.). Instead, the language uses other strategies, such as word order and context, to indicate these relationships.
   - **Linguistic Evidence:** Studies and descriptions of Karajá grammar, such as those by linguists who have worked on the language, consistently note the absence of a case-marking system. Instead, Karajá employs a relatively fixed word order and uses other syntactic and morphological means to convey meaning.

2. **Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"Baure is an Arawakan language spoken in Bolivia. In terms of its grammatical structure, Baure does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as word order and prepositions to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No morphological case-marking:** Baure does not have a system of inflectional morphemes attached to nouns to indicate grammatical cases. Instead, it uses other strategies like word order and prepositions to convey relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.
   - **Linguistic Evidence:** Studies and descriptions of Baure grammar, such as those by Danielsen (2007), indicate that the language lacks a morphological case system. Instead, Baure employs prepositions and postpositions to mark roles such as locative, instrumental, and other peripheral relations, which aligns with the feature of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
