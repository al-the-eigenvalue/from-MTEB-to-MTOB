Dyirbal,"Dyirbal is an Australian Aboriginal language known for its complex case system. The language exhibits a nominative-accusative alignment for pronouns and an ergative-absolutive alignment for nouns. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same way (absolutive), while the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (ergative).

Dyirbal has the following productive cases:
1. Absolutive (unmarked for intransitive subjects and transitive objects)
2. Ergative (marked for transitive subjects)
3. Dative (used for indirect objects and some other functions)
4. Genitive (used for possessive relationships)
5. Locative (used for location)
6. Instrumental (used for the means by which an action is performed)

Given this information, Dyirbal has a total of six productive cases.

Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia, exhibits a relatively simple case system compared to other languages with extensive case paradigms. In Amharic, case marking is not highly productive, and the language primarily relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. However, there are some morphological markers that can be considered as cases.

Amharic has a nominative case, which is the default form of the noun used for subjects. Additionally, it has an accusative case marked by the suffix ""-n"" for definite direct objects. There is also a genitive case, which is marked by the suffix ""-ä"" or ""-yä"" and is used to indicate possession. These three cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive) are the primary productive cases in Amharic.

Given this information, Amharic can be classified as having 3 cases.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Nominative Case:** The default form of the noun used for subjects.
2. **Accusative Case:** Marked by the suffix ""-n"" for definite direct objects.

   - Iraqw does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, the language uses other strategies such as word order, prepositions, and verb agreement to convey grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a systematic and productive set of case markers that would apply to nouns in a way that is characteristic of languages with morphological case-marking systems.
   - The language does not have overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations such as locatives or instrumentals in a consistent and productive manner.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda is a Bantu language spoken primarily in Rwanda. Bantu languages, in general, are known for their noun class systems rather than case systems. In Kinyarwanda, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and possessive are typically marked by prefixes and agreement markers rather than by inflectional case endings on nouns.

Kinyarwanda uses a system of noun classes, which are marked by prefixes that indicate various grammatical categories, including number and sometimes gender. These noun classes also trigger agreement in verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. However, this system does not constitute a case system in the traditional sense, where nouns change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence.

Given this information, Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns as described in the definition of grammatical case provided.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Seme,"To determine the number of cases in the language Seme, we need to examine the productive case paradigms of nouns in Seme. This involves identifying whether Seme uses morphological case-marking and, if so, how many distinct cases it employs.

1. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: This option would apply if Seme does not use any morphological markers to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

2. **2 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses two distinct morphological cases, such as nominative and accusative, to mark grammatical relationships.

3. **3 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses three distinct morphological cases, such as nominative, accusative, and genitive.

4. **4 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses four distinct morphological cases, such as nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative.

5. **5 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses five distinct morphological cases.

6. **6-7 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses between six and seven distinct morphological cases.

7. **8-9 Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses between eight and nine distinct morphological cases.

8. **10 or More Cases**: This would apply if Seme uses ten or more distinct morphological cases.

9. **Exclusively Borderline Case-Marking**: This would apply if Seme only uses overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, and not for core grammatical functions like subject or object.

Without specific information about the morphological case-marking system of Seme, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of cases. However, given the options provided and typical patterns in language typology, we can make an educated guess based on common linguistic features.

If Seme is a language with a relatively simple case system, it might fall into the categories of having 2, 3, or 4 cases. If it has a more complex system, it might fall into the categories of having 6-7, 8-9, or 10 or more cases. If it only marks peripheral relations, it would fall into the ""Exclusively Borderline Case-Marking"" category.

**Conclusion:** Without specific data on Seme, it is not possible to definitively determine the number of cases. However, based on common linguistic patterns, it is likely to fall into one of the categories mentioned above. For a precise determination, detailed linguistic analysis of Seme's case system is required.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"Koyra Chiini, also known as Western Songhay, is a language spoken primarily in Mali. It belongs to the Songhay language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Koyra Chiini does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to convey grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case inflections.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking:** Koyra Chiini does not have a system of inflectional morphology that marks nouns for different grammatical cases. Instead, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated through word order and the use of prepositions.
   - **Prepositional Phrases:** The language uses prepositional phrases to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental relations are expressed through prepositions rather than case endings.
   - **Typological Characteristics:** This feature aligns with the typological characteristics of many other languages in the region, which also tend to lack extensive case-marking systems.

Given these points, Koyra Chiini does not fit into any of the categories that involve multiple cases. Instead, it falls under the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines, does not have a traditional case system like those found in many Indo-European languages. Instead, it employs a system of focus or voice to indicate the syntactic role of noun phrases in a sentence. This system is often referred to as the ""Philippine-type voice system"" or ""focus system.""

In Tagalog, the focus system marks the relationship between the verb and the noun phrases, indicating which noun phrase is the topic or subject of the sentence. The language uses a set of particles (ang, ng, sa) to mark the syntactic roles of noun phrases, but these are not considered cases in the traditional sense. Instead, they function more like prepositions or markers of syntactic roles.

Given the definition of grammatical case provided, Tagalog does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The markers used in Tagalog do not fit the traditional definition of cases as they do not form a system of inflectional morphology for nouns. Instead, they are more akin to prepositions or syntactic markers.

Therefore, the most appropriate option for Tagalog is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it is known for its complex morphosyntactic structure. One of the notable features of Yimas is its lack of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead of using case markers on nouns to indicate grammatical relations, Yimas primarily relies on verb morphology and word order to convey these relationships.

In Yimas, the grammatical relations such as subject, object, and indirect object are indicated through pronominal affixes on the verb rather than through case marking on the nouns themselves. These pronominal affixes encode information about the person, number, and sometimes gender of the arguments. This means that the language does not use a system of morphological case-marking on nouns to indicate their syntactic roles.

Given this information, Yimas falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" because it does not have a productive system of case paradigms for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

### Reasoning:
1. **Case Marking in Aghu**: Aghu does not have a rich system of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, it primarily uses postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
2. **Peripheral Case Relations**: The language does have some markers for more concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locative or instrumental. These markers are not part of a productive case paradigm that applies broadly across different syntactic functions but are instead used for specific semantic roles.
3. **Absence of Core Case Marking**: The lack of morphological markers for core syntactic functions (such as subject or object) indicates that Aghu does not employ a traditional case system. Instead, it relies on word order and postpositions to convey these relationships.

Given these characteristics, Aghu fits the description of a language with ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is limited to specific, often peripheral, semantic roles rather than a comprehensive case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. It is a polysynthetic language, which means it tends to use complex words made up of many morphemes (the smallest units of meaning). In Oneida, grammatical relationships are primarily expressed through verb morphology rather than noun morphology. This means that the roles of nouns in sentences are usually indicated by the verb rather than by changes to the noun itself.

Oneida does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on verb affixes and word order to convey grammatical relationships. The language uses pronominal prefixes on verbs to indicate the subject and object, and it employs a variety of other verbal affixes to express additional grammatical information.

Given this information, Oneida falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking"" for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Catalan,"Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. This is characteristic of many Romance languages, which have largely lost the inflectional case systems of their Latin ancestor. In Catalan, the roles that would be marked by cases in other languages are typically expressed through prepositions (e.g., ""de"" for genitive, ""a"" for dative) and syntactic structure rather than morphological changes to the nouns themselves.

### Reasoning:
1. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: Catalan nouns do not change form to indicate different grammatical cases. Instead, prepositions and word order are used to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
2. **Romance Language Characteristics**: As a Romance language, Catalan has inherited the tendency from Latin to use prepositions rather than inflectional case endings. This is consistent with other Romance languages like Spanish, French, and Italian.
3. **Linguistic Evidence**: Studies and grammatical descriptions of Catalan consistently show that it lacks a productive case system for nouns, relying instead on syntactic and prepositional means to indicate grammatical relations.

Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, also known as West Frisian, is a Germanic language spoken in the Netherlands. In terms of morphological case-marking, Western Frisian has a very limited case system. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but modern Western Frisian has largely lost these inflections.

In contemporary Western Frisian, the primary case distinction that remains is between the nominative and the genitive. The genitive case is not highly productive and is mostly used in fixed expressions, possessive constructions, and some set phrases. The nominative case is the default form used for subjects. There is no distinct accusative or dative case marking on nouns; these roles are typically indicated by word order and prepositions.

Given this information, Western Frisian does not have a fully productive case system with multiple distinct cases for different grammatical roles. Instead, it has a very limited use of the genitive case, which does not extend to a broader, productive case paradigm.

**Reasoning:**
- Western Frisian historically had a more complex case system, but this has largely been lost in modern usage.
- The primary distinction that remains is between nominative and genitive, with the genitive being used in limited contexts.
- There is no distinct accusative or dative case marking on nouns, and these roles are indicated by word order and prepositions.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases

Kayah Li (Eastern),"Kayah Li (Eastern) is a language belonging to the Karenic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Kayah Li (Eastern), it is important to note that this language does not utilize a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, Kayah Li (Eastern) relies heavily on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Absence of Morphological Case-Marking:** Kayah Li (Eastern) does not exhibit morphological case-marking on nouns. This means that nouns do not change their form to indicate different grammatical roles such as subject, object, or possessive.
   - **Reliance on Word Order:** The language uses a relatively fixed word order to convey syntactic relationships. Typically, the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb, which is a common strategy in languages without case-marking.
   - **Use of Prepositions:** For roles that might be marked by cases in other languages, Kayah Li (Eastern) employs prepositions. For example, locative and instrumental roles are indicated by prepositions rather than by inflectional changes to the nouns themselves.

Given these characteristics, it is clear that Kayah Li (Eastern) does not have a productive case system.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Iquito,"Iquito is a highly endangered Zaparoan language spoken in Peru. In terms of its morphological structure, Iquito does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and adpositions, to indicate grammatical relations within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Analysis:** Iquito lacks a system of inflectional morphology that marks nouns for case. There are no suffixes, prefixes, or infixes that consistently alter the form of a noun to indicate its syntactic or semantic role within a sentence.
   - **Syntactic Structure:** The language primarily uses word order and adpositions to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This is a common feature in languages that do not have morphological case-marking.
   - **Linguistic Documentation:** Studies and linguistic descriptions of Iquito, such as those by Michael et al., indicate that the language does not employ a case system. Instead, it uses other strategies to manage grammatical relations.

Given these points, Iquito falls into the category of languages with no morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"Movima, a language spoken in Bolivia, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, Movima relies on other grammatical mechanisms such as word order and verbal morphology to indicate grammatical relations. This means that nouns in Movima are not inflected to show different cases like nominative, accusative, or genitive, which are common in languages with morphological case systems.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Inflectional Morphology for Nouns**: Movima does not use inflectional morphology to mark different grammatical cases on nouns. This is a key indicator that the language does not have a productive case system.
2. **Alternative Grammatical Mechanisms**: The language employs other strategies, such as word order and verbal affixes, to convey the roles of nouns in sentences. This is typical of languages without morphological case-marking.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Movima in linguistic literature consistently highlight the absence of a case-marking system, focusing instead on its reliance on syntactic and morphological strategies other than case inflection.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Apinayé,"Apinayé is a language spoken by the Apinayé people in Brazil, belonging to the Jê family of languages. In the context of grammatical case, Apinayé does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies, such as word order and the use of postpositions, to indicate grammatical relations within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking:** Apinayé does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change their form to indicate different grammatical roles such as subject, object, or indirect object.
   - **Alternative Strategies:** Instead of using morphological case, Apinayé employs word order and postpositions to convey grammatical relationships. This is a common feature in many languages that lack morphological case-marking.
   - **Typological Evidence:** Studies and descriptions of the Apinayé language, such as those by linguists specializing in Jê languages, confirm the absence of a productive case system. The language uses other means, such as syntactic constructions and postpositions, to fulfill the functions that cases would typically serve in other languages.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Cacua,"Cacua, a language spoken by the Cacua people in Colombia, is part of the Tucanoan language family. Tucanoan languages are generally known for their relatively simple morphological structures compared to languages with extensive case systems like Finnish or Russian.

In the case of Cacua, the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and postpositions, to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This is consistent with the general typological characteristics of many languages in the region, which tend to avoid extensive morphological case marking.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Cacua in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Yuracare,"Yuracare, a language spoken in Bolivia, does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate the roles of noun phrases in sentences. This characteristic aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: Yuracare does not exhibit a system of morphological case-marking where nouns change form to indicate their grammatical roles (such as nominative, accusative, etc.).
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: The language primarily uses word order and other syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships, rather than relying on inflectional morphology.
3. **Typological Data**: According to linguistic studies and typological surveys, Yuracare is categorized among languages that do not employ morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Camsá,"Camsá, also known as Kamëntsá, is a language spoken by the Kamëntsá people in Colombia. It is a language isolate, meaning it does not belong to any known language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Camsá does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Camsá does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change their form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and context, to convey these relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Camsá that would classify it under any of the categories with a specific number of cases.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphological structure. However, it does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, Kadiwéu relies more on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Kadiwéu does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. The language uses other means, such as word order and verbal morphology, to convey grammatical relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages. This absence of a productive case system aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Karajá,"Karajá is a language spoken by the Karajá people in Brazil. It is part of the Macro-Jê language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Karajá does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.
