Dyirbal,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dyirbal, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** provides a table (Table 3.1) listing the case inflections for nouns and adjectives, indicating that Dyirbal has nine cases: nominative, ergative, instrumental, simple genitive, locative, general genitive, dative, allative, and ablative.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** categorizes these nine cases into three groups: syntactic relations (nominative, ergative, instrumental, dative), genitives (simple and general), and motion-related cases (allative, locative, ablative).

3. **Paragraph 14** reiterates that Dyirbal has a full paradigm of case inflections, confirming the presence of these nine cases.

4. **Paragraph 19** further discusses the ablative case and its usage, reinforcing the presence of this case among the nine mentioned.

The information consistently points to Dyirbal having a productive case system with nine distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayardild,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kayardild, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the discussion of the case system for all nominal subclasses, indicating a rich case system.
2. **Paragraph 3** describes five types of functional domains for Kayardild case: adnominal, relational, modal, associating, and complementizing. It also mentions that nominals may take up to four cases in a specific order.
3. **Paragraph 6** provides a detailed list of case functions, including nominative, locative, ablative, allative, proprietive, instrumental, and several others, indicating a complex and extensive case system.
4. **Paragraph 10** mentions the use of nominal suffixes to indicate tense, aspect, and mood, further adding to the complexity of the case system.
5. **Paragraph 11** discusses the accumulation of up to four levels of case inflection on nouns.
6. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** provide additional examples of the various case functions and their uses, reinforcing the extensive nature of the case system.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Kayardild has a highly productive and complex case system with multiple layers of case marking. The language uses a variety of cases for different syntactic and semantic functions, including nominative, locative, ablative, allative, proprietive, instrumental, and others.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Malakmalak,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Malakmalak exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Benefactive suffix**: -no (Paragraph 19)
2. **Possessor suffix**: -no (Paragraph 19)
3. **Intentive suffix**: -no (Paragraph 19)
4. **Relator suffix**: -no (Paragraph 19)
5. **Comitative suffix**: -ye:n (Paragraph 19)
6. **Locative suffix**: -yinra (Paragraph 19)
7. **Agentive suffix**: -war (Paragraph 19)

These suffixes indicate that Malakmalak has a system of case marking, primarily for peripheral or semantic relations such as benefactive, possessor, intentive, relator, comitative, locative, and agentive. However, there is no indication of core syntactic cases like nominative or accusative being marked morphologically.

Given that the cases identified are primarily for peripheral relations and there is no evidence of core syntactic case marking, the most appropriate classification for Malakmalak would be:

**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

### Reasoning:
- The identified cases (benefactive, possessor, intentive, relator, comitative, locative, agentive) are all peripheral or semantic cases.
- There is no evidence of core syntactic cases (nominative, accusative, etc.) being marked morphologically.
- The case system is thus limited to marking specific semantic roles rather than core grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Mangarrayi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Mangarrayi exhibits a productive case system for nouns. Here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions several case functions including dative, purposive, instrumental, locative, allative, genitive, and ablative.
2. **Paragraph 3** confirms the presence of subject, object, dative, genitive, and local case forms in pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 6** further elaborates on the case functions, specifying genitive, dative, purposive, and local cases, and mentions that instrumental case is distinct for neuter nouns.
4. **Paragraph 10** discusses the paradigms for syntactic and instrumental functions, and mentions that other case functions are expressed by combinations of prefix and suffix.
5. **Paragraph 13** describes the dative/purposive nominal case-ending and its use in genitive and purposive functions.
6. **Paragraph 16** discusses the genitive case and its use in expressing possession and part-whole relations.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following distinct cases:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Dative
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Locative
- Allative
- Ablative
- Purposive

This gives us a total of at least 9 distinct cases. Given the range of cases mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that Mangarrayi has a productive case system with 8-9 cases.

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Maranungku,"To determine the number of cases in Maranungku, we need to look for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. This involves identifying distinct morphological markers that indicate different grammatical functions such as nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc.

From the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the indirect object being represented twice, once as a noun and once as a pronoun, but does not provide explicit case markers.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses class markers for nouns but does not mention case markers.
3. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 10** discuss pronouns and their forms but do not provide evidence of noun case marking.
4. **Paragraph 8** mentions cause being expressed by nouns followed by specific constructions, but this does not indicate case marking.
5. **Paragraph 9** mentions locative phrases but does not indicate that these are marked by case on the noun.
6. **Paragraph 19** discusses benefactive forms for pronouns but does not provide evidence of case marking on nouns.
7. **Paragraph 20** mentions the direct object following the noun subject but does not indicate case marking.

From the information provided, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Maranungku. The descriptions focus on pronouns and their forms, as well as noun classes and their markers, but do not indicate distinct morphological case markers for nouns.

**Reasoning:**
- No explicit mention of morphological case markers for nouns.
- Focus on pronouns and their forms rather than noun case paradigms.
- Descriptions of noun classes and locative phrases do not indicate case marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tiwi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 4** explicitly states: ""There is no case in Tiwi and the pronouns are used without inflexion in syntactic position -- e.g., as subject intransitive, subject transitive, object possessor.""

2. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 10** discuss various grammatical aspects of Tiwi, including subject prefixes, tense markers, and verb morphology, but do not mention any case inflections for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 16** describe noun classes and gender distinctions, but again, there is no mention of case inflections for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss morphophonological processes and verb morphophonology, respectively, without reference to noun case marking.

5. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** describe verb phrases and object prefixes, indicating that grammatical relationships are expressed through verb morphology rather than noun case inflections.

6. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** discuss plural forms and collective pronouns, respectively, but do not indicate any case marking for nouns.

7. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** describe nominal morphophonology and kinship terms, again without reference to case marking.

8. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 11** discuss sentence structure and the expression of structural relations, emphasizing word order and context rather than case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit statement in Paragraph 4 and the absence of any mention of case inflections in the other paragraphs, it is clear that Tiwi does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system of Ungarinjin as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions two distinct cases marked by ""ra"": a locative and an instrumental agentive, the latter occurring only on pronouns and proper nouns.
2. **Paragraph 3** distinguishes between grammatical and non-grammatical cases, with grammatical case relations signaled by cross-reference on the verb, and non-grammatical cases signaled mainly by nominal postpositions.
3. **Paragraph 4** describes a postposition ""-gu"" serving some functions associated with the dative case.
4. **Paragraph 11** states that nominal postpositions in Ungarinjin do not normally indicate grammatical case relations, and noun phrases cross-referenced on the verb do not ordinarily bear case postpositions.
5. **Paragraph 18** discusses the use of the nominal postposition ""-gu"" in adverbial clauses, indicating an adverbial case postposition.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Ungarinjin has a system where grammatical case relations are primarily indicated by verb cross-referencing rather than nominal case marking. The nominal postpositions mentioned (locative, instrumental agentive, and dative) are used for specific semantic roles rather than grammatical relations.

Given this information, Ungarinjin does not have a productive case paradigm for grammatical relations but uses postpositions for specific semantic roles. This fits the description of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wambaya,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in the Wambaya language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Core Cases**: The language has three core cases: nominative, accusative, and ergative/locative. The nominative and accusative are marked by zero suffixes, while the ergative/locative is marked by -yi, -ni, -nu, or -ji depending on the environment.
2. **Dative Case**: The dative case is marked by -ja, -janka, -nka, or -ngga.
3. **Allative Case**: The allative case is marked by -nmanji.
4. **Ablative Case**: The ablative case is marked by -ngani or -nnga.
5. **Comitative Case**: The comitative case is marked by -mbili.
6. **Perlative Case**: The perlative case is marked by -nkanyi or -nmarndi.
7. **Causal Case**: The causal case is marked by -nigan.
8. **Genitive Case**: The genitive case is marked by -nugan, -nagan, -uj, or -aja.
9. **Proprietive Case**: The proprietive case is marked by -nguj or -aja.
10. **Privative Case**: The privative case is marked by -yaja or -waja.
11. **Origin Case**: The origin case is marked by -inv.

From the information provided, Wambaya has a productive case system with at least 11 distinct cases: nominative, accusative, ergative/locative, dative, allative, ablative, comitative, perlative, causal, genitive, proprietive, privative, and origin.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amharic, we can derive the following information regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses possessive structures and how possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate possession. This suggests a genitive-like construction but does not explicitly mention a genitive case.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Talks about the verbal noun and its usage as a subject or direct object, taking articles and possessive suffix pronouns. This indicates that nouns can be marked for possession and possibly for subject and object roles, but it does not explicitly mention case marking.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Provides examples of verbal nouns and their usage, including possessive suffix pronouns. It also mentions that verbal nouns are not used with object suffix pronouns and are not pluralized, indicating a distinction in noun forms but not necessarily a case system.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the endings -t and -w, which might be interpreted as markers of the direct object or articles, but concludes that these endings are stylistic rather than grammatical, suggesting that these are not productive case markers.

5. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of adjectives and relative qualifiers, indicating that adjectives can take articles and direct object markers, but does not explicitly mention a case system.

6. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses conjunctions and their usage with different verb forms, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 10**: Explains how qualified nouns are referred to by object suffix pronouns in relative clauses, suggesting a syntactic rather than morphological approach to marking grammatical relations.

8. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions a work on Amharic case grammar, indicating that there is some discussion of case in the literature, but does not provide details.

9. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses indefinite pronouns and their usage, indicating syntactic structures but not morphological case marking.

10. **Paragraph 13**: Provides examples of adjective+noun complexes and their determination by articles and direct object markers, suggesting syntactic marking rather than a productive case system.

11. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the meanings of verbal nouns with suffix pronouns, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

12. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions differential meanings in verbs but does not discuss case marking.

13. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses possessive structures with prepositions, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

14. **Paragraph 17**: Talks about object suffix pronouns and their usage, indicating syntactic marking rather than a productive case system.

15. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses verb forms and their conjugation, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

16. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of denominative verbs, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

17. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses gender specifiers and their usage, indicating syntactic relationships but not morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, Amharic does not exhibit a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on syntactic structures, possessive suffix pronouns, and articles to indicate grammatical relationships. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Amharic is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Beja,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Beja, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 3** explicitly mentions that ""Two cases are distinguished in the noun-phrase: nominative and accusative,"" and further explains their functions and formal distinctions.
2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of nominative and accusative forms, reinforcing the presence of these two cases.
3. **Paragraph 17** discusses the structure of the noun-phrase and mentions the concord of number, gender, and case, but does not introduce any additional cases beyond nominative and accusative.
4. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 7** discuss possessive constructions and postpositions, but these do not introduce new cases; rather, they describe how possessive and adverbial functions are marked.

Given this information, it is clear that Beja has a productive case paradigm with two distinct cases: nominative and accusative.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar explicitly identifies and provides examples of only two cases: nominative and accusative.
- There is no mention of additional cases beyond these two in the provided paragraphs.
- Possessive and adverbial functions are handled through other grammatical means, not additional cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Middle Atlas Berber, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses possessive pronouns and their usage with kinship nouns, as well as prepositions. This indicates the presence of possessive constructions but does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions directional or locative information expressed by indices (d and n) used with verbs, behaving like object pronouns. This suggests some form of locative marking but does not indicate a full-fledged case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 5**: Talks about pronouns used after prepositions and possessive pronouns, indicating a close relationship between these forms. This again points to possessive and prepositional constructions rather than a productive case system.

4. **Paragraph 9**: Describes the use of pronouns with kinship nouns and possessive pronouns, including peculiarities in plural forms. This reinforces the idea of possessive constructions but does not indicate a case system.

5. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses demonstrative bases and noun complements, indicating agreement with the complement noun. This suggests some form of syntactic agreement but not necessarily a case system.

6. **Paragraph 19**: Describes pronominalization in verbal sentences, including the use of subject affixes and object pronouns. This indicates a reliance on pronominal forms rather than case marking for grammatical relations.

7. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions the use of the preposition n 'of' with nouns, indicating possessive constructions and the formation of ordinal numbers. This suggests the use of prepositions for relational marking rather than a case system.

From the analysis, it is clear that Middle Atlas Berber uses possessive pronouns, prepositions, and pronominal forms to mark grammatical relations, but there is no evidence of a productive case system for nouns. The language relies on other means such as prepositions and pronominal affixes to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Diola-Fogny,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Diola-Fogny, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Noun Class Markers and Concord**: Diola-Fogny has an extensive system of noun class markers that define various categories such as number, personal vs. impersonal, and relative size. These markers are integral to the concord system, which involves agreement between nouns and other elements like verbs and adjectives.

2. **Genitive Phrases**: The language uses genitive particles to introduce possessive relationships. These particles can introduce any type of noun or seminominal phrase, and possessive phrases often involve bound person markers.

3. **Relational Particles and Prepositions**: Noun phrases and seminominals can be preceded by relational particles, resulting in prepositional phrases indicating proximity, similarity, and other relationships.

4. **Suffixes and Derivatives**: Nouns can take definite articles and possessive suffixes, which are part of the concord system. There are also derivative suffixes that modify themes to form nouns or verbs.

5. **No Explicit Mention of Traditional Case Paradigms**: The text does not provide evidence of a traditional case system (e.g., nominative, accusative, dative) that marks syntactic roles directly on nouns through inflectional case endings.

6. **Use of Prepositions and Relational Particles**: Instead of inflectional case marking, Diola-Fogny uses prepositions and relational particles to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

Given these observations, Diola-Fogny does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on a complex system of noun class markers, concord, and relational particles to convey grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Gimira,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, we can analyze the case system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that case is marked by suffixes added to the final element of the noun phrase or the penultimate element when a final quantifier is present.
2. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of different cases:
   - Nominative
   - Accusative
   - Genitive
   - Dative/Benefactive
   - Locative
   - Ablative

3. **Paragraph 5** indicates that nominative and accusative suffixes are obligatory when the noun is specific and optional when the noun is not specific.
4. **Paragraph 6** mentions the oblique case form, which functions as an object, a possessive pronoun, and in adverbial cases.
5. **Paragraph 9** lists additional suffixes that may replace the nominative or accusative case marker or be added to the locative or ablative suffix.
6. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of the reflexive pronoun and its usage in sentences.

From the information provided, we can identify at least six distinct cases in Gimira:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative/Benefactive
- Locative
- Ablative

Given the explicit mention of these six cases and the possibility of additional suffixes that may replace or be added to these cases, it is reasonable to conclude that Gimira has a productive case system with at least six cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Grebo, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, the language appears to use postpositions and other syntactic means to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. Here is the reasoning for this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions postpositions occurring after nouns and object pronouns, indicating that relational meanings are expressed through postpositions rather than case inflections.
2. **Paragraph 9** discusses postpositions and their syntactic distribution, further supporting the use of postpositions instead of case markings.
3. **Paragraph 13** describes possessive pronouns and their use with nouns, but there is no mention of case inflections.
4. **Paragraph 19** mentions phrases consisting of possessive pronouns and nouns, again without reference to case markings.
5. **Paragraph 20** discusses verb tense suffixes and their interaction with noun tones, but does not mention case inflections.

Given the consistent use of postpositions and the absence of any mention of case inflections in the provided paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that Grebo does not employ a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that relations such as subject, object, and genitive are expressed by word order and tone rather than by morphological case-marking. Specifically, it states that the genitival relationship is expressed by post-position and a special tone pattern rather than by inflectional case endings.

2. **Paragraph 2** reinforces the idea that secondary grammatical categories like case are expressed differently in Igbo, if at all. It emphasizes that person and number are expressed by pronoun sequence, and gender is not grammatically expressed.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the tonal expression of subject and object relationships, indicating that these grammatical relations are marked tonally rather than morphologically.

4. **Paragraph 4** further elaborates on the genitival relationship, explaining that it is marked by a particular tonal pattern in the pre-genitival noun, rather than by a morphological case marker.

5. **Paragraph 5** states that verbs are the only part of speech with an inflectional affix (a vowel prefix), and all other inflection in the language, including that of nouns, is expressed tonally or suprasegmentally.

6. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of grammatical relationships of nouns, such as genitive, subject, object, and post-prepositional, all of which are expressed by word order and tone rather than by morphological case markers.

7. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** continue to emphasize that grammatical relations in Igbo are expressed by tone and word order, not by morphological case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss the tonal behavior of nouns in various grammatical relationships, again indicating that these relationships are marked tonally rather than morphologically.

9. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 12** further illustrate the use of tone to express grammatical relations, including genitival relationships and subject-object distinctions.

10. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 14** provide additional examples of how tone and word order are used to express grammatical relationships, reinforcing the absence of morphological case-marking.

11. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the role of tone in distinguishing grammatical relations and verb forms, again indicating that these are not marked by morphological case endings.

12. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** provide more examples of tonal marking of grammatical relations, including genitival relationships and subject-object distinctions.

13. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** summarize the overall grammatical system of Igbo, emphasizing that grammatical relations are expressed by tone and word order, with only the verb having a segmental inflectional prefix.

Based on this analysis, it is clear that Igbo does not use morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, grammatical relations are expressed through word order and tonal patterns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can analyze the presence and types of case markings in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Case Clitics**:
   - Paragraphs mention various case clitics such as directive (-i), ablative (-wa), instrumental (-ar), and reason (-sa). These clitics are attached to nouns, pronouns, and sometimes verbs to indicate different grammatical relations.
   - Examples include:
     - ""kuung-i"" (to you)
     - ""kuung-wameetin"" (He avoids you)
     - ""in oskwe-'een-ardoohl"" (He is digging with mine)
     - ""aten at o-ka-sada>eemiit-aan"" (We are afraid of a certain one)
     - ""an-at i-da-wameet-iim"" (I avoid that one)

2. **Construct Case**:
   - The construct case is mentioned multiple times, indicating a specific form used when a noun is followed by a modifier (e.g., another noun, adjective, or relative clause).
   - Examples include:
     - ""tsaxwehi dangw"" (elephant trap)
     - ""kurku cisa>"" (last year)
     - ""waahlar ur"" (a big python)
     - ""dicita cawak"" (cream)
     - ""gi'a heeda>"" (the ghost of that man)

3. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The language uses productive case paradigms for various grammatical functions, including locative expressions, instrumental uses, and reasons for actions.
   - Examples include:
     - ""buura a-nsum-1n"" (We put poison into the beer)
     - ""hikwa- kad6ohlLS G :S.l/2 hand:Ml-l .SG.POSS-INSTR dig:l .SG"" (I dig with my hand)
     - ""buura a-ndakw->een-aran aqa-qeerxats-ta-ka-r-waS.3 in:CON valley-Fl-INDEF.F-F-ABL HAB-graze:3.SG.F"" (It usually grazes in a certain valley)

4. **Adverbial Role Case Clitics**:
   - The language employs adverbial role case clitics that can be attached to nouns, pronouns, and verbs to indicate various roles such as direction, location, instrument, and reason.
   - Examples include:
     - ""di-r-6k-i"" (from me)
     - ""dir6 gi"" (from my place)
     - ""di-r-'ee>-wa"" (from me)
     - ""dir' eewa"" (from my place)

5. **No Mention of Nominative or Accusative**:
   - There is no explicit mention of nominative or accusative cases, which are typically used to mark subjects and direct objects in many languages with case systems.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Iraqw exhibits productive case paradigms primarily for peripheral or semantic relations such as locative, instrumental, and reason. There is no evidence of a full-fledged nominative-accusative system, but rather a focus on marking specific semantic roles.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Kinyarwanda does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, the language relies heavily on other grammatical mechanisms such as verb morphology, prepositions, and word order to indicate grammatical relations. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions benefactive markers and the presence of a benefactive NP, but it does not indicate a case system for marking these roles on nouns themselves.
2. **Paragraph 5** discusses possessive and genitive constructions, indicating that possession is marked by a morpheme or by nothing, rather than by a distinct case paradigm.
3. **Paragraph 6** describes locative marking and the use of suffixes to indicate locative roles, but this is more indicative of locative constructions rather than a full-fledged case system.
4. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 15** mention benefactive and instrumental roles, respectively, but again, these are marked by verb morphology or prepositions rather than by noun case endings.
5. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 17** discuss pronoun incorporation and reflexive pronouns, indicating that grammatical relations are often marked on the verb or through pronouns rather than through noun case endings.

Given the evidence, Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it uses other grammatical strategies to indicate relationships between nouns and verbs.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, the following points are clear:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Explicitly states, ""There are no cases.""
2. **Paragraph 3**: Reiterates, ""Koromfe has no case marking anywhere.""
3. **Paragraph 4**: Confirms, ""There is no case in Koromfe.""
4. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions, ""Koromfe has no cases, therefore there is no double case marking as such.""
5. **Paragraph 9**: States, ""Koromfe has no cases and no other grammatical categories are marked in the interrogative pronouns.""
6. **Paragraph 11**: Reiterates, ""Case is not marked at all in Koromfe.""
7. **Paragraph 16**: Confirms, ""Koromfe has no cases, therefore § 1.2.4.4 is inapplicable.""

These paragraphs consistently indicate that Koromfe does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. There is no mention of any productive case paradigms, and the language lacks any form of case marking, including for peripheral or semantic relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lango,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lango, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states: ""Nouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord class."" This indicates that Lango does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 8** reiterates that ""Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (à la Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles."" This further confirms the absence of morphological case-marking.

3. **Paragraph 17** discusses the order of elements within a sentence and mentions that ""Verbs are both inflected for DO (but not necessarily when followed by a DO NP) and marked for transitivity."" This suggests that grammatical roles are indicated through word order and verb inflections rather than noun case markings.

4. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 16** discuss various verb forms and their inflections, but there is no mention of noun case marking. Instead, the language relies on verb conjugations and word order to convey grammatical relationships.

5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 14** discuss associative constructions and the use of possessive suffixes, but these do not constitute a case system as defined in the context of productive case paradigms for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** discuss the use of determiners and quantifiers within noun phrases, again without reference to case marking.

Given the consistent information across multiple paragraphs that nouns in Lango are not marked for case, it is clear that Lango does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

10. **Paragraph 10** mentions accusative and nominative cases.
11. **Paragraph 11** discusses nominative cases.
12. **Paragraph 12** mentions dative cases.
13. **Paragraph 13** lists nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses genitive and dative cases.
15. **Paragraph 15** does not provide new information about cases.
16. **Paragraph 16** does not provide new information about cases.
17. **Paragraph 17** does not provide new information about cases.
18. **Paragraph 18** does not provide new information about cases.
19. **Paragraph 19** does not provide new information about cases.
20. **Paragraph 20** does not provide new information about cases.

From the information provided, we can identify the following cases in Murle:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Locative/Instrumental

This gives us a total of 5 distinct cases.

**Reasoning:**
The descriptive grammar paragraphs indicate the presence of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative/instrumental cases. These cases are mentioned multiple times across different paragraphs, confirming their productivity and relevance in the language's case system.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Nama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nama, the language exhibits the following characteristics relevant to case marking:

1. **Subordinative Suffix -a**: Paragraphs 3 and 19 discuss the subordinative suffix -a, which is used to mark noun phrases of subordinate status in the sentence. This suffix is described as a ""case"" suffix, analogous to case morphemes in other languages. The presence of this suffix indicates that Nama has at least one productive case marker.

2. **Agentive Case**: Paragraph 19 mentions remnants of an ""agentive case"" marked by -i in certain fixed expressions. Although this is not a fully productive case, it suggests some historical case marking.

3. **Productive Case Paradigm**: The subordinative suffix -a is the only productive case morpheme mentioned, and it is used in various constructions, such as equational predicates, direct or indirect objects, temporal phrases, and more. This indicates that Nama primarily uses this single case marker in a productive manner.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**: The discussion of the subordinative suffix -a and the agentive case -i suggests that Nama does not have a rich system of morphological case marking. Instead, it relies on a single productive case marker and remnants of another, which aligns more with a borderline case-marking system.

Given these observations, Nama does not exhibit a complex system of multiple productive case paradigms. Instead, it has a single productive case marker (the subordinative suffix -a) and remnants of another (the agentive case -i), which fits the description of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the following observations can be made regarding case-marking:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses subject and object pronouns, which are cliticized to the verb stem. This indicates a syntactic strategy rather than morphological case-marking.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions postpositions and their use with nominal elements, indicating that relational roles are marked by postpositions rather than morphological cases.

3. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses possessive pronouns and their use with kinship terms and inalienable nouns, showing that possession is marked by pronouns rather than morphological cases.

4. **Paragraph 8**: Provides examples of postpositional phrases and their nominalization, further indicating the use of postpositions for relational roles.

5. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the use of the word ""idza"" (house) as both a noun and a locative modifier, again suggesting the use of locative postpositions rather than morphological cases.

6. **Paragraph 17**: Describes the postposition ""bhéyi"" and its modification by personal pronouns, indicating that relational roles are marked by postpositions.

7. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the resumptive marker and its use with pronouns and demonstratives, which does not indicate morphological case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions that plurality is sometimes shown in the verb, indicating that number marking is done on the verb rather than through morphological cases on nouns.

9. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses logophoric pronouns and their use in indirect speech, which is a syntactic strategy rather than morphological case-marking.

From these observations, it is clear that Ngiti uses postpositions and clitics to indicate relational roles and possession, rather than employing a productive morphological case system for nouns.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Oromo (Harar),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Oromo (Harar) exhibits the following cases:

1. **Nominative**: This is mentioned multiple times, indicating its presence as a productive case.
2. **Absolutive**: Also frequently mentioned, suggesting it is another productive case.
3. **Genitive**: Explicitly mentioned in the context of possessive constructions.
4. **Dative**: Mentioned in the context of noun and verb agreement.
5. **Locative**: Mentioned as a case, indicating spatial relations.
6. **Instrumental**: Mentioned as a case, indicating the means by which an action is performed.

Given the explicit mention of these six cases, it is clear that Oromo (Harar) has a productive case system with at least six cases.

**Reasoning**:
- Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 explicitly mention nominative, absolutive, genitive, dative, locative, and instrumental cases.
- These cases are used in various grammatical constructions, indicating their productivity.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Sango,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sango, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The paragraphs mention various uses of pronouns, noun phrases, and prepositions (e.g., ""na"" translated as 'to', 'for', 'of', or 'from'), but there is no indication of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves. The references to ""cases"" in the text appear to be discussing instances or examples rather than grammatical cases.

Here is the reasoning for each relevant paragraph:

- **Paragraph 2**: Mentions subjective and objective relationships, as well as expressions of place or time, but does not indicate morphological case-marking on nouns.
- **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the use of ""ti"" phrases to indicate possession, equation, attribution, destination, location, time, etc., but these are prepositional phrases, not morphological cases.
- **Paragraph 16**: Mentions the translation of ""na"" as 'to', 'for', 'of', or 'from', indicating the use of prepositions rather than morphological case-marking.
- **Paragraph 18**: Mentions the subject marker ""a-"", but this is related to verb agreement rather than noun case-marking.

Given the absence of evidence for morphological case-marking on nouns in the provided text, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Supyire as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** discuss peripheral case roles such as benefactive, associative, instrumental, and manner. These roles are marked by postpositions or preposition-postposition pairs rather than by inflectional morphology on the nouns themselves. For example, the benefactive role is marked by the dative postposition ""ä"" and the associative/instrumental by ""ui...nä"".

2. **Paragraph 4** states that Supyire pronouns are not sensitive to case, with the same form used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and possessor. This indicates a lack of morphological case-marking on pronouns.

3. **Paragraph 5** mentions that Supyire does not extensively use serial verbs as case markers, which implies that case marking is not a primary function of serial verbs in this language.

4. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that peripheral case roles are marked by adpositions or as direct objects of serial verbs, further supporting the use of adpositions rather than morphological case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** provide additional context on the structure of clauses and noun phrases, indicating that roles such as locative or dative are expressed through adpositional phrases rather than morphological case inflections.

6. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 17** discuss the use of postpositions for marking oblique cases, again emphasizing the role of adpositions rather than morphological case-marking.

7. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** describe genitive constructions and the use of possessive pronouns, which are marked by tonal changes rather than morphological case endings.

From these observations, it is clear that Supyire primarily uses adpositions to mark various grammatical roles, including peripheral cases, rather than employing a productive morphological case system on nouns. The evidence points towards the use of adpositions for specific roles like benefactive, associative, instrumental, and locative, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yoruba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yoruba, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses the nature of pronouns and nouns in Yoruba, indicating that pronouns are not distinctly different from nouns in their syntactic behavior. This suggests that there is no special morphological case marking for pronouns that would indicate a separate case system.

2. **Paragraph 2** mentions genitival qualifiers and polymorphic nouns but does not indicate any morphological case marking for these nouns. The genitival relationship is expressed through word order and possessive constructions rather than through inflectional case endings.

3. **Paragraph 3** discusses genitival head nouns and provides examples of genitival phrases. Again, the genitival relationship is indicated by word order and possessive constructions, not by morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 5** describes the behavior of the second person plural noun and the third person singular object noun, but there is no mention of morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss the use of introducers for verbs and modifiers, as well as the use of verb phrases as nouns, but do not indicate any morphological case marking for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss the use of prepositions and the classification of nouns, but there is no mention of morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 15** mentions that most nouns can function as subjects and objects, but does not indicate any morphological case marking for these functions.

8. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the use of introducers for marking elements as nouns, but do not indicate any morphological case marking.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Yoruba does not employ a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, relationships such as possession and syntactic roles (subject, object) are indicated through word order, prepositions, and possessive constructions rather than through inflectional case endings.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Jamsay,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Jamsay. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the postposition ""le$"", which serves multiple grammatical functions such as locative, instrumental, and dative. This indicates that Jamsay uses postpositions to mark certain grammatical relations rather than inflectional case markings on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 9**: Provides examples of the use of ""le$"" in various contexts, reinforcing that locative, instrumental, and dative relations are marked by postpositions rather than case inflections on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions that Jamsay makes use of postpositions for dative and spatiotemporal cases, and that these postpositions can be extended by adding quantifiers or particles. This further supports the use of postpositions instead of morphological case markings.

4. **Paragraph 16**: Describes the nominal suffixes for human nouns (-n for singular and -m for plural) but does not mention any case inflections. This suggests that number is marked morphologically, but case is not.

5. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses tonal locatives, which are formed by adding a tone to the end of a noun stem to indicate location. This is another example of using tonal changes and postpositions rather than morphological case markings.

6. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions reflexive and logophoric pronouns, which are morphologically nouns rather than pronouns and can be followed by regular nominal postpositions. This indicates that even reflexive and logophoric functions are handled by postpositions rather than case inflections.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The evidence suggests that Jamsay does not use productive morphological case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions and tonal changes to mark grammatical relations such as locative, instrumental, and dative. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Jamsay is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Ik,"### Reasoning:

**Conclusion: 8-9 cases**",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Pronouns and Case Marking**:
   - Emai pronouns reflect case distinctions such as nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive (Paragraph 1, 5.1 Definite personal pronouns).
   - The pronouns exhibit different forms for these cases, indicating a productive case system for pronouns.

2. **Noun Modifiers and Case Relations**:
   - The language uses various particles and markers to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence, such as the Relator particle ""li"" (Paragraph 1, 4.3.3.3.1 Marked attributive li).
   - These markers are used to express attributes, possession, and other relationships, but they do not constitute a full-fledged case system for nouns.

3. **Absence of Morphological Case Marking on Nouns**:
   - There is no evidence of morphological case marking on nouns themselves. Instead, relationships are often indicated through word order, particles, and prepositions (Paragraph 1, 4.3.3.3.1 Marked attributive li; Paragraph 1, 5.4 Bound pronouns).

4. **Genitive and Possession**:
   - The genitive case is marked by associative phrases (ísì) rather than morphological changes to the noun (Paragraph 1, 4.3.3.3.1 Marked attributive li).

5. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The presence of distinct pronoun forms for different cases suggests a productive case paradigm for pronouns, but this does not extend to nouns.

6. **Summary of Evidence**:
   - The language exhibits case distinctions in pronouns but not in nouns. The relationships involving nouns are expressed through particles, prepositions, and word order rather than morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Emai does not exhibit a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on particles, prepositions, and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Emai is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The examples and descriptions focus on the use of determiners, pronouns, and possessive constructions, but there is no mention of specific morphological case markers that would indicate a system of grammatical cases for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses an idiomatic expression and the use of demonstratives, but does not mention case marking.
2. **Paragraph 2** describes a specific syntactic construction involving a noun phrase subject, but again, there is no mention of morphological case marking.
3. **Paragraph 3** focuses on the structure of noun phrases and the use of numerals, without reference to case marking.
4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of determiners and specific noun phrases, but does not indicate any case marking.
5. **Paragraph 5** mentions possession and the use of possessive markers, but these are not indicative of a broader case system.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses pluralization of pronouns and the use of specific pronouns, without reference to case marking.
7. **Paragraph 7** describes possessive constructions and the use of determiners, without mentioning case marking.
8. **Paragraph 8** focuses on the interpretation of verbs and adverbials, with no reference to case marking.
9. **Paragraph 9** discusses thematic roles and detransitivization, but does not mention case marking.
10. **Paragraph 10** describes the use of adverbials and determiners, without reference to case marking.
11. **Paragraph 11** discusses the use of determiners and the structure of noun phrases, without mentioning case marking.
12. **Paragraph 12** differentiates between possessive and grammatical uses of ""ni,"" but does not indicate a case system.
13. **Paragraph 13** discusses verb suffixes and subordinate clauses, without reference to case marking.
14. **Paragraph 14** provides evidence for pronominal subjects in nonverbal predicates, but does not mention case marking.
15. **Paragraph 15** describes the structure of arguments and the use of pronominals, without reference to case marking.
16. **Paragraph 16** discusses the interpretation of determiners and postmodifiers, without mentioning case marking.
17. **Paragraph 17** describes cognate object structures and their characteristics, without reference to case marking.
18. **Paragraph 18** discusses focus constructions and the use of determiners, without mentioning case marking.
19. **Paragraph 19** describes the use of headless relatives and adverbials, without reference to case marking.
20. **Paragraph 20** discusses the use of demonstratives and plural markers, without mentioning case marking.

Given the absence of explicit mention of morphological case marking in these paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that Ma'di does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs, here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases in the language Seme:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses pronouns and their forms, indicating that pronouns do not inflect for grammatical function. The same form is used in subject, object, and postpositional object positions. This suggests a lack of case marking for pronouns.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions the structure of the nominal projection, including a noun taking an optional ""kase phrase (KP)"" complement, which is a possessor. This indicates some form of possessive marking, but it is not clear if this extends to a full case system.

3. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses pronouns again, noting that the third person singular pronoun also functions as a definite particle. This reinforces the idea that pronouns do not have distinct forms for different grammatical functions.

4. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions the English genitive suffix 's and its various meanings. This is relevant for understanding possessive constructions but does not provide direct evidence about the case system in Seme.

5. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses the abstract meaning of a morpheme and its various uses, including possessive constructions. This suggests that possessive marking might be present but does not confirm a full case system.

6. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses possessives preceding the noun they modify in Kru languages, which might be relevant if Seme is related to these languages. However, this does not provide direct evidence of a case system.

7. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses the use of a morpheme to mark past tense in combination with grammatical aspects, but this is not directly relevant to case marking.

From the information provided, it appears that Seme has some form of possessive marking but lacks a full productive case paradigm for nouns. The evidence suggests that pronouns do not inflect for grammatical function, and there is no clear indication of multiple cases being marked on nouns.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It states that subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers, and the distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order. This indicates that there is no morphological case-marking for these core grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses pronominal forms before postpositions and mentions that personal pronouns use the subject form before postpositions. It also notes special irregular forms for the dative case in the 1Sg and 2Sg pronouns. This suggests some form of case marking for pronouns, particularly in the dative case.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Shows distinct subject and object forms for some personal pronouns (1Sg, 3Sg, and 3P1), indicating a limited case system for pronouns.

4. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that Koyra Chiini has no overt case marking for postverbal NPs in either copular or transitive constructions.

5. **Paragraph 9**: Describes the structure of NPs and mentions that subject and direct object NPs have zero case, which can be informally considered nominative. It also mentions postpositions like Dative se and Locative kuna, indicating that some grammatical relations are expressed through postpositions rather than case marking.

6. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the use of pronominal enclitics and mentions that certain pronominal forms are used in direct object function and as complements of the preposition nda. This reinforces the idea that pronominal forms can change based on their syntactic function.

7. **Paragraph 14**: States that personal pronouns can occupy the same syntactic positions as the lexical cores of full NPs, but does not provide additional information on case marking.

8. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions that pronominal PPs and postverbal pronominal objects are cliticized, which suggests a syntactic rather than morphological approach to marking grammatical relations.

From these observations, it is clear that Koyra Chiini does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and postpositions to express grammatical relations. The limited case marking observed is primarily for pronouns, particularly in the dative case.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the language exhibits the following case markers:

1. **Nominative Case**: Marked by suffixes -u and -i for masculine nouns, and unmarked for feminine nouns.
2. **Accusative Case**: Marked by a suprafix (high pitch on the final vowel segment).
3. **Dative Case**: Marked by suffixes -te, -ho, and -ra.
4. **Genitive Case**: Marked by suffixes -u, -i, and -te, and also by a suprafix (high pitch on the final vowel segment).
5. **Locative Case**: Marked by suffixes -te, -ho, and -ra.
6. **Allative Case**: Marked by suffixes attached to the genitive stem.
7. **Ablative-Instrumental Case**: Marked by suffixes attached to the genitive stem.
8. **Oblique Case**: Marked by a suprafix (high pitch on the final vowel segment).

The paragraphs indicate that Sidaama has a productive system of case marking for nouns, with distinct morphological markers for at least eight different cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, locative, allative, ablative-instrumental, and oblique.

### Reasoning:
- **Nominative, Accusative, and Dative Cases**: Explicitly mentioned and described with specific suffixes and suprafixes.
- **Genitive Case**: Described with specific suffixes and suprafixes, and its interaction with other cases.
- **Locative, Allative, and Ablative-Instrumental Cases**: Mentioned with specific suffixes and their attachment to the genitive stem.
- **Oblique Case**: Described as having a suprafix and distinct syntactic environments.

Given the detailed descriptions and the presence of distinct morphological markers for these cases, Sidaama clearly has a productive case system with at least eight cases.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Kunama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kunama, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that what is broadly included under the category of case in Kunama is realized by the use of postpositions. It explicitly states that ""inflectional case is lacking in Kunama unless Banti's tone-marked example proves to be correct."" This suggests that Kunama does not have a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that other nominal relationships, such as locatives, are expressed by postpositions. It also mentions that postpositions are self-standing words with their own accents and are not enclitics, further indicating that Kunama does not use inflectional case markers.

3. **Paragraph 9** notes the use of the postposition +si for dative (and also accusative), reinforcing the idea that Kunama uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.

4. **Paragraph 8** discusses genitive constructions, which are either simple juxtaposition or use a genitive suffix -yna. However, this does not indicate a full-fledged case system but rather a specific marker for possession.

5. **Paragraph 20** mentions the use of postpositions for locative and other relationships, such as ""from"" and ""to,"" which are typically expressed by cases in languages with morphological case systems.

Given these points, it is clear that Kunama primarily uses postpositions to express relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages. There is no evidence of a productive morphological case system for nouns.

**Reasoning:**
- The primary method of indicating grammatical relationships in Kunama is through postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.
- The mention of a genitive suffix does not constitute a full case system.
- The lack of inflectional case markers is explicitly stated in the grammar.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can deduce the number of cases in the language by examining the mentions of case markers and their functions.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions peripheral noun phrases with specific semantic roles and case enclitics that encode multiple meanings such as adessive, allative, and elative.
2. **Paragraph 4** describes the referent case marker encoding five roles: adessive, allative, elative, efficient cause, and point-of-reference.
3. **Paragraph 5** lists several orientation roles encoded by case markers: adessive, path, allative, elative, efficient cause, point of reference, interior location, surface location, and temporal reference.
4. **Paragraph 7** discusses case frames and mentions the use of case-marked noun phrases.
5. **Paragraph 9** talks about genitive case marking on clausal participants.
6. **Paragraph 13** describes the allative NP with a unitary function.
7. **Paragraph 15** mentions the G. setting case marker for surface location and temporal reference.
8. **Paragraph 17** discusses the G. setting case marker indicating manner roles with nominalized adverbs.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Alamblak has a productive case system with multiple cases. Specifically, the language encodes at least the following cases:
- Adessive
- Allative
- Elative
- Efficient cause
- Point of reference
- Interior location
- Surface location
- Temporal reference
- Genitive

Given the variety of cases mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that Alamblak has a rich case system with at least 8-9 distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Amele. The information provided focuses on the syntactic functions of noun phrases, the use of pronouns, and the marking of possession, but it does not describe a system of morphological case marking for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses the syntactic functions of nouns and pronouns, but it does not mention case marking.
2. **Paragraph 4** mentions morphological marking for person and number in inalienably possessed noun phrases but does not refer to case marking.
3. **Paragraph 5** emphasizes the significance of word order for distinguishing syntactic roles (subject, indirect object, direct object) and mentions pronominal and verbal suffixes for person and number agreement, but again, there is no mention of case marking.
4. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** discuss object marking on verbs and the semantic functions of indirect objects, but these are not indicative of a case system for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 18** describe possession and the expression of possession, but they do not provide evidence of a case system.
6. **Paragraph 19** mentions pronominal agreement and appositive constructions but does not indicate case marking.

Given the absence of any explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns and the reliance on word order and pronominal/verbal agreement for syntactic functions, it is reasonable to conclude that Amele does not have a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mountain Arapesh, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses case frames for various verb stems and mentions roles such as Agent (AG), Instrument (INSTR), Experiencer (EXP), Locative (LOC), Referent (REF), and Temporal (TEMP). This suggests a variety of roles that nouns can take, but it does not explicitly state the number of morphological cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Talks about noun classes and number suffixes but does not provide information about case marking.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Describes possessive pronouns and their structure but does not mention case marking.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions possessive modifiers and noun phrase agreement but does not discuss case marking.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses verb classes and transitivity but does not provide information about noun case marking.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Describes object markers and person-number suffixes but does not mention case marking.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Talks about semantic classification of verbs and their case frames but does not provide explicit information about noun case marking.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses morphophonemic rules and noun suffixes but does not mention case marking.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Describes noun phrases and possessive constructions but does not provide information about case marking.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions noun phrase structures and transformations but does not discuss case marking.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Talks about noun phrase modifiers and possessive slots but does not mention case marking.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Describes accompaniment phrases and noun phrase structures but does not provide information about case marking.

13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses structural classification of verbs and subject/object markers but does not mention case marking.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Describes verb classes and agreement with noun classes but does not provide information about case marking.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Talks about adjective suffixation and noun agreement but does not mention case marking.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Describes numeral suffixation and noun agreement but does not provide information about case marking.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Mentions subject markers and mood markers but does not discuss case marking.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses topic and explanatory link structures but does not provide information about case marking.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Describes morphophonemic rules and mood markers but does not mention case marking.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Talks about stative clauses and temporal phrases but does not provide information about case marking.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that while there is extensive discussion on noun classes, number suffixes, possessive constructions, and verb agreement, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The roles such as Agent, Instrument, Experiencer, Locative, Referent, and Temporal are discussed in the context of verb frames rather than as morphological cases marked on nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions ""cases"" in a semantic context but does not provide clear evidence of a productive morphological case system. It discusses the core category and some semantic elements related to actions and completions, but these do not necessarily indicate morphological case marking.

2. **Paragraph 6** discusses the use of singular and plural forms but does not mention case marking.

3. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 11** describe directional pronouns and their syntactical valence, which might suggest some form of locative or directional marking, but this is not sufficient to conclude a full-fledged case system.

4. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss possessive pronouns and kinship terms, indicating some morphological processes related to possession but not explicitly mentioning a broader case system.

5. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** describe various forms and their semantic elements, including prefixes and suffixes, but again, these do not clearly indicate a productive case system.

6. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** provide detailed information on pronouns and their variants, including possessive forms, but do not mention a comprehensive case system.

7. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 13** discuss verbal morphology extensively, including object and subject categories, but do not provide evidence of a nominal case system.

From the information provided, it appears that Asmat has some morphological processes related to possession and directionality, but there is no clear evidence of a productive case system for nouns that covers a wide range of grammatical functions. The language seems to rely more on other morphological and syntactic means to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Batak (Karo), there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various grammatical features, including possessive constructions, verb forms, and the use of clitics, but they do not indicate a systematic use of morphological case-marking for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses suffixes and their allomorphs, but these are primarily related to derivational and inflectional processes rather than case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 2** describes possessive constructions and the ordering of possessive and descriptive elements within noun phrases, but it does not mention case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of possessive pronouns and their enclitic forms, but again, this is not indicative of a case system.
4. **Paragraph 4** provides examples of sentences with different syntactic structures but does not indicate the presence of case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of certain particles and their effects on sentence meaning, unrelated to case-marking.
6. **Paragraph 6** talks about ellipsis and the omission of certain elements in sentences, which does not pertain to case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 7** defines grammatical words and clitics, but does not mention case-marking.
8. **Paragraph 8** discusses stress patterns and vocative elements, which are not related to case-marking.

11. **Paragraph 11** mentions homophonous forms and verb stems, not case-marking.
12. **Paragraph 12** discusses passive constructions and their cross-linguistic comparisons, but not case-marking.
13. **Paragraph 13** lists various affixes and their morphophonemic variations, unrelated to case-marking.
14. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of imperatives and the use of pronouns, not case-marking.
15. **Paragraph 15** describes active and passive constructions and their semantic roles, unrelated to case-marking.
16. **Paragraph 16** mentions subject-raising and reflexivization, not case-marking.
17. **Paragraph 17** discusses incorporated noun phrases and their referential properties, unrelated to case-marking.
18. **Paragraph 18** describes passive reflexives and locative constructions, not case-marking.
19. **Paragraph 19** outlines role restrictions in clause combinations, unrelated to case-marking.
20. **Paragraph 20** discusses fronting of noun phrases and their discourse functions, not case-marking.

Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case marking in the language. Here are the key points relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Pronouns and Possessive Pronouns**:
   - Chamorro has a detailed system of pronouns, including subject markers (hu-type pronouns), object pronouns (yo'-type pronouns), and possessive pronouns.
   - The possessive pronouns are used in possessive constructions and can be affixed to nouns to indicate possession (e.g., kareta-hu 'my car').

2. **Nominalization and Affixation**:
   - The language uses various affixes (infixes, prefixes, and suffixes) for nominalization and verb modification.
   - Examples include the use of -in- and -um- for nominalization, and the possessive pronouns which can be attached to nouns.

3. **Modifiers and Noun Phrases**:
   - Modifiers can precede or follow nouns, and the linking particle na is used in some constructions.
   - The presence of excrescent consonants (like n) in possessive and modification constructions is noted.

4. **Classifiers and Possession**:
   - Chamorro uses classifiers in possessive constructions, such as na' for edible things, ga' for non-human animals, iyo for inanimate objects, and gimen for drinkable things.
   - The classifiers are obligatory in possessive constructions, indicating a structured system for marking possession.

5. **No Explicit Case Paradigms**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for marking syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, dative, etc., on nouns.
   - The language relies more on pronouns, possessive markers, and word order rather than a full-fledged case system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Chamorro does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it uses a combination of pronouns, possessive markers, and word order. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Chamorro in terms of case marking is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Daga,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Daga, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions possessive suffixes but does not provide information about a broader case system.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses various suffixes, including possessive and intensifier suffixes, but does not indicate a comprehensive case system.
3. **Paragraph 3** elaborates on possessive suffixes and their usage, but again, it does not suggest a broader case system beyond possession.
4. **Paragraph 4** talks about the roles of pronouns in sentences but does not provide evidence of a case system for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 5** discusses purpose suffixes and emphatic pronouns but does not indicate a case system for nouns.
6. **Paragraph 6** mentions nominalized verbs and their usage but does not provide information on noun cases.
7. **Paragraph 7** discusses adjectives and their roles but does not indicate a noun case system.
8. **Paragraph 8** states that pronouns are never possessed and have different suffixes, but does not provide information on noun cases.
9. **Paragraph 9** talks about tense and person suffixes but does not provide information on noun cases.
10. **Paragraph 10** mentions possessive suffixes again but does not indicate a broader case system.
11. **Paragraph 11** discusses adjectives and their usage but does not indicate a noun case system.
12. **Paragraph 12** talks about clitics and their roles but does not provide information on noun cases.
13. **Paragraph 13** lists various word classes but does not indicate a noun case system.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses clause structures but does not provide information on noun cases.
15. **Paragraph 15** mentions locatives acting as pronouns but does not indicate a noun case system.
16. **Paragraph 16** discusses postpositions and their roles but does not provide information on noun cases.
17. **Paragraph 17** elaborates on the structure of noun phrases but does not indicate a noun case system.
18. **Paragraph 18** discusses possessive phrases but does not provide information on a broader noun case system.
19. **Paragraph 19** talks about sentence types and conjunctions but does not provide information on noun cases.
20. **Paragraph 20** mentions substantive clitics but does not indicate a noun case system.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that Daga has a system of possessive suffixes and various other suffixes for intensification and emphasis. However, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns beyond possessive marking. The information provided suggests that Daga does not have a comprehensive morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dani (Lower Grand Valley), the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that case relations are marked in post-positions and verbs, suggesting that case marking is not primarily done through noun inflections but through other means such as verb affixation and post-positions.

2. **Paragraph 9** discusses the marking of independent nouns and pronouns occupying the agent role, hinting at an ergative structure where the subject of transitive verbs is marked differently from the object of transitive verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs. However, it does not specify a productive case paradigm for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of verbs with different roles (e.g., direct object, indirect object) but does not indicate a productive case system for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 11** emphasizes the contrast between personal and non-personal objects and their semantic relationships, marked by word order, post-positions, and verb affixation, rather than a noun case system.

5. **Paragraph 18** notes that noun phrases referring to the subject of a verb occur with and presuppose a subject category usually marked in an affix to the verb, again indicating that case marking is not primarily on nouns.

From these observations, it is clear that Dani does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on verb affixation, post-positions, and word order to mark grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Hamtai. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, such as pronouns, possessive pronouns, and sentence structures, but they do not mention any specific morphological case markers for nouns. Instead, they describe the use of pronouns and possessive forms, which do not constitute a case system.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Discusses types of clauses but does not mention case marking.
   - **Paragraph 2**: Lists subject pronouns without indicating case distinctions.
   - **Paragraph 3**: Mentions function words and particles but not case markers.
   - **Paragraph 4**: Describes possessive pronouns, which are not considered case markers.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Talks about clitics forming adverbial prepositional phrases, not case markers.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Hua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hua, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative (or Absolutive)**: This is the unmarked case used for subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect objects of (di)transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal compounds. It is marked by the suffix ø or -a (citation suffix).

2. **Ergative**: This case is used for subjects of (di)transitive verbs and has distinct forms in the singular and plural. It is marked by suffixes such as /mu'/, ['ßamu'], and -mamu'.

3. **Genitive**: This case is used to create possessive phrases and acts adjectivally. It has singular and plural forms, marked by suffixes like -ma' and -'i'.

4. **Locative/Allative**: This case is used to indicate location or direction towards a place. It is marked by the suffix -ro'.

5. **Inessive/Illative**: This case indicates being inside or moving into something. It is marked by the suffix -vi'.

6. **Ablative**: This case indicates movement away from something. It is marked by the suffix -roti'.

7. **Elative**: This case indicates movement out of something. It is marked by the suffix -viti'.

8. **Benefactive**: This case indicates the beneficiary of an action. It is marked by the suffix -hi'.

9. **Comitative**: This case indicates accompaniment. It is marked by the suffix -Ki'.

10. **Vocative**: This case is used for direct address and is marked by the suffix -a or -o.

The language Hua exhibits a productive case paradigm with at least ten distinct cases, including the nominative, ergative, genitive, locative/allative, inessive/illative, ablative, elative, benefactive, comitative, and vocative.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly describes the use and marking of each case.
- Each case has a distinct function and morphological marker.
- The cases cover a wide range of syntactic and semantic roles.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Ilocano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Core and Oblique Cases**: Paragraph 8 mentions that Ilocano articles encode number and two cases: core and oblique. Core nouns can be morphological arguments of verbs and can be replaced by enclitic pronouns, while oblique nouns cannot be replaced by enclitic pronouns but may play an essential role in the semantic frame of a verb.

2. **Ergative and Absolutive Cases**: Paragraphs 1, 2, and 6 discuss the ergative and absolutive cases. The ergative case is used for the actor of a transitive verb, while the absolutive case is used for the non-actor (patient, location, recipient, benefactor, reason, or theme).

3. **Instrumental and Benefactive Focus**: Paragraphs 5 and 14 mention the instrumental and benefactive focus, which place the instrument or beneficiary of an action in the absolutive case. These are more semantic roles rather than distinct morphological cases.

4. **Possessive and Oblique Pronouns**: Paragraphs 3, 10, and 19 discuss possessive and oblique pronouns, which are formed by adding enclitic ergative pronouns to specific stems or articles. These pronouns indicate possession or direction toward a person but do not constitute additional morphological cases.

5. **Summary of Case Marking**: The primary morphological cases identified are the core (which includes ergative and absolutive) and oblique cases. The instrumental and benefactive focus, while important, do not constitute separate morphological cases but rather specific uses of the absolutive case.

Given this information, Ilocano has a productive case paradigm that includes:

- Core case (encompassing ergative and absolutive)
- Oblique case

Thus, Ilocano has 2 morphological cases.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the case marker -m, which is used for marking oblique NPs expressing goal, purpose, recipient, and beneficiary, as well as certain types of objects. It is noted that -m is the only case marker of syntactic significance, while other case markers are of semantic function and are discussed in another chapter.

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph lists the case markers for peripheral NPs in Imonda, including locative (-ia), cause (-ia), goal (-m), source (-n8i), and instrument (-na). It mentions that Imonda has a quaternary system conflating locative and cause.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph differentiates between core and peripheral objects, indicating that peripheral NPs are marked by case marking and verbal agreement, while core objects are not overtly indicated by morphosyntactic means.

4. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph mentions the optional rule of final -m deletion in connected speech, indicating that -m is a general phonological rule and is recoverable.

5. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the glossing of morphemes, particularly the case marker -m, which has multiple functions including goal marking, marking recipients and benefactives, and disambiguating human objects.

6. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that Imonda has a split ergative system and discusses the optional nature of case marking in many Papuan languages, including Imonda.

7. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a broader perspective on Papuan languages, mentioning that many have no case marking or optional case marking, but it does not provide specific details about Imonda.

8. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses dependent nouns that function as adverbials and are fused with the case marker, indicating the adverbial character of these nouns.

9. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses interrogative pronouns and mentions that case markers other than -m may not be suffixed to certain pronouns, indicating a restriction in case marking.

10. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph is an index and does not provide specific details about the case system in Imonda.

11. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the derivation of adverbs from personal pronouns and does not provide specific details about the case system in Imonda.

12. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the use of the nominaliser and case markers in specific constructions but does not provide a comprehensive overview of the case system.

13. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses adjectivalisation and the use of case markers with derived adjectives but does not provide a comprehensive overview of the case system.

14. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph categorizes stems that take case marking as nominals but does not provide specific details about the case system.

15. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses NP constituents and mentions that all nominals may function as the head of an NP and take case marking, but it does not provide specific details about the case system.

16. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses pronouns and their inability to take the possessive clitic but does not provide specific details about the case system.

17. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph provides examples of ascriptive predicates and the use of case markers but does not provide a comprehensive overview of the case system.

18. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the use of emphatic forms of personal pronouns but does not provide specific details about the case system.

19. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the nominaliser in comparative evidence but does not provide specific details about the case system.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses personal pronouns and their behavior with respect to case marking, indicating that possessive marking must intervene between the pronoun and the locative marker.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Imonda has a system of case marking that includes at least four distinct cases (locative, cause, goal, and source), with the goal marker -m also serving multiple functions. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for the number of cases in Imonda is:

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",5 cases,4 cases
Atayal,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the nominative, genitive, and dative cases.
2. **Paragraph 5** reiterates that Atayal nouns/pronouns fill roles using nominative, genitive, and dative cases.
3. **Paragraph 6** discusses how verbs indicate various case relations but does not introduce any new cases beyond nominative, genitive, and dative.
4. **Paragraph 10** mentions the nominative case for agents and an unknown case for direct objects, but this does not introduce a new case.
5. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of the dative case used for various functions, including belonging and location.
6. **Paragraph 14** mentions the genitive case for agents and nominative for direct objects in certain constructions.
7. **Paragraph 15** discusses the genitive case used for possession.
8. **Paragraph 17** suggests the dative case for patients in some contexts.
9. **Paragraph 20** mentions the nominative case for pronominal predicates.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Atayal has three productive case paradigms for nouns: nominative, genitive, and dative. There is no evidence of additional cases beyond these three.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify several case markers in Kewa. Here is the analysis:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the clitics `-me` and `-para`, suggesting they function as surface case markers for certain tagmemes.
2. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of locative (`-para`), instrumental (`-me`), and directive (`-nane`) markers.
3. **Paragraph 12** mentions an accusative marker (`-daa`), which often marks the object-as-referent.
4. **Paragraph 14** discusses the possessive clitic `-na`.
5. **Paragraph 19** further confirms the possessive marker `-na`.

From these paragraphs, we can identify at least five distinct productive case markers in Kewa:
- **Nominative/Subject** (implied by the use of `-me` for subject-as-agent)
- **Accusative** (`-daa`)
- **Locative** (`-para`)
- **Instrumental** (`-me`)
- **Possessive** (`-na`)

Given this information, we can conclude that Kewa has a productive case system with at least five cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of distinct markers for nominative, accusative, locative, instrumental, and possessive cases indicates a system with multiple productive case paradigms.
- The markers are used to denote specific grammatical functions, fitting the definition of grammatical cases.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",6-7 cases,5 cases
Kobon,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kobon, the following observations can be made regarding case marking:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses reflexive pronouns and possessive adjectives but does not mention any case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Focuses on pronominal forms and their distinctions but does not provide evidence of case marking on nouns.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that nouns are not formally divided into genders and discusses plural marking but does not indicate case marking.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses tense, aspect, and person-number marking but does not mention case marking on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Talks about derivational suffixes and nominalization but does not provide evidence of case marking.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions postpositional particles that mark nouns for specific functions (e.g., accompanier, coordinated nominal, circumstance, concessive) but does not indicate a productive case paradigm.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses pronominal forms and their functions but does not mention case marking on nouns.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions postpositional particles and their functions but does not provide evidence of case marking.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses nominalization and adjectivalization but does not indicate case marking on nouns.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions reflexive and possessive forms but does not provide evidence of case marking.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses indefinite pronouns and their usage but does not mention case marking.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Talks about temporal and noncoreferential subject forms but does not indicate case marking on nouns.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses noun phrases and their functions but does not provide evidence of case marking.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Mentions derivational suffixes and nominalization but does not indicate case marking on nouns.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses intonation and noun phrases but does not mention case marking.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Talks about locative words and their functions but does not provide evidence of case marking.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses pronominal forms and their special usages but does not mention case marking on nouns.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions postpositional particles and their functions but does not provide evidence of case marking.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses sentence structure and movement of heavy structures but does not mention case marking.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Talks about conjunctions and temporal relationships but does not provide evidence of case marking.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Kobon uses postpositional particles to mark specific functions of nouns (such as accompanier, coordinated nominal, circumstance, concessive, and territorial origin). However, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns that would indicate a system of grammatical case marking as defined in the context of this feature.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Kombai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, the language does not exhibit any productive case paradigms for nouns. The information provided indicates that nouns in Kombai do not undergo morphological changes to express different grammatical functions. Instead, the language relies on other syntactic and morphological strategies, such as the use of relational nouns and head noun insertion in subordinate clauses, to convey relationships typically marked by case in other languages.

Here is the reasoning based on the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1 (3.2 NOUNS)**: This paragraph explicitly states that apart from possessive pronominal prefixes, there is no noun-related morphology in Kombai. This strongly suggests the absence of morphological case-marking.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the use of head nouns in questioned NPs and relative clauses, indicating that these head nouns have a generalized grammatical meaning rather than specific lexical content. This implies that grammatical relationships are not marked by case but by syntactic structures.

3. **Paragraph 7 (3.1 VERBS)**: Mentions that verbs are inflected for switch-reference and tense, but there is no mention of case inflection for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 10**: Describes the grammatical functions of the noun ""ro"" as a classificatory head noun in various constructions, again indicating that grammatical relationships are managed through syntactic means rather than morphological case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 18 (5.3 RELATIONAL NOUNS AND GRAMMATICALISATION)**: Discusses the grammaticalisation of relational nouns and their transition into functors, further supporting the idea that Kombai does not use morphological case-marking but rather relational nouns and other grammatical elements to express relationships.

6. **Paragraph 20 (3.1.3.4 COPULAS; THE VERB 'TO BE')**: Mentions the use of copula-support to enable nominal categories to function predicatively, which is another syntactic strategy rather than morphological case-marking.

Given the consistent absence of any mention of morphological case-marking for nouns and the reliance on other grammatical strategies, it is clear that Kombai does not have a productive case system.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the morphological and syntactic features of nouns, including locational nouns that take a locative suffix -n. It mentions that common nouns use postpositional phrases for spatial relations, while locational nouns use the locative suffix. This indicates some form of case-marking for locative relations.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Describes the use of postpositional phrases and locative suffixes for expressing spatial relations. It also mentions that place nouns can function as adjuncts without morphological marking, but locational nouns use the locative suffix.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions the use of locative and perlative suffixes on nouns to form adjuncts, indicating the presence of locative and perlative cases.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the locative and perlative suffixes in more detail, showing examples of their use in sentences.

5. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions the use of locative suffixes on place names and other nouns to form locational phrases.

6. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions three spatial/relational cases but states that they have a low functional load.

7. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the use of locative and perlative suffixes in forming locational phrases.

From these points, it is clear that Lavukaleve has overt marking for locative and perlative cases, which are used to express spatial relations. However, there is no mention of other syntactic cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive being marked morphologically. The presence of locative and perlative suffixes suggests that the language has overt marking for concrete (or peripheral) case relations, but not for core syntactic relations.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

Lavukaleve has overt marking only for concrete (or peripheral) case relations, such as locatives or perlatives, but does not have a productive case paradigm for core syntactic relations.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Madurese, the following observations can be made regarding the presence of productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses nominal inflection and derivation in Madurese. It mentions that reduplication is the only productive inflection for noun stems, primarily indicating plurality. There is no mention of any case-marking morphology for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph explicitly states that there is no case marking on NPs in Madurese, with the exception of the first person singular possessive. This indicates that nouns do not have morphological case marking.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses possession and the use of the definite suffix -na for indicating possession. It does not mention any case-marking morphology.

4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses prepositional marking of direct objects under certain conditions, but it does not indicate that this marking is a part of a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it suggests that prepositions are used to mark certain relationships, which is different from morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses lexical categories and mentions that Madurese does not have a distinct category for adjectives and that the noun/verb distinction is somewhat blurred. However, it does not provide any evidence of morphological case marking for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses the use of numerals and quantifiers with nouns, but again, there is no mention of case marking.

7. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses the use of prepositions and their role in marking relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. It does not indicate the presence of morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses pronouns and their forms, including possessive forms. It does not mention any case-marking morphology for nouns.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, it is clear that Madurese does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are indicated through prepositions and other means.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mokilese, here is the analysis regarding the presence and number of productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: The paragraphs discuss possessive suffixes extensively, indicating that possessive relationships are marked morphologically. However, possessive marking alone does not constitute a case system unless it includes other syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, etc.

2. **Locative and Directional Constructions**: There are mentions of locative forms and constructs (e.g., ""imwen"" and ""umwin"" for 'house of' and 'house in', respectively). These forms suggest some degree of locative marking, but it is not clear if these are part of a broader case system or if they are isolated locative markers.

3. **Construct Forms**: The construct forms (e.g., ""oadoan"" for 'name of') indicate a morphological strategy to show possession or relational nouns, but again, this does not necessarily imply a full-fledged case system.

4. **Nominalization and Descriptive Nominals**: The language has complex nominalization processes and descriptive nominals, which involve possessive suffixes and constructs. These processes show morphological richness but do not directly indicate a case system.

5. **Absence of Clear Case Paradigms**: Throughout the provided text, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm that marks syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, dative, etc., across all nouns. The focus is more on possessive and locative constructs.

6. **Borderline Case-Marking**: The presence of locative and possessive constructs suggests some borderline case-marking, but these are not integrated into a broader syntactic case system.

Given the evidence, Mokilese does not exhibit a productive case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns. Instead, it shows morphological marking for possession and some locative constructs, which are more characteristic of borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Palauan,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case-marking system for nouns in Palauan. The text discusses various aspects of pronouns, possessor suffixes, and noun phrases, but it does not provide evidence of a morphological case system that marks nouns for grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

The paragraphs mention possessor suffixes and the structure of possessed nouns, which indicate possession but do not constitute a full-fledged case system. The discussion of pronouns and their forms also does not imply a case system for nouns.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, I will analyze the information to determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Discusses personal pronouns and their inflection through phonetic root-change or apophony. It mentions four series of personal pronouns but does not provide evidence of case marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Further elaborates on the personal pronouns and their usage, including possessive forms. It mentions possessive forms but does not indicate a broader case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Mentions parts of speech and the distinction between nouns and adjectives, as well as the pseudo-flexion of genitive (possessive) forms through apophony. This suggests some form of possessive marking but does not confirm a full case system.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Provides examples of possessive constructions with nouns, such as ""wa ma"" (thy hand) and ""na dama"" (his tail). This indicates possessive marking but does not provide evidence of other cases like nominative, accusative, etc.

5. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Discusses possessive-determined forms for relationship terms like ""father"" and ""mother,"" which are treated as flexional forms. This reinforces the presence of possessive marking but does not indicate additional cases.

6. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Describes subordinative combinations of words, including possessive phrases. The examples provided, such as ""aka’la obo"" (jungle pig) and ""joku falam"" (dog’s head), indicate possessive constructions but do not suggest a broader case system.

### Reasoning:

The information provided in the paragraphs consistently points to the presence of possessive marking in the language. However, there is no evidence of a broader case system that includes nominative, accusative, dative, or other cases. The possessive marking appears to be the primary form of morphological marking on nouns, with no indication of additional productive case paradigms.

### Conclusion:

**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Suena, I will analyze the information to determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - Mentions a formula for noun phrases: ""Formula: (N) + (Possessor) + Head noun.""
   - Indicates the presence of a ""Head case"" which is absent in some contexts.
   - This suggests some form of case marking, but it is not clear how many cases are involved.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Mentions relators such as ""ami"" (from), ""awa"" (to), and ""ra"" (locative).
   - These relators function similarly to English prepositions but are described as locatives.
   - This indicates the presence of locative case marking.

3. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Describes a sentence structure involving subject, object, and direct object noun phrases.
   - Mentions specific word orders and the use of markers like ""ami"" for included clauses.
   - Suggests some syntactic marking but does not specify distinct cases.

4. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Describes noun phrases with obligatory relators and pronouns.
   - Indicates a structure involving noun phrases and relators, which might imply case-like functions.

5. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Provides examples of noun phrases with instrumental and locative meanings.
   - Uses markers like ""kota"" (not-but) and ""Inst."" (instrumental).
   - Suggests the presence of instrumental and locative cases.

### Reasoning:

- The information provided indicates that Suena uses markers for locative and instrumental functions, which are concrete case relations.
- There is no clear evidence of a full-fledged case system with multiple syntactic cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
- The presence of markers for specific semantic roles (locative, instrumental) suggests that Suena has overt marking for peripheral case relations.

Given this information, Suena appears to have case marking only for specific semantic roles rather than a comprehensive syntactic case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",4 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Taba,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Taba as follows:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that Taba has adpositions (both prepositions and a postposition) to mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases. The postposition is used for locative marking, while prepositions mark other roles. This indicates the presence of locative and possibly other oblique cases.

2. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of nouns in various syntactic roles, including as objects of a postposition (locative case) and in possessive phrases. The possessive construction involves a possessive particle, which suggests a genitive case.

3. **Paragraph 19** lists four prepositions in Taba: ada (comitative/instrumental), pake (instrumental), untuk (beneficiary), and lo (similative). This indicates the presence of instrumental and comitative cases, among others.

4. **Paragraph 14** discusses the syntactic roles of arguments in Taba, including the use of adpositions for marking certain arguments. This reinforces the idea that Taba uses adpositions to mark various case roles.

From the information provided, it is clear that Taba has overt marking for several concrete (or peripheral) case relations such as locative, instrumental, comitative, and beneficiary. However, there is no mention of a productive case paradigm for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

Given this evidence, Taba appears to have case marking primarily for peripheral roles, without a productive case paradigm for core grammatical relations. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Taba's case-marking system is:

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tagalog,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tagalog, the language exhibits a system of marking nouns with three different forms or markers: ang, ng, and sa. These markers indicate different grammatical functions within sentences, such as predicates, topics, verb complements, and possessive modifiers. The forms or markers do not correspond to a large number of distinct cases but rather to a limited set of grammatical roles.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 2**: It describes that every marked noun occurs in three different forms or with three different markers: ang, ng, and sa. These forms indicate specific grammatical functions such as predicates, topics, verb complements, and possessive modifiers.
2. **Paragraph 6**: It reiterates that Tagalog has three types of marked nominals (personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns), each occurring in one of three different forms according to its function in the sentence.
3. **Paragraph 7**: The chart of personal pronouns shows that each pronoun category is represented by three forms: ang, ng, and sa.
4. **Paragraph 16**: It discusses the actor complement, object complement, and directional complement, which are expressed by ng phrases, ang phrases, and sa phrases, respectively.

These paragraphs collectively indicate that Tagalog uses three primary markers (ang, ng, sa) to denote different grammatical roles, which aligns with the concept of having three cases in the context of productive case paradigms of nouns.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Tukang Besi:

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions the genitive article ""nu"" and its distributional restrictions, indicating the presence of a genitive case.
2. **Paragraph 10** discusses the oblique case marker ""i"" and its use with prepositions, suggesting an oblique case.
3. **Paragraph 16** describes the nominative article ""na"" and the non-nominative core article ""te,"" indicating a nominative case and a non-nominative case.
4. **Paragraph 17** discusses object suffixes and their impact on the distribution of core case-marking articles, reinforcing the presence of nominative and non-nominative cases.
5. **Paragraph 19** differentiates articles and prepositions, confirming the use of core articles (nominative and non-nominative) and oblique articles.

From these points, we can infer that Tukang Besi has at least the following cases:
- **Nominative case** (marked by ""na"")
- **Non-nominative core case** (marked by ""te"")
- **Oblique case** (marked by ""i"")
- **Genitive case** (marked by ""nu"")

This suggests that Tukang Besi has a system of at least four productive cases.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Una,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in the Una language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Una has a case system that marks semantic relationships between participants, locations, and objects within a clause. It lists several case markers but does not specify the exact number.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides a list of cases: Nominative, Genitive, Locative, Allative, Instrumental, Referential, Reflexive, and mentions the Vocative case. This suggests at least 8 cases.
3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the Referential case in detail, providing examples of its use.
4. **Paragraph 4** mentions the Nominative case and provides examples.
5. **Paragraph 5** elaborates on the Genitive case and provides examples.
6. **Paragraph 6** discusses the Dative case and provides examples.
7. **Paragraph 7** mentions the Ergative case and provides examples.
8. **Paragraph 8** provides additional context for the use of the Nominative case.
9. **Paragraph 9** discusses the Reflexive case and provides examples.
10. **Paragraph 10** elaborates on the Dative case.
11. **Paragraph 11** discusses the Genitive clause.
12. **Paragraph 12** summarizes the Ergative, Dative, and other cases.
13. **Paragraph 13** provides additional details on the Dative case.
14. **Paragraph 14** discusses the Referential case.
15. **Paragraph 15** provides examples of the Locative case.
16. **Paragraph 16** provides additional context for the Locative case.
17. **Paragraph 17** provides examples of the Locative case in different contexts.
18. **Paragraph 18** discusses the Instrumental case.
19. **Paragraph 19** provides additional context for pronouns and their use in different cases.
20. **Paragraph 20** discusses aspects of verb tense and actor suffixes, which are not directly relevant to case marking.

From the information provided, we can identify the following cases in Una:
- Nominative
- Genitive
- Locative
- Allative
- Instrumental
- Referential
- Reflexive
- Ergative
- Vocative

This totals to 9 cases. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Una is ""8-9 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",no morphological case-marking,8-9 cases
Usan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Usan, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and productivity of case marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses nominalization and the use of nominalized verbs as nouns or adjectives. However, it does not provide information about case marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2** describes possessive pronouns and their usage, but it does not mention any case marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3** focuses on the structure of noun phrases and the order of modifiers but does not provide evidence of case marking.

4. **Paragraph 4** does not contain relevant information about case marking.

5. **Paragraph 5** mentions that there is no inflection of nouns in Usan, which strongly suggests the absence of morphological case marking.

6. **Paragraph 6** discusses syntactic functions and verb agreement but does not mention case marking.

7. **Paragraph 7** describes word order and the use of postpositions, indicating that Usan is postpositional (e.g., 'axe-with'). This suggests that relational roles are expressed through postpositions rather than case marking.

8. **Paragraph 8** provides information about pronouns but does not mention case marking.

9. **Paragraph 9** discusses relative clauses and verb inflection but does not provide information about case marking.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses verb classification and semantic functions but does not mention case marking.

11. **Paragraph 11** focuses on subordination and the function of the determiner eng but does not mention case marking.

12. **Paragraph 12** describes postpositions used for comitative relations, reinforcing the idea that relational roles are expressed through postpositions rather than case marking.

13. **Paragraph 13** discusses the marking of Beneficiary and Instrument roles using postpositions, further supporting the absence of morphological case marking.

14. **Paragraph 14** provides examples of relative clauses with oblique object markers but does not indicate a productive case system.

15. **Paragraph 15** discusses verb morphology and pragmatic usage but does not mention case marking.

16. **Paragraph 16** describes medial verbs and nominalization but does not provide evidence of case marking.

17. **Paragraph 17** discusses switch-reference and person-number marking but does not mention case marking.

18. **Paragraph 18** provides a summary of noun phrase structure but does not indicate case marking.

19. **Paragraph 19** discusses relative clauses in other languages but does not provide information about case marking in Usan.

20. **Paragraph 20** describes pronominal reference and social distance but does not mention case marking.

Based on the information provided, it is clear that Usan does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, relational roles are expressed through postpositions.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system for nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the lack of case marking on nouns and the reliance on verbal prefixes to indicate grammatical relations. It mentions that nouns do not have case marking affixes and that the grammatical relations are indicated by verbal prefixes.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph introduces the oblique suffix -n/-nan, which is used to mark peripheral, adverbial-like case uses such as instruments, locatives, and temporals. This is identified as the single nominal case marker in Yimas.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the use of dative affixes in ditransitive verbs.

Manambu,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Manambu by examining the descriptions of case forms and their functions. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

- **Paragraph 1** mentions that Manambu has nine case forms, each with multiple meanings and functions. It also discusses a ""lumper"" approach, which identifies nine cases, and a ""splitter"" approach, which identifies eighteen cases based on functions. However, the ""lumper"" approach is preferred for its economy and semantic connections.
  
- **Paragraph 2** reiterates that Manambu has a system of nine case forms, each corresponding to a form, and distinguishes eighteen cases by their functions and meanings.

- **Paragraph 3** provides detailed examples of how different cases are used, including the accusative-locative, dative-aversive, allative-instrumental, and comitative cases.

- **Paragraph 4** summarizes the polysemy of zero case marking and the principles of dependent marking on nouns, further supporting the existence of multiple case forms.

- **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of the dative-aversive case and its various functions, reinforcing the complexity and multiplicity of case forms in Manambu.

- **Paragraph 6** highlights the functions of unmarked nouns and their contrast with case-marked forms, indicating a structured case system.

Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Duna as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of the possessor/beneficiary postposition -ya and the locative marker -ta. This indicates the presence of at least two cases: a beneficiary/possessor case and a locative case.

2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of a specific marker -na and a locative marker -ta, reinforcing the presence of locative and specificity marking.

3. **Paragraph 6** describes the contrasted subject (CS) marking with -ka, which is used to distinguish the subject from other participants in the clause. This resembles ergative case marking.

4. **Paragraph 7** elaborates on the contrasted subject marking (CS) and its functional resemblance to ergative case marking, indicating that Duna has a system for marking subjects in a way that resembles case marking.

5. **Paragraph 11** discusses the exclusivity marker -nga, which typically occurs on subject pronouns, and the use of dependent third person pronouns, which can indicate pragmatic prominence.

6. **Paragraph 12** divides Duna nominals into common nouns, proper names, and personal pronouns, and mentions that nominal predicates cannot be marked with TAM markers or the negative circumfix, but can be marked with epistemic assessment markers.

7. **Paragraph 13** shows the use of the exclusive marker -nga in a reflexive clause, suggesting that Duna has a way to mark reflexivity.

8. **Paragraph 14** discusses the use of adjectives and the nominaliser -ne, indicating that adjectives can function pronominally as well as adnominally.

9. **Paragraph 16** outlines the evidential paradigm in Duna, distinguishing four evidential categories: Visual, Sensory, Resultative, and Notional. This indicates a complex system of marking information source but does not directly relate to case marking.

10. **Paragraph 17** describes a reciprocal construction with the dual pronoun keno, indicating that Duna has a way to mark reciprocal actions.

11. **Paragraph 18** shows the use of the exclusive marker -nga in a clause with a reflexive meaning, reinforcing the presence of reflexive marking.

12. **Paragraph 19** discusses the specificity marker -na and its use in various constructions, indicating that Duna has a way to mark specificity.

13. **Paragraph 20** mentions the use of the pronoun khunu in reference to groups that include addressees, suggesting a system for marking group reference.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Duna has a productive case-marking system that includes at least the following cases: beneficiary/possessor, locative, contrasted subject (ergative-like), and specificity marking. This suggests that Duna has a system with multiple cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Taiap,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, the language exhibits a productive case-marking system with several distinct cases. Here is the reasoning for the chosen option:

1. **Ergative Case**: The language has an ergative case clitic that marks the subject of transitive verbs. This is evident from multiple paragraphs, particularly Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, and 16. The ergative case clitic varies based on gender and number (e.g., =ŋi for masculine, =yi for feminine, =gi for plural).

2. **Peripheral Cases**: Paragraph 7 and 18 outline several peripheral cases, including locative, ablative, perlative, and dative. These cases are used to mark various semantic roles such as location, movement, and recipient. The locative case, for example, has different forms for animate and inanimate referents.

3. **Possessive Case**: Paragraph 19 and 20 discuss possessive clitics that mark possession, association, and part-whole relationships. These clitics also vary based on animacy and number.

4. **Productivity and Usage**: The case markers are productive and used consistently in the language to mark grammatical relations and semantic roles. The ergative case, while optional, is frequently used to resolve ambiguity and indicate agentivity, control, and animacy.

Given the presence of ergative, locative, ablative, perlative, dative, and possessive cases, Taiap has a robust case-marking system that goes beyond just core grammatical relations to include various peripheral and semantic roles.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the use of free personal pronouns and their syntactic roles as subjects and objects. It mentions that grammatical relations are marked on verbs, and pronouns functioning as overt subject and object arguments can be dropped without causing ambiguity. This indicates that subject and object roles are marked on the verb rather than on the nouns or pronouns themselves.

2. **Paragraph 4**: Explicitly states that ""Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather, verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause."" This is a clear indication that Mian does not use morphological case-marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 5**: Further supports the absence of morphological case-marking on nouns by explaining that objects are indexed on the verb and are never overtly case-marked. It describes different patterns of object indexation on verbs but does not mention any case-marking on the nouns themselves.

4. **Paragraph 13**: Reiterates that the subject noun phrase is not overtly case-marked and that the grammatical relation of subject is indexed on the verb by a pronominal suffix.

5. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses attributive possession and the structure of noun phrases, indicating that possession is shown by the order of elements rather than by case-marking.

6. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions that noun phrases as locative adjuncts are not marked by any determiner and are analyzed as adjuncts rather than core arguments, again suggesting the absence of morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Mian does not employ morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, grammatical relations are indicated through verbal affixes and the syntactic structure of noun phrases.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Inanwatan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Personal Pronouns and Oblique Forms**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions oblique forms of personal pronouns used for peripheral functions, which are likely derived from postpositions (e.g., -ra meaning 'to, for, about').
   - Examples include combinations with postpositions like -wai 'to' and -(u)ru '(together)with'.

2. **Core and Peripheral Nominals**:
   - Paragraph 9 distinguishes between core nominals (subject and object) and peripheral nominals, with core nominals being unmarked and peripheral nominals taking postpositions.
   - Peripheral nominals are not cross-referenced in the verb, unlike core nominals.

3. **Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 15 provides examples of postpositions marking peripheral functions such as instrument, place, and time (e.g., -wai 'to(wards)', -wo 'in, at', -woide 'from').

4. **Subject and Object Prefixes**:
   - Paragraph 13 details subject and object prefixes for verbs, indicating that the language uses verbal affixes to mark grammatical relations rather than nominal case markers.

5. **Absence of Nominal Case Marking**:
   - Throughout the provided paragraphs, there is no mention of nominal case suffixes or inflections directly attached to nouns to mark grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

From the analysis, it is clear that Inanwatan does not employ a productive case-marking system on nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions for peripheral functions and verbal prefixes for core grammatical relations.

**Reasoning**:
- The language uses postpositions for peripheral functions rather than nominal case inflections.
- Core grammatical relations (subject and object) are marked by verbal prefixes, not by nominal case markers.
- There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in the provided text.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"### Reasoning:

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates the lack of case inflection: ""Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.""

3. **Paragraph 11** discusses categorial indeterminacy and the use of pronominal prefixes for possession but does not mention any case-marking.

4. **Paragraph 13** details possessive prefixes but does not mention any other types of case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 18** again confirms the absence of case inflection: ""As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.""

6. **Paragraph 19** discusses argument incorporation and pronominal prefixes but does not mention any case-marking.

7. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 21** discuss the use of pronominal prefixes and possessive constructions but do not mention any case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss various grammatical categories and pronominal prefixes but do not mention any case-marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit statements in the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Abui does not have morphological case-marking for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Maricopa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maricopa, we can determine the number of cases in the language by analyzing the case markers and their functions.

1. **Paragraph 7** lists the noun case markers found in Maricopa:
   - **-sh**: subject, predicate noun
   - **0**: object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject predicate nominal and nominalized clauses
   - **-m**: comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topic of', 'by way of' directional
   - **-li**: locative (at) and illative (to/toward)
   - **-ly**: locative (in/on) and illative (into/to)
   - **-k**: general locative and directional

2. **Paragraph 2** mentions that subject and object cases are always expressed by case marking on the noun phrase and agreement on the verb.

3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 11** reiterate that the grammatical role filled by a noun phrase within a predication is signaled by the case suffix at the end of the noun phrase.

4. **Paragraph 17** specifies that the case suffixes -ii and -ly are not used on animate nouns or personal pronouns, indicating that these suffixes are used for locative and illative functions.

5. **Paragraph 19** provides examples of noun phrases marked with case suffixes, showing the use of locative and directional markers.

From the information provided, we can identify the following productive case paradigms in Maricopa:
- **Subject case (-sh)**
- **Object case (0)**
- **Comitative/Instrumental/Directional case (-m)**
- **Locative/Illative case (-li, -ly, -k)**

This gives us a total of six distinct cases: subject, object, comitative/instrumental/directional, and three locative/illative cases.

**Reasoning:**
Maricopa has a productive case system with distinct suffixes for subject, object, comitative/instrumental/directional, and multiple locative/illative cases. The presence of these distinct markers indicates a system with 6-7 cases.

4. **Paragraph 7** mentions the ergative case marker and the use of -ne for direct objects.
5. **Paragraph 15** refers to the genitive case, indicating that genitive is also marked.
6. **Paragraph 16** mentions locative marking, which suggests the presence of a locative case.

From this information, we can infer that Nez Perce has at least the following cases:
- Ergative
- Direct Object (Accusative)
- Ablative
- Genitive
- Locative

This gives us a total of five distinct cases.

### Reasoning:
- The ergative case is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
- Direct object marking is also mentioned, which can be considered an accusative case.
- The ablative case is discussed in detail.
- The genitive case is mentioned in the context of possession.
- The locative case is indicated by locative marking.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oneida, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions that semantic roles are not expressed by syntax nor, except for possessives and locatives, in the noun morphology. This suggests that Oneida does not have a broad system of morphological case-marking for syntactic roles.

2. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 17** discuss possessive prefixes and noun suffixes, including locative suffixes. The possessive prefixes indicate possession, while the locative suffixes mark spatial relations such as 'on', 'in', 'under', and 'near'. These are specific to certain nouns and do not form a broad case system.

3. **Paragraph 4** also mentions that the locative role is coded by noun suffixes and particles, indicating that locative marking is present but does not extend to a full case system.

4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 12** discuss noun incorporation and derivational suffixes, which further support the idea that Oneida uses specific morphological markers for certain roles but does not have a comprehensive case system.

5. **Paragraph 19** describes syntactic nouns formed from verbs, which again points to a reliance on verb morphology and incorporation rather than a case system for marking grammatical relations.

From this analysis, it is clear that Oneida does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the sense of a comprehensive system marking syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it uses specific possessive and locative markers, which are more aligned with what is referred to as ""borderline case-marking.""

**Reasoning:**
- Oneida uses possessive prefixes and locative suffixes, but these do not constitute a full-fledged case system.
- The language relies heavily on verb morphology and noun incorporation for expressing grammatical relations.
- The presence of specific markers for possession and location fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the information about case marking in Southeastern Pomo can be summarized as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions various suffixes that indicate grammatical relations, such as subject, object, and locative.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses suffixes used to indicate possession and locative cases.
3. **Paragraph 8** provides examples of different case suffixes, including subject, object, and possessive cases.
4. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** mention the use of suffixes for dual and plural forms, which may also be relevant to case marking.
5. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss transformations and suffixes related to verb forms, which might indirectly indicate case relations.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Southeastern Pomo uses a system of suffixes to mark different grammatical relations, including subject, object, possessive, and locative cases. This suggests that the language has a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Given the evidence of multiple distinct case markers (subject, object, possessive, locative), it is reasonable to conclude that Southeastern Pomo has a system of 4 cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of distinct suffixes for subject, object, possessive, and locative cases indicates a productive case system.
- The language does not appear to have an extensive number of cases beyond these four primary ones based on the provided information.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",6-7 cases,4 cases
Slave,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Slave, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, the language seems to rely heavily on pronouns and possessive markers to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. The examples provided focus on pronouns, possessive constructions, and verb agreement rather than on a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the major lexical categories including nouns, verbs, and postpositions, but does not mention any case-marking for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Focuses on pronouns and their syntactic and semantic roles, without indicating any case-marking for nouns.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Provides examples of pronoun usage and verb agreement, again without reference to noun case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses incorporated postpositions and their roles, but not noun cases.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions complementizers and adverbial elements, not noun cases.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Talks about classifiers and their semantic functions, not noun cases.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Describes the use of classifiers in verb forms, not noun cases.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses object nouns and pronouns in verb subcategorization, not noun cases.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions gender marking and thematic roles, not noun cases.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Describes verbs requiring direct objects and the use of incorporated postpositions, not noun cases.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses coreferentiality and possessive pronouns, not noun cases.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Talks about uninflected stems used as modifiers, not noun cases.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the precedence relation of nouns and pronouns, not noun cases.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Provides examples of coreferential interpretations within sentences, not noun cases.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses compounds and their formation, not noun cases.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Provides examples of coreference and command relationships, not noun cases.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Describes the use of classifiers in various verb forms, not noun cases.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses verb themes indicating number, not noun cases.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions complementizers and their usage, not noun cases.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Describes thematic roles and verb forms, not noun cases.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Squamish, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly mentions that Squamish has two case forms: Absolutive and Relative. The Absolutive case is unmarked, while the Relative case is marked by a prefix /t-/. The Absolutive case is used for subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs, while other relations appear in the Relative case.

2. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 7** further reinforce the use of Absolutive and Relative cases by providing examples and explanations of their syntactic roles. The Absolutive case is used for subjects and objects, while the Relative case is used for other nominal relations.

3. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss the use of articles and demonstratives in relation to the case system, but they do not introduce any additional cases beyond Absolutive and Relative.

4. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 19** discuss the use of possessive affixes and personal substitutes, which are relevant to the morphology but do not indicate additional cases beyond the two already mentioned.

5. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 20** discuss relator-verbs and their complements, which are marked by the Relative case, further supporting the two-case system.

6. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss the use of clitics and nominalizers, which again do not introduce additional cases beyond Absolutive and Relative.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Squamish has a productive case paradigm with two cases: Absolutive and Relative.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, the language exhibits the following case-marking system:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the determinative category of nouns is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
3. **Paragraph 5** provides further details on the three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
4. **Paragraph 6** describes the usage of nouns in the non-definitive and locative cases, providing examples of their syntactic roles.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Tunica has a productive case system with three distinct cases: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

**Reasoning:**
- The definitive case is marked by gender-number suffixes.
- The non-definitive case does not use inflectional suffixes and can be singular or plural based on context.
- The locative case is marked by one of three locative suffixes and can also be singular or plural based on context.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is challenging to determine the exact number of productive case paradigms of nouns in Washo. However, we can analyze the information given to make an informed decision.

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions the contrast between Third Person Subjective and Objective pronouns, suggesting some form of case marking for subjects and objects. This implies at least a nominative-accusative distinction.
2. **Paragraph 11** discusses the derivation of adverbs from nouns, pronouns, and other adverbs using suffixed postpositions that have meanings of spatial position and other relationships. This suggests the presence of locative or other peripheral cases.
3. **Paragraph 18** mentions the semantic relationship of the verb to the noun differing from case to case, indicating the presence of multiple cases.

Given these points, it appears that Washo has some form of case marking, including at least nominative, accusative, and possibly locative or other peripheral cases. However, the exact number of cases is not explicitly clear from the provided paragraphs.

Considering the information about locative and other spatial relationships, it seems that Washo may have overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations, but there is no clear evidence of a full-fledged case system with a large number of cases.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wichita,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wichita, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses various roles such as agent, experiencer, and beneficiary but does not provide evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions pronouns and other grammatical elements but does not indicate a case system for nouns.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Talks about instrumental and other roles but does not provide clear evidence of a case system.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions locative and other forms but these appear to be specific to certain contexts rather than a general case system.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Does not provide relevant information about case marking.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses number and person distinctions but not case marking.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions various relationships like experiencer, beneficiary, and instrument but does not indicate a case system.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses verb forms and subject marking but does not provide evidence of a noun case system.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Talks about noun derivation and anthropomorphization but not about case marking.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses verb forms and subject marking but does not indicate a noun case system.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Mentions various grammatical elements but does not provide evidence of a case system.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses complex verb forms and structures but not a noun case system.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions dative and other forms in specific contexts but does not indicate a general case system.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses verbal participles but not noun case marking.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Talks about optative and other verb forms but not noun case marking.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses verb forms and subject marking but does not provide evidence of a noun case system.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Mentions imperative forms and objects but does not indicate a noun case system.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses noun phrase structure but not case marking.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions pronouns and general morphemes but not a noun case system.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses inflectional elements but not a noun case system.

From the analysis, it is clear that Wichita does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses other grammatical means such as word order, verb forms, and specific markers for roles like locative or instrumental in certain contexts.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Wintu by examining the morphological case-marking on nouns. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Lists object case suffix {um}, genitive case suffix {un}, locative case suffix {in}, instrumental case suffix {r}, and possessive case suffix {t}.
2. **Paragraph 2**: States that nouns are inflected for three morphological cases.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions that inalienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, possessive, and instrumental. Alienably possessed nouns use the genitive for possessive and instrumental functions.
4. **Paragraph 8**: Lists four case suffixes: object {um}, possessive {t}, instrumental {r}, and locative {in}.
5. **Paragraph 11**: States that alienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, genitive, and locative.
6. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions the object case suffix {um}.
7. **Paragraph 13**: States that nouns are inflected for one, two, or four morphological cases.
8. **Paragraph 14**: Mentions the genitive case suffix {un}.
9. **Paragraph 18**: Describes the genitive case suffix {un} and the locative case suffix {in}.

From these paragraphs, we can infer that Wintu has a productive case system with the following cases:
- Object (accusative)
- Genitive
- Locative
- Instrumental
- Possessive

This gives us a total of five distinct cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has explicit morphological markers for object, genitive, locative, instrumental, and possessive cases.
- These cases are used productively to mark nouns for their syntactic and semantic roles.

**Conclusion**: 5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Acoma,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the morphological case-marking in the Acoma language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph explicitly states that ""Nouns do not distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for a possessor, with distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession."" This is a strong indication that Acoma does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph mentions that ""Laguna marks two roles morphologically: actor and undergoer."" However, it does not specify that these roles are marked on nouns. Instead, it seems to refer to verbal morphology, which is common in languages with ergative-absolutive or active-stative alignment systems.

3. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of subject prefixes and their role in coding arguments in transitive and ditransitive verbs. It does not provide evidence of case-marking on nouns but rather on verbs.

4. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph describes possession being expressed through an appositional construction involving a nominalized verb stem, not through case-marking on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the use of actor and undergoer prefixes in verbs, again pointing to verbal morphology rather than nominal case-marking.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the positioning of nouns based on their activation status in discourse, which is a syntactic phenomenon rather than morphological case-marking.

7. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph mentions the possessive copula used with nouns and noun phrases, but it does not indicate case-marking on nouns.

8. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the marking of roles in PRMP prefixes on verbs, not on nouns.

9. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses quantifiers acting as pronouns or modifiers, without mentioning case-marking on nouns.

10. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph lists common quantifiers and their use, again without reference to case-marking on nouns.

Given the evidence from these paragraphs, it is clear that Acoma does not utilize morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on verbal morphology and syntactic positioning to indicate grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aleut, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ordinary nouns have suffixes for relational case (absolutive, relative).
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses adverbial cases, specifically mentioning locative and ablative.
3. **Paragraph 8** states that Aleut has two grammatical (relational) cases, absolutive and relative, and two local cases, locative and ablative.
4. **Paragraph 20** reiterates that positional nouns have one or two adverbial cases, locative and/or ablative.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Aleut has a total of four productive cases: absolutive, relative, locative, and ablative.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns in Barbareño Chumash. The language appears to use a variety of nominalizers and other morphological processes, but there is no mention of a system of morphological case-marking that would indicate different grammatical roles for nouns (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.).

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The paragraphs discuss various nominalizers (agentive, locative, instrumental, resultative) and other morphological processes like reduplication and tense marking on nouns.
   - There is no mention of a system where nouns change form based on their syntactic role in a sentence (e.g., subject, object).
   - The examples provided focus on derivational morphology rather than inflectional morphology related to case.
   - The discussion of pronouns and their marking does not extend to a broader case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Comanche,"### Reasoning:

1. **Objective Case**: The first paragraph provides clear evidence of an objective case in Comanche. It mentions various objective suffixes such as -@, -?a, -ha, -i, -e, and -ta. These suffixes are used to mark the objective case on nouns, indicating that Comanche has a productive system for marking the objective case.

2. **Subjective Case**: The second paragraph mentions subjective pronouns and their forms, indicating that Comanche distinguishes between subjective and objective cases. This is further supported by the mention of subjective case in the sixth paragraph, where it states that the subject is in subjective case in transitive sentences.

3. **Possessive Case**: The third paragraph lists possessive pronouns and mentions possessive forms of nouns, indicating that Comanche has a possessive case. This is further supported by the mention of possessive case in the seventh paragraph, where it discusses possessive morphology in detail.

4. **Additional Evidence**: The fifth paragraph mentions that many interrogative/indefinite pronouns are inflected for subjective, objective, and possessive cases, further supporting the presence of these three cases in Comanche.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided in the paragraphs, Comanche has a productive system for marking at least three cases: subjective, objective, and possessive.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",3 cases,3 cases
Kiowa,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the information about case marking in Kiowa is somewhat scattered and indirect. However, there are a few key points that can be deduced:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: Paragraph 1 discusses possessive constructions, indicating that possession is marked by prefixes. This suggests a morphological strategy for indicating possession, which is a common function of genitive case in many languages.

2. **Pronominal Prefixes**: Paragraphs 3, 7, and 11 mention pronominal prefixes that indicate the roles of participants in actions, such as agents, patients, and objects. This implies that Kiowa uses pronominal prefixes to mark grammatical relations, which can be seen as a form of case marking, although it is not explicitly stated as such.

3. **Locative and Instrumental Marking**: Paragraph 4 mentions locative expressions and the use of specific suffixes for locative meanings. This indicates that there is some form of morphological marking for locative relations.

4. **Inverse Marking**: Paragraphs 8 and 19 discuss inverse marking, which is related to the number and animacy hierarchy in the language. This is not directly related to case marking but shows a complex system of marking grammatical relations.

5. **Absence of Explicit Case Paradigms**: Throughout the paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a full case paradigm for nouns, such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the focus is on pronominal prefixes and specific suffixes for possession and locative meanings.

Given this information, it appears that Kiowa does not have a fully productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on pronominal prefixes and specific suffixes for certain grammatical relations.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of pronominal prefixes indicates a system of marking grammatical relations, but this is not the same as a full case system for nouns.
- The mention of locative suffixes suggests some morphological marking for specific relations.
- The absence of a clear, productive case paradigm for nouns suggests that Kiowa does not have a traditional case system.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Yup'ik, we can deduce the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the localis, ablative-modalis, and terminalis cases.
2. **Paragraph 2** lists the absolutive and relative cases, and also mentions the ablative-modalis.
3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates the existence of the terminalis, localis, and ablative-modalis cases.
4. **Paragraph 6** discusses the localis case.
5. **Paragraph 7** mentions the terminalis case.
6. **Paragraph 10** discusses the ablative-modalis case.
7. **Paragraph 12** introduces the vialis and equalis cases.
8. **Paragraph 14** discusses the terminalis case.
9. **Paragraph 16** mentions the vialis and equalis cases again.
10. **Paragraph 18** discusses the ablative-modalis case.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases:
- Absolutive
- Relative
- Localis
- Ablative-modalis
- Terminalis
- Vialis
- Equalis

This gives us a total of 7 distinct cases. Since the number of cases falls within the range of 6-7, the appropriate option is:

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, the following observations can be made regarding the presence of morphological case-marking:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""Locative inflections prefixed to nouns,"" indicating the presence of locative case marking.
2. **Paragraph 9** discusses the use of prefixes in nouns standing as direct objects of verbs, which suggests some form of objective case marking.
3. **Paragraph 10** explicitly mentions ""Objective forms"" for pronouns, such as ""nekac"" and ""kelac,"" used when the pronoun stands as the object of a transitive verb.
4. **Paragraph 16** refers to ""Locative forms"" of pronouns, indicating a specific locative case.

The information provided indicates that Yurok has specific morphological markers for locative and objective cases. However, there is no mention of a broader or more extensive case system that includes nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, or other cases typically found in languages with rich case systems.

Given the evidence, Yurok appears to have overt marking primarily for locative and objective relations, which aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" as it involves concrete or peripheral case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that pronouns are inflected for number and case.
2. **Paragraph 2** describes subject, object, and possessive pronouns, indicating that these are distinct forms.
3. **Paragraph 5** provides a table of personal pronouns differentiated for subject, object, and possessive cases.
4. **Paragraph 10** states that nouns are inflected only for number (singular and plural), with no mention of case inflections for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 16** reiterates that nouns are inflected only for number (singular and plural).

From these points, it is clear that Zuni has distinct subject, object, and possessive forms for pronouns, but nouns themselves are not inflected for case. This suggests that case marking in Zuni is limited to pronouns and does not extend to a productive case paradigm for nouns.

### Reasoning:
- The grammar explicitly states that pronouns are inflected for case (subject, object, possessive).
- There is no evidence of a productive case system for nouns, as nouns are only inflected for number (singular and plural).

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Columbia-Wenatchi:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions that agents of transitive verbs appear in the ergative case, and agents of intransitive verbs appear in the absolutive case. This indicates the presence of at least two cases: ergative and absolutive.
   
2. **Paragraph 9** indicates that the agent functions as the subject of the clause and is in direct case, while the patient is in oblique case. This suggests the presence of a direct case and an oblique case.

3. **Paragraph 10** mentions that the locative is case-marked as the direct object, indicating the presence of a locative case.

4. **Paragraph 12** refers to the ergative argument being optionally marked by quirky case, which implies the presence of additional case marking beyond the basic ergative-absolutive system.

5. **Paragraph 19** states that in the indefinite object voice, the agent is in direct case, and the patient (if present) is also in direct case, while the goal is suppressed or realized as an adjunct. This reinforces the presence of a direct case and suggests the possibility of other cases for adjuncts.

6. **Paragraph 18** mentions that incorporated nouns are not marked for case, which implies that case marking is relevant for non-incorporated nouns.

From these points, we can infer that Columbia-Wenatchi has a system that includes at least ergative, absolutive, direct, oblique, and locative cases. This suggests a system with multiple cases, likely falling into the category of 5 cases.

### Reasoning:
- **Ergative case**: Mentioned explicitly for agents of transitive verbs.
- **Absolutive case**: Mentioned explicitly for agents of intransitive verbs.
- **Direct case**: Mentioned for agents and patients in certain constructions.
- **Oblique case**: Mentioned for patients in certain constructions.
- **Locative case**: Mentioned explicitly.

Given the explicit mention of these cases and the potential for additional quirky case marking, it is reasonable to conclude that Columbia-Wenatchi has a system of 5 cases.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Tlingit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tlingit, we can analyze the presence and nature of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - The nominal phrases functioning as subject (NPs), object (NPo), indirect object (NPi), and extension (NPe) are described.
   - NPs exhibit agreement with the pronominal subject prefix in the nuclear verb.
   - NPo exhibits agreement with the object pronominal in the nuclear verbal phrase.
   - NPi does not exhibit agreement with either.
   - NPe exhibits agreement with a possessive pronominal in a nominal, locative, or adverbial phrase of the clause.
   - NPs may be optionally followed by the subjectival syntactic marker -j, and obligatorily so when occurring with a transitive verb without pronominal subject prefix.

2. **Paragraph 12**:
   - The nominal phrase functioning as an object (NPo) is in agreement with the object pronominal word in the nuclear verbal phrase.
   - The nominal phrase functioning as an indirect object (NPi) is never in agreement with either a subject pronominal prefix in the verb or an object pronominal word in the verbal phrase or with a possessive pronominal.
   - The nominal phrase functioning as an extension (NPe) is in agreement with a possessive pronominal word in a nominal, locative, or adverbial phrase of the clause.

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Multiple occurrences of the nominal phrase functioning as subject or object, and of the locational adverbial phrase, are relatively frequent.
   - Locational adverbial phrases cooccur more frequently than any other phrases.

4. **Paragraph 16**:
   - Dubitative postmarginals occur with the semantic function of casting doubt over the whole clause.
   - Emphasis is shown by the use of phrase marginals, change of phrase order, and repetition.

5. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Extensors and their inflectional uses are described, indicating the presence of inflectional morphology in verbs.

6. **Paragraph 18**:
   - Included clauses may be termed 'direct speech' and are subordinate to a group of 'speech verbs'.
   - Any independent clause type may occur as an included clause in this case.

### Analysis:

The information provided indicates that Tlingit uses pronominal agreement and syntactic markers to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich system of nominal case inflections. The presence of pronominal prefixes and suffixes, as well as syntactic markers like -j, suggests that the language relies more on these elements for indicating grammatical roles.

The descriptions do not provide evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns that would indicate a system of multiple morphological cases. Instead, the agreement patterns and syntactic markers seem to play a more significant role in the language's grammar.

### Conclusion:

**No morphological case-marking**

The evidence suggests that Tlingit does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns, and instead uses pronominal agreement and syntactic markers to indicate grammatical relations.",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, the following observations can be made regarding case-marking:

1. **Obviation**: The language has a system of obviation, which marks nouns as either proximate (central to the discourse) or obviative (distanced from the speaker's focus). This is a common feature in Algonquian languages and is used to distinguish between different third-person referents within the same clause or discourse. However, obviation is not typically considered a grammatical case in the traditional sense (nominative, accusative, etc.).

2. **Possession**: The language marks possession on the possessed noun rather than the possessor. For example, ""npihtin"" (my hand) and ""kpihtin"" (your hand) show possessive inflection on the noun. This is a morphological feature but does not constitute a separate grammatical case.

3. **Locative**: There are locative forms for nouns, such as ""wikuwamok"" (in, on, at the house) and ""wikuwamihkuk"" (in, on, among the houses). This indicates a locative case, which is a concrete or peripheral case relation.

4. **Absentative**: There are absentative forms of nouns, which indicate the absence of the noun in time or space. This is a specific morphological marking but does not align with traditional grammatical cases.

5. **No Evidence of Core Cases**: There is no mention of nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive cases in the traditional sense. The language uses other means, such as word order and verb inflection, to indicate grammatical relations.

Given these observations, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet does not have a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative, etc.). Instead, it uses obviation, possession, and locative marking, which are more aligned with peripheral or concrete case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs, Tsimshian (Coast) exhibits the following characteristics related to case-marking:

1. **Ergative-Absolutive Alignment**: The language distinguishes between ergative and absolutive cases. The ergative case marks the subject of transitive verbs, while the absolutive case marks the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs. This is evident from multiple paragraphs (e.g., Paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 10, 14, 16, 17).

2. **Possessive Marking**: There is a possessive construction that involves enclitics or suffixes, which can be considered a form of genitive case marking (Paragraph 12).

3. **No Mention of Additional Cases**: There is no clear evidence of other cases such as dative, locative, instrumental, etc., in the provided text. The focus is primarily on ergative, absolutive, and possessive (genitive) constructions.

Given these observations, Tsimshian (Coast) appears to have a productive case paradigm with three cases: ergative, absolutive, and genitive.

**Reasoning**:
- The ergative case is used for the subject of transitive verbs.
- The absolutive case is used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.
- The genitive case is used for possessive constructions.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nahuatl (Tetelcingo), the language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, the language relies heavily on pronominal affixes and other morphological markers to indicate grammatical relationships, such as possession, subject, and object. There is no evidence of a systematic case-marking system for nouns that would align with the traditional concept of grammatical cases like nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

Here is the reasoning for this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the use of possessor pronouns and subject prefixes, but does not indicate a case system for nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions epenthesis and vowel harmony but does not relate to case marking.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Talks about pronominal subjects and objects marked on verbs, not nouns.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Describes possessive constructions and adjective placement, with no mention of case marking.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Focuses on pronouns and their use for emphasis and topicalization, not case marking.
6. **Paragraph 7**: Describes incorporated elements indicating positions, but these are not cases.
7. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses syntax and quantifiers, with no mention of case marking.
8. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions verb forms and applicatives, not noun case marking.
9. **Paragraph 10**: Describes number agreement and reduplication, not case marking.
10. **Paragraph 11**: Talks about verb structure and object marking, not noun cases.
11. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses topicalization and word order, not case marking.
12. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions verb structure and object marking, not noun cases.
13. **Paragraph 14**: Describes prepositions and locative constructions, which could be considered borderline case-marking but are not part of a productive case system.
14. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses plural forms and absolutive marking, not a case system.
15. **Paragraph 16**: Talks about object complement clauses and verb forms, not noun cases.
16. **Paragraph 17**: Describes verb forms and applicatives, not noun cases.
17. **Paragraph 18**: Lists various grammatical abbreviations and terms, not specific to case marking.
18. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions honorifics and object marking on verbs, not noun cases.
19. **Paragraph 20**: Describes adjective placement and possessive constructions, not case marking.

Given the lack of evidence for a productive case paradigm for nouns and the reliance on other morphological markers, the appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Abkhaz does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on pronominal affixes and relational particles within the verbal complex to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles. Here is the reasoning for this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses pronominal affixes used in association with postpositions and possessive constructions, but does not mention any case-marking on nouns themselves.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions the use of pronominal affixes and relational particles to indicate functions of the noun, but again, no explicit case-marking on nouns is described.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Highlights the use of bound affixes within the verbal complex to mark subjects and objects, rather than case-marking on nouns.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses possessive constructions and the use of pronominal prefixes, but no mention of case-marking on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions predicative case-forms, but these are not productive case paradigms for nouns in the traditional sense.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Describes the use of pronominal affixes and relational particles within the verbal complex, not case-marking on nouns.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses reciprocal pronouns and possessive constructions, but no case-marking on nouns.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Talks about number-marking and predicative case, but not productive case paradigms for nouns.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions emphatic pronouns and suffixes, but no case-marking on nouns.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses pitch and clause structure, not case-marking.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Talks about verbal affixes and particles, not case-marking on nouns.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Describes verbal nouns and masdars, not case-marking on nouns.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses number-marking and adjectives, not case-marking on nouns.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Talks about plural markers and adjectives, not case-marking on nouns.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Describes predicative case and copula constructions, not productive case paradigms for nouns.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions predicative case in specific constructions, not a general case system.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses pronominal affixes and negative particles, not case-marking on nouns.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Talks about plural markers and numerals, not case-marking on nouns.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions interrogative pronouns and adverbial forms, not case-marking on nouns.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Describes deverbal nouns and pronominal affixes, not case-marking on nouns.

Given the consistent absence of any mention of a productive case-marking system for nouns across these paragraphs, it is clear that Abkhaz does not use morphological case-marking for nouns in the traditional sense.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Eastern Armenian, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns:

1. **Nominative (NOM)**: Zero ending, unmarked.
2. **Dative (DAT)**: Ends in {-i}, {-u}, {-an}, {-a}, {-o}, {-oj}, {-va}, or {-c}.
3. **Ablative (ABL)**: Ends in {-ic}.
4. **Instrumental (INST)**: Ends in {-ov}.
5. **Locative (LOC)**: Ends in {-um}.

These cases are explicitly mentioned and described in terms of their endings and functions. There is no mention of additional cases that would increase the count beyond these five.

### Reasoning:
- **Nominative (NOM)**: Used for subjects, direct objects (non-person), adverbial modifiers of location and time, complements of the copula, and vocatives.
- **Dative (DAT)**: Used for adnominal attributes, direct objects (persons), complements of addressees or beneficiaries, and adverbial modifiers of location and time.
- **Ablative (ABL)**: Used for complements of verbs of negative emotion, removal, partitive objects, agents in passive constructions, bases of comparison, adverbial modifiers of cause, location, and time.
- **Instrumental (INST)**: Used for complements of verbs of contact, filling, occupation, instruments, concomitant objects, agents in passive constructions, and adverbial modifiers of manner, route, time, and cause.
- **Locative (LOC)**: Used for the second valency of verbs of residence and as adverbial modifiers of place and time.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",5 cases,5 cases
Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Lists various case forms for personal pronouns, including absolutive, ergative, dative, genitive, benefactive, comitative, instrumental, locative, ablative, and allative.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the nature of nominal inflection and provides examples of case and number inflection in noun phrases, indicating that case is marked by suffixes.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Describes the functions of different case suffixes, including absolutive, ergative, dative, and others.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions local cases such as locative, ablative, allative, and compound cases formed on the allative.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Provides detailed paradigms of nominal inflection, listing various cases such as absolutive, ergative, dative, genitive, benefactive, comitative, instrumental, partitive, and local cases.

6. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses the genitive case and its forms, as well as the benefactive and comitative cases.

7. **Paragraph 15**: Mentions reflexive noun phrases and their case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the use of the verbal noun with various inflectional suffixes, including spatio-temporal case endings like allative and locative.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Basque:

- Absolutive
- Ergative
- Dative
- Genitive
- Benefactive
- Comitative
- Instrumental
- Locative
- Ablative
- Allative

Additionally, there are compound cases formed on the allative, such as directional, terminative, and destinative.

### Conclusion:
**10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Catalan, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in Catalan:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that first- and second-person object pronouns are undifferentiated for accusative (direct object) and dative (indirect object) functions. This suggests that Catalan does not have distinct morphological case markings for these functions in pronouns.
   
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the positioning of weak object pronouns before the verb and provides examples of object pronouns in various contexts. This indicates that Catalan uses clitic pronouns for object marking rather than distinct case endings on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 13** elaborates on the use of third-person indirect object pronouns and mentions that the same forms are used for both masculine and feminine indirect objects. It also notes the use of colloquial variants but does not indicate distinct case endings for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 14** describes pronominal verbs and the use of reflexive pronouns, which are not indicative of a productive case system for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 20** states that personal pronouns have unstressed (clitic) direct object forms distinct from subject forms, but other noun phrases generally take no special form as direct objects. This implies that Catalan does not use morphological case marking for nouns.

From the information provided, it is clear that Catalan relies on clitic pronouns and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than using distinct morphological case endings on nouns. Therefore, Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Western Frisian, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 2** states that ""Except for the plural ending, nouns in Frisian are essentially undeclined. There are a few isolated holdovers from an earlier case system, but these are insignificant in the language today."" This indicates that Frisian does not have a productive case system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""Certain relics of a more elaborate case system in the articles have survived into the modern language."" This suggests that while there are remnants of a case system, they are not productive and are limited to specific phrases and contexts.

3. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 4** discuss pronouns and their forms, indicating distinctions between subject and object pronouns, but this does not extend to a productive case system for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 11** further elaborate on pronoun usage, showing distinctions in pronouns for different grammatical roles, but again, this does not imply a productive case system for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 20** discuss sentence structure and verb usage, which do not indicate any productive case-marking for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 19** mentions reflexive pronouns and the use of -sels for emphasis, but this is related to pronouns and not to a productive case system for nouns.

From these observations, it is clear that Western Frisian does not have a productive case system for nouns. The remnants of an older case system are not significant in modern usage, and the grammatical roles of nouns are primarily indicated by word order and prepositions rather than by morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the following productive case paradigms in Korean:

1. **Nominative Case**: Marked by particles such as ""ka/i"".
2. **Accusative Case**: Marked by particles such as ""ul"".
3. **Genitive Case**: Marked by particles such as ""uy"".
4. **Dative Case**: Marked by particles such as ""eykey"".
5. **Locative Cases**: Including static locative (marked by ""ey"") and dynamic locative (marked by ""eyse"").
6. **Goal Case**: Marked by particles such as ""ey"" or ""kkey"".
7. **Source Case**: Marked by particles such as ""eyse"" or ""puthe"".
8. **Instrumental Case**: Marked by particles such as ""lo"".
9. **Directional Case**: Marked by particles such as ""lo"".

These cases are explicitly mentioned and described in the paragraphs, indicating that they are part of the productive case system in Korean. The descriptions also differentiate between syntactic cases (nominative, accusative, genitive) and semantic cases (dative, locative, goal, source, instrumental, directional), which are all marked by specific particles.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Latvian,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Latvian, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that traditionally, Latvian grammars have worked with a system of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative. However, it also mentions that the status of the instrumental case is questionable in modern Latvian, as it occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" and is identical in form with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural. The conclusion drawn in this paragraph, supported by references to other scholars, is that modern Latvian does not have a separate instrumental case, leading to a system of six cases.

2. **Paragraph 2** reiterates the functions of the cases and mentions the instrumental case's status, directing readers to another page for more details. This supports the idea that the instrumental case is not considered a separate productive case in modern Latvian.

3. **Paragraph 10** further supports the non-existence of a separate instrumental case by stating that the locative, nominative, and vocative cannot be governed by prepositions, and the instrumental case is not necessary due to its merger with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural.

4. **Paragraph 20** lists prepositions that govern various cases, including the genitive, accusative, and dative, but does not mention the instrumental case, reinforcing its non-existence as a separate case.

Given this information, the productive case paradigms of nouns in modern Latvian consist of six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and vocative.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

19. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of noun phrases and the use of cases in these structures.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses clausal adjuncts and the use of cases in these constructions.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Lezgian has a rich case system with a total of eighteen cases, including both grammatical and local cases. The grammatical cases are Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, and Dative. The local cases are divided into five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In), each with three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive), except for one missing combination.

### Conclusion:
**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Meithei,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Meithei as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides a table showing the inflectional paradigm of the noun 'male child' with the following cases: agentive/instrumental (-na), accusative (-pu), locative (-ta), ablative (-tegi), genitive (-ki), and associative (-ka). This indicates at least six distinct cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the genitive case (-ki) and mentions that it can be further marked by the locative or associative, showing compositional meaning. This reinforces the presence of the genitive case and its interaction with other cases.

3. **Paragraph 4**: Lists peripheral case markers: locative (-ta), instrumental (-na), associative (-ka), and ablative (-tagi). These are consistent with the cases mentioned in Paragraph 1.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the role of morphological case marking in indicating grammatical relations and mentions that Meithei marks noun phrases according to their semantic roles.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Clarifies the distinction between the agentive case (-na) and a homophonous contrastive marker (-nd), emphasizing that -na is a true case marker.

6. **Paragraph 7**: Provides a table of argument types and their corresponding case markers, confirming the presence of agentive (-na), patient (-pu), and other roles marked by cases.

7. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions that arguments in nominalization are not singled out for special case marking, implying that the case system is consistent across different syntactic structures.

8. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the ambiguity between the agentive and contrastive markers, emphasizing the functional role of case markers in disambiguating arguments.

9. **Paragraph 14**: Mentions that semantic role markers can be omitted or replaced by pragmatic markers, but this does not negate the existence of the core cases.

10. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the co-occurrence of determiners and case markers, reinforcing the presence of a structured case system.

11. **Paragraph 16**: Provides examples of possessive pronouns formed with the genitive case (-ki), further supporting the genitive case's role.

12. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the replacement of semantic role markers by pragmatic markers, but this is a secondary feature and does not affect the core case system.

13. **Paragraph 18**: Lists gender and number markers, which are separate from the case markers, indicating that the case system is distinct and productive.

14. **Paragraph 19**: Provides additional examples of derivational morphology, which is separate from the inflectional case system.

From the analysis, it is clear that Meithei has a productive case-marking system with at least six distinct cases: agentive/instrumental, accusative, locative, ablative, genitive, and associative. This fits into the category of ""6-7 cases.""

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mundari,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Mundari does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns. The language relies heavily on word order and postpositional phrases to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships, rather than inflectional case markers.

Key points supporting this conclusion include:

1. **Paragraph 12** explicitly states that Mundari is not an inflectional language and that both the subject and object of a sentence are morphologically unmarked for case. The syntactic roles are determined by word order.
2. **Paragraph 9** discusses postpositions that function as adverbials, indicating that relational meanings are expressed through postpositional phrases rather than case inflections.
3. **Paragraph 5** provides examples of possessive constructions and other semantic functions being expressed through suffixes and postpositions, not through a system of nominal cases.
4. **Paragraph 13** mentions number marking on nouns but does not indicate any case marking.

Given this information, it is clear that Mundari does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Nivkh,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** lists several case markers, including nominative, dative/accusative, comparative, locative, ablative, additive, limitative, and instrumental.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that there are 8 cases in one dialect and 7 cases in another dialect of Nivkh.
3. **Paragraph 4** mentions the forms of the dative/accusative and the comparative being considered as case forms.
4. **Paragraph 7** discusses postpositions that can take case suffixes, indicating a productive case system.
5. **Paragraph 17** reiterates that postpositions can take case suffixes, further supporting the presence of a case system.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Nivkh has a productive case system with multiple cases. Specifically, the grammar mentions 8 cases in one dialect and 7 in another, which aligns with the ""6-7 cases"" category.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Tati (Southern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Tati, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It explicitly mentions that Eshtehardi, a Southern Tati dialect, has a clear system of two cases: direct and oblique. This system is extended to both genders and numbers.

2. **Paragraph 4**: It states that nominal declension in Southern Tati presents a system of at least two cases, direct and oblique.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the use of the direct and oblique cases in various functions, such as the subject, vocative, agent, and objects of verbs and postpositions. This reinforces the presence of two cases.

4. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions the use of direct and oblique cases for personal pronouns, further supporting the two-case system.

5. **Paragraph 10**: Describes the use of the oblique case for definite direct objects under certain conditions, again indicating the presence of two cases.

6. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses the use of postpositions that create case-like forms but clarifies that these are not true case endings, reinforcing that the primary case system consists of two cases.

7. **Paragraph 17**: States that the genitive is generally expressed in the oblique case, which fits within the two-case system.

8. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions the use of oblique personal pronouns in various functions, including as possessive pronouns and adjectives, which aligns with the two-case system.

Turkish,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkish, we can determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in Turkish. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph is crucial as it explicitly lists the cases recognized by traditional Turkish grammarians: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, and genitive. It also provides the suffixes for these cases and examples of their usage. This indicates that Turkish has at least six cases.

2. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions that demonstrative pronouns use the same suffixes as nouns to express various cases, reinforcing the idea of a consistent case system.

3. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses irregular forms of cases in pronouns, indicating that the case system is applied to pronouns as well, with some variations.

4. **Paragraph 3**: States that the regular case system applies to pronouns just as it does to regular nouns, further confirming the presence of a systematic case paradigm.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Indicates that possessive pronouns can be marked for all the cases found in the language, suggesting a comprehensive case system.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that the markers for cases are the same for pronouns and nouns, with some differences in postpositional objects, which again points to a consistent case system.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the nominative and genitive cases in detail, providing examples of their usage in different syntactic contexts.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Explains that the morphological marking of noun phrases is essentially the same for finite and nominalized verbs, including accusative marking for direct objects.

9. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions the instrumental ""clitic"" and its free morpheme counterpart, ile, which is not recognized as a case marker by most traditional grammars. This suggests that the instrumental is not considered a core case in the traditional sense.

10. **Paragraph 14**: Provides examples of adjectives assigning oblique cases (dative and ablative) to their objects, reinforcing the presence of these cases.

11. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the use of accusative and genitive suffixes, indicating their role in marking specific and non-specific noun phrases.

12. **Paragraph 18**: Provides a table of case suffixes for the interrogative pronoun hangi, listing nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and ablative cases.

13. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions the retention of original case markers in nonfinite clauses, including the accusative case.

From the above analysis, it is clear that Turkish has a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, and genitive. There is no indication of additional cases beyond these six core cases in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases

Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

1. **Oblique Markers and Peripheral Relations**:
   - Paragraph 3 discusses oblique markers in Apurinã, which attach to nouns or pronouns to indicate peripheral grammatical relations, typically marked by adpositions in other languages. These markers are phonologically attached to their host base and resemble case-marking affixes in function and form. This suggests that Apurinã uses markers for peripheral relations rather than a full-fledged case system.

2. **Oblique Noun Phrases**:
   - Paragraph 4 elaborates on oblique noun phrases (NPobl), which consist of nominal forms marked with oblique markers. These markers attach to the rightmost noun or pronoun in a phrase, indicating relations like association or goal. The examples show that these markers are essential for indicating peripheral relations, reinforcing the idea that Apurinã uses specific markers for such functions.

3. **Subject/Possessor Pronominal Markers**:
   - Paragraph 5 describes subject/possessor pronominal markers that attach to nouns to indicate possession or to verbs to indicate the subject. These markers inflect for number, person, and gender, but there is no mention of a broader case system for marking syntactic roles beyond possession and subject marking.

4. **Special Bound Formatives**:
   - Paragraph 15 discusses various special bound formatives, including oblique markers, which attach to different word categories. The oblique markers are highlighted as attaching to noun bases and indicating peripheral relations, further supporting the notion that Apurinã uses specific markers for peripheral relations rather than a comprehensive case system.

5. **General Syntactic Properties of Nouns**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that nouns in Apurinã can take possession/unpossession markers, but there is no indication of a broader case system. The discussion focuses on possession marking as a distinctive syntactic property of nouns.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The evidence from the provided paragraphs consistently points to the use of specific markers for peripheral relations, such as oblique markers, rather than a full-fledged case system. These markers indicate relations like association or goal but do not constitute a comprehensive case paradigm for marking syntactic roles across the board.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system of Awa Pit as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions that ""o can sometimes be marked by other cases,"" indicating the presence of case-marking but not specifying the number of cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the possessive marker ""pa"" and special accusative forms for personal pronouns, indicating the presence of at least possessive and accusative cases.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Provides details about accusative suffixes for singular personal pronouns and accusative clitics for plural personal pronouns, reinforcing the presence of an accusative case.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the accusative marker ""ta"" used for referential human noun phrases acting as objects or second objects, confirming the accusative case.

5. **Paragraph 7**: Shows examples of accusative marking on personal pronouns, further confirming the accusative case.

6. **Paragraph 9**: States that personal pronouns have special accusative forms, indicating a clear distinction between nominative and accusative cases.

7. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions a special suffix for the accusative case for the interrogative pronoun ""min,"" reinforcing the presence of an accusative case.

8. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses core grammatical relations and mentions that accusative case marking is used for objects and second objects, indicating a nominative-accusative system.

9. **Paragraph 16**: Confirms that objects and second objects have accusative case marking if they are referential and human.

10. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses postpositional phrases and mentions that the accusative marker is treated as a case marker, indicating a clear distinction between grammatical relations and semantic roles.

11. **Paragraph 20**: States that Awa Pit is a nominative-accusative language both morphologically and syntactically, with NPs in A (agent) and S (subject) functions marked the same way, distinctly from O (object).

From these paragraphs, it is evident that Awa Pit has a nominative-accusative case system with at least nominative and accusative cases. Additionally, the possessive marker ""pa"" suggests the presence of a genitive case. However, there is no clear evidence of more than these three cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive).

### Conclusion:
3 cases",10 or more cases,3 cases
Barasano,"To determine the number of cases in Barasano, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any mention of productive case paradigms of nouns.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Barasano has four morphemes that mark case, though not obligatorily:
     - **-re**: Marks object, experiencer, benefactee, and manner.
     - **-réka**: Marks accompaniment and instrument.
     - **-h#**: Marks locations or times.
     - **-ya**: Marks the genitive.

2. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Confirms the use of **-ya** for genitive constructions.

3. **Paragraph 11**:
   - Reiterates the use of **-re** for objects and thematic importance in discourse.

4. **Paragraph 19**:
   - Details the genitive marker **-ya** and its suffixes for indicating the possessed.

5. **Paragraph 13**:
   - Provides examples of **-re** marking objects in interrogative pronouns.

6. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Discusses nominalizers and their use in forming nominalizations, but this is not directly related to case marking.

### Reasoning:

- **-re**: Marks multiple roles including object, experiencer, benefactee, and manner.
- **-réka**: Marks accompaniment and instrument.
- **-h#**: Marks locations or times.
- **-ya**: Marks the genitive.

These markers indicate that Barasano has a system of case marking that includes:
1. Object (accusative-like)
2. Experiencer
3. Benefactee
4. Manner
5. Accompaniment
6. Instrument
7. Location (locative)
8. Time (temporal)
9. Genitive (possessive)

Given the information, Barasano has a productive case system that includes at least nine distinct cases. However, since some of these cases (like manner, accompaniment, and instrument) might be considered more peripheral or semantic, the most appropriate classification would be ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Epena Pedee,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Epena Pedee, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Ergative Case**: The ergative suffix -a is used with singular pronouns and the marked plural pronoun. Examples include ""mi-anaé-ma_pi-dtee-it'ée-da_a-hi_burrito"" (I-ERG this-LOC you-DAT give-FUT-DECL say-PST donkey) and ""josé-pa"" (José-ERG).
   
2. **Absolutive Case**: The absolutive case is not marked overtly. It is usually the first noun phrase to the left of the verb in a simple SOV clause. Examples include ""¢ik’é-ra"" (many fish) and ""imama"" (tiger).

3. **Dative Case**: The dative case is indicated by -md-a, -a, or simply vowel lengthening and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase. Examples include ""nawe-ma-a"" (mother-LOC-DAT) and ""soo-a"" (whip-DAT).

4. **Instrumental Case**: The clitic -pa is used to mark the instrument. Example: ""josé-pa"" (José-ERG) in ""josé-pa mi biiri thu-t'aa-hi_nek""6-pa"" (José cut my foot with a machete).

5. **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by -ma-a or -a. Examples include ""juancito Ce-ru-ma-a"" (Juancito come-PRES-LOC-DAT) and ""apemda-ra tomia-ma-a"" (Other-PL week-LOC-DAT).

6. **Benefactive/External Goal Case**: The clitic -it’ée marks noun phrases as benefactive and noun phrases or adjectives as an external goal. Examples include ""jose-Pit'ée"" (José-for) and ""mi-?ittée"" (me-for).

Given these observations, Epena Pedee has a productive case system that includes at least six distinct cases: ergative, absolutive, dative, instrumental, locative, and benefactive/external goal.

### Reasoning:
- **Ergative**: Marked by -a for singular pronouns and some plural pronouns.
- **Absolutive**: Not overtly marked but identifiable by position.
- **Dative**: Marked by -md-a, -a, or vowel lengthening.
- **Instrumental**: Marked by -pa.
- **Locative**: Marked by -ma-a or -a.
- **Benefactive/External Goal**: Marked by -it’ée.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Hixkaryana,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the case-marking system in Hixkaryana:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses various prefixes and their forms in different contexts, but does not provide clear evidence of a case system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that nominal subjects are optional and take the same forms as subjects of intransitive verbs. It also states that the subject nominal in a copular sentence is optional and takes the same form as the subject of an intransitive verb. This suggests that there is no distinct morphological case marking for subjects.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Indicates that the subject of an underlying transitive verb surfaces as a postpositional phrase with the noun followed by ""wya"" (normally an indirect object marker). The direct object of an underlying transitive and the subject of an underlying intransitive are marked in the same way as possessors in noun phrases. This suggests the use of postpositions rather than morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the use of prefixes to mark person and number in verbs, but does not mention any morphological case marking for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions the use of the relator ""xe"" for expressing desiderative functions, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

6. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses various sentence structures and the use of particles, but does not mention morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses collective forms and agreement in verbs, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

8. **Paragraph 9**: Describes nominalizations and derived forms, but does not mention morphological case marking.

9. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses word order and the use of prefixes in verbs to mark person and number, but does not mention morphological case marking for nouns.

10. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the structure of copular sentences and the use of postpositional phrases, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

11. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions pronoun-noun constructions and the use of pronouns, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

12. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions deletion of subject and direct object nominals, with person being marked in the verb prefix, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

13. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the use of free pronouns and postpositional phrases, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

14. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the use of denominalizers and postpositional phrases, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

15. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses the incorporation of body-part nouns and the use of prefixes, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

16. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the use of ideophones and the structure of sentences, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

17. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses equative sentences and the use of postpositional phrases, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

18. **Paragraph 19**: References external works, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

19. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses numerals and clitics, but does not provide evidence of a case system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, Hixkaryana does not exhibit a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositional phrases and verb prefixes to indicate grammatical relations.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Paumarí,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, the language exhibits the following case-marking features:

1. **Ergative Case**: The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the enclitic -a 'ERG' (Paragraphs 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19).
2. **Accusative Case**: The object of a transitive verb is marked with the enclitic -ra 'OBJ' (Paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 19).
3. **Demoted Object Case**: In ditransitive constructions, the indirect object is marked with -ra 'OBJ' and the direct object with -a 'DEMOT:O' (Paragraphs 11, 14).

These cases are used productively to mark syntactic roles in sentences, indicating a clear case-marking system. The presence of ergative, accusative, and demoted object cases suggests that Paumarí has a system of at least three distinct cases.

### Reasoning:
- **Ergative Case**: The ergative case is used to mark the subject of transitive verbs, as seen in multiple examples where the subject is marked with -a 'ERG'.
- **Accusative Case**: The accusative case is used to mark the direct object of transitive verbs, as indicated by the enclitic -ra 'OBJ'.
- **Demoted Object Case**: In ditransitive constructions, the indirect object is marked with -ra 'OBJ', and the direct object is marked with -a 'DEMOT:O'.

Given these observations, Paumarí has a productive case-marking system with at least three distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",3 cases,3 cases
Pirahã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Pirahã as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order. However, it does note the existence of morphological markers for oblique relations, specifically:
   - Instrumental case: marked by `-oal-ai`
   - Locative or general oblique case: marked by `-o`

2. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that oblique case is generally shown by the suffix `-o`. It also mentions that verbs do not treat indirect objects differently from other oblique objects, indicating a lack of distinct morphological case marking for indirect objects.

3. **Paragraph 17** provides an example of locative marking with the suffix `-o`.

4. **Paragraph 19** discusses the oblique suffix `-o` in the context of relative clauses, reinforcing its use within the VP.

From the information provided, it is clear that Pirahã uses specific morphological markers for oblique relations (instrumental and locative/general oblique). However, there is no evidence of a broader, productive case paradigm that includes nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive cases. The primary method of indicating grammatical relations is word order, with only peripheral cases being marked morphologically.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Quechua (Imbabura),"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Quechua (Imbabura), we can identify several case markers that indicate the presence of a productive case system. Here are the relevant points:

- **Accusative Case (-ta):** This is used to mark direct objects, as seen in examples like ""chay-ta"" (that-acc) and ""Marya-ta"" (Maria-acc).
- **Dative Case (-man):** This is used for indirect objects, as seen in ""Juzi-man"" (Jose-to).
- **Genitive Case (-paj):** This is used to indicate possession, as seen in ""pay-paj"" (he-of).
- **Locative Case (-pi):** This is used to indicate location, as seen in ""wasi-pi"" (house-in).
- **Ablative Case (-manda):** This is used to indicate the source, as seen in ""Agatu-manda"" (Agato-from).
- **Allative Case (-man):** This is used to indicate direction towards, as seen in ""wasi-man"" (house-to).
- **Instrumental Case (-wan):** This is used to indicate the means by which an action is performed, as seen in ""yunda-wan"" (pair of oxen-instrumental).

These examples indicate that Quechua (Imbabura) has a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: accusative, dative, genitive, locative, ablative, and instrumental. Additionally, the presence of the allative case further supports the complexity of the case system.

2. **Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Sanuma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sanuma, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the marker **-nd** which functions as a morphological ergative marker, marking the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses. It also mentions that nontransitive subjects and direct objects in transitive clauses are never marked.

2. **Paragraph 5** discusses the markers **niha/nihamé/ha/ham6** used for peripheral location constituents, comitative constructions, and marking roles such as noninstigational agent, instrument, and goal.

3. **Paragraph 8** provides examples of the agent marker **-nd** used in various contexts, including marking superordinate subjects in nontransitive clauses.

4. **Paragraph 9** further elaborates on the use of **-nd** and **kai** for marking superordinate and subordinate subjects, respectively.

5. **Paragraph 18** gives examples of clauses where the agent marker **-nd** is used to mark the subject in emotional or perceptional experience clauses.

From these points, we can deduce that Sanuma has a system of case-marking that includes:

- **Ergative case** marked by **-nd** for subjects of transitive and ditransitive clauses.
- **Peripheral cases** marked by **niha/nihamé/ha/ham6** for roles such as noninstigational agent, instrument, and goal.
- **Subordinate participant marker** **kai**.

Given this information, Sanuma does not have a large number of productive case paradigms but does have specific markers for certain syntactic and semantic roles. The presence of markers for peripheral roles and specific syntactic functions suggests that the language has a limited number of cases, primarily focusing on ergative and peripheral roles.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Shipibo-Konibo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Shipibo-Konibo by examining the case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 7** indicate that Shipibo-Konibo exhibits an ergative-absolutive pattern, where the ergative case is marked overtly, while the absolutive case is marked by zero. The ergative morpheme has various allomorphs and is used to mark ergative, genitive, instrumental, and locative/directional functions. This suggests that the language uses a single morpheme for multiple case functions, which is a common feature in some languages.

2. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the desiderative construction, where the case-marking of the subject changes from ergative to absolutive when the desiderative suffix -kas is added to a transitive verb. This indicates a productive case-marking system that can alter based on grammatical constructions.

3. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 10** further elaborate on the ergative-absolutive system, showing that the ergative case is used for subjects of transitive verbs and the absolutive case for objects of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.

4. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** mention additional case roles such as oblique, which are marked by specific pronouns and suffixes, indicating a more complex case system beyond just ergative and absolutive.

5. **Paragraph 7** also mentions that the ergative morpheme is used for genitive, instrumental, and locative/directional functions, suggesting that these are distinct cases in the language.

Given this information, Shipibo-Konibo appears to have a productive case-marking system with multiple cases, including ergative, absolutive, genitive, instrumental, and locative/directional. This aligns with the category of having 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several case markers: Ergative (-ek/-k), Dative (-etl/-tl, -ki, -es/-s), Allative (h)i’ta, Ablative (lots’), Instrumental (/etsi), Comitative (tam), and Locative (-n/-en). This indicates a productive case-marking system with multiple cases.

2. **Paragraph 6** lists the case markers again and adds the Genitive (-kate/-kte). This confirms the presence of at least eight distinct cases.

3. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 7** describe the Ergative-Absolutive alignment and the importance of Ergative, Absolutive, and Dative arguments in the language. This supports the presence of these cases as central to the grammatical structure.

4. **Paragraph 11** differentiates between case markers and postpositions, emphasizing that case markers are phonologically bound forms, while postpositions are free. This distinction helps clarify that the listed markers are indeed cases.

5. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the role of different cases in verb classes and argument marking, further supporting the presence of a robust case system.

6. **Paragraph 20** mentions the use of pluralizers and how case markers can indicate number, particularly in Dative NPs, reinforcing the productivity of the case system.

Given the evidence from these paragraphs, Trumai has a productive case-marking system with at least eight distinct cases: Ergative, Absolutive, Dative, Allative, Ablative, Instrumental, Comitative, Locative, and Genitive.

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in Urubú-Kaapor. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses noun modifiers and compound nouns but does not mention case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of genitive phrases and possessive forms, indicating possession but not necessarily case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses nominalizations and the use of -ha, -har, and me'e ke, which are nominalizers rather than case markers.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the basic word order (SOV) but does not provide information on case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses stative verbs and their prefixes, with no mention of case-marking.
6. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions the use of the postpositional relator rehe 'for, to', but this is not a productive case paradigm.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Warao,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the case system in Warao:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several case markers including DAT (dative), LOC (locative), ALL (allative), and ABL (ablative). It also states that case markers in Warao function primarily for peripheral constituents like indirect objects and adjuncts, conveying temporal and spatial meanings.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of ABL-marked and DAT-marked demonstratives, reinforcing the presence of these cases.

3. **Paragraph 3** gives examples of case markers in use, such as the dative marker ""-ta"" and the ablative marker ""-mo"".

4. **Paragraph 10** states that subjects and direct objects are not case-marked, indicating that the core grammatical relations (subject and direct object) do not have dedicated case markers.

5. **Paragraph 19** discusses the dative case in more detail, mentioning suffixes like ""-(i)si"", ""-ta"", and ""-ima"" for marking beneficiaries and indirect objects.

6. **Paragraph 20** elaborates on locative and ablative markers, providing examples of locative ""-te"" and ablative ""-mo"".

From these observations, it is clear that Warao has overt marking for peripheral case relations such as locative, allative, ablative, and dative. However, it lacks case marking for core grammatical relations like subject and direct object. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wari',"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in the Wari' language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that aside from possessive suffixes and a prefix for kinship terms, there are no other ways to directly mark noun functions on the noun. It also mentions a single preposition that marks the theme/patient NP when a goal is present and marks oblique objects to the verb.

2. **Paragraph 6**: Explicitly states, ""There is no case marking in the language.""

3. **Paragraph 7**: Reiterates that there is no distinction between subjects of transitive verbs as agent and nonagent, and no change in the form of the overtly expressed object when the subject is not overtly expressed.

4. **Paragraph 8**: States that there is no special inflection for nonfinite or nominalized verbs with regard to nominal grammatical function.

5. **Paragraph 12**: Confirms that there is no case marking, and the preposition does not govern case.

6. **Paragraph 17**: Clearly states, ""There is no case marking in the language.""

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, it is clear that Wari' does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The language relies on other means such as prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions genitive constructions where possessors precede the head noun, and Set I clitics can be used instead of full noun phrases. This indicates a genitive case marking but does not provide evidence of other cases.
   
2. **Paragraph 13** discusses postpositions and Set II clitics that mark direct objects. It also mentions specific postpositions like adlative, ablative, dative, and locative. These postpositions suggest the presence of locative and other peripheral cases but do not indicate a full case system for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

3. **Paragraph 17** describes Set I and Set II clitics used for subject and object reference, respectively. However, these clitics function more like agreement markers than true case markers.

4. **Paragraph 18** reiterates the use of Set I clitics for subjects and Set II clitics for objects, reinforcing the idea that these are agreement markers rather than morphological case markers.

5. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** do not provide additional information about case marking but focus on the pronominal system and the rarity of zero anaphora.

From the analysis, it is clear that Yagua uses clitics and postpositions to mark certain grammatical relations and roles. However, these do not constitute a full morphological case system. Instead, the language relies on clitics for subject and object marking and postpositions for locative and other peripheral roles.

**Reasoning:**
- The genitive construction is the only clear example of a case-like marking.
- The use of Set I and Set II clitics is more akin to agreement marking than true case marking.
- The presence of postpositions for locative and other roles suggests peripheral case marking but not a full productive case paradigm.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Hup as follows:

1. **Core Case Marking**:
   - **Nominative-Accusative Alignment**: The language exhibits a nominative-accusative alignment both morphologically and syntactically.
   - **Subject (S, A)**: Subjects of both transitive and intransitive clauses are unmarked (Ø).
   - **Object (O)**: Direct objects and other directly affected entities are marked with the suffix -a‡n, but this marking is subject to animacy and definiteness restrictions. Human objects are obligatorily marked, animal objects are optionally marked, and inanimate objects are unmarked.

2. **Oblique Case Marking**:
   - **Instrumental, Comitative, Locative**: These roles are marked with the suffix -Vêt.
   - **Directional**: Locative and allative/ablative roles are marked with an unstressed variant of the object marker -an.

3. **Differential Object Marking**:
   - The marking of objects depends on the animacy and definiteness of the noun. This is a form of differential object marking where human nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives are obligatorily marked, animals are optionally marked, and inanimates are unmarked.

4. **Summary of Case Markers**:
   - **Nominative**: Unmarked (Ø) for subjects.
   - **Accusative**: Marked with -a‡n for objects, subject to animacy and definiteness.
   - **Oblique**: Marked with -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and -an for directional roles.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Hup has a productive case-marking system with distinct markers for nominative, accusative, and oblique cases. The system includes:
- **Nominative (unmarked)**,
- **Accusative (-a‡n)**,
- **Oblique (-Vêt, -an)**.

This indicates that Hup has **3 cases**.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",4 cases,3 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Core Cases**:
   - Murui has a nominative-accusative case marking system for core arguments (S/A and O). The core arguments can be marked with topical enclitics: =dɨ for S/A and -na for O. Additionally, O arguments in the addressee function can be marked with the dative/locative -mo.
   - The marking of core cases is subject to differential case marking based on discourse status (topicality and specificity).

2. **Oblique Cases**:
   - Murui distinguishes five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative. These cases are used to mark non-core arguments and are generally mandatory.
   - The genitive form is mentioned but is not strictly considered a case as it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations.

3. **Summary and Table**:
   - The summary and tables provided in the paragraphs indicate that Murui has a clear distinction between core and oblique cases. The core cases include nominative and accusative, while the oblique cases include locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

4. **Case Marking System**:
   - The case markers are suffixes and are attached to the final element of an NP. Each NP takes a single case marker at a time, and oblique cases do not co-occur with core cases within a single NP.

From the information provided, it is clear that Murui has a productive case system with distinct core and oblique cases. The total number of cases, including both core and oblique, is seven:

- Core cases: nominative (S/A) and accusative (O).
- Oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

Therefore, the number of cases in Huitoto (Murui) is best categorized as:

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**

This conclusion is based on the presence of two core cases (nominative and accusative) and five oblique cases (locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative).",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no direct mention of morphological case-marking on nouns in Iquito. The paragraphs primarily discuss aspects of word order, verb inflection, and the behavior of pronouns and determiners in various syntactic environments. There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns that would indicate the presence of multiple grammatical cases.

### Reasoning:
1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses tense and aspect inflection on verbs, with no mention of noun case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions word order changes with indefinite subjects but does not discuss noun case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Describes elements that can appear in specific syntactic positions, including postpositional phrases, but does not indicate case-marking on nouns.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Shows word order patterns with pronouns and full noun phrases but does not mention case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses tense and aspect morphology in other languages, not relevant to noun case-marking in Iquito.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions grammatical tense and aspects in Iquito, not noun case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses disjunction and conjunction in sentences, not noun case-marking.
8. **Paragraph 8**: Describes word order in negative sentences, not noun case-marking.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Provides a detailed study of word order variations, not noun case-marking.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions the use of pronouns in sentences, not noun case-marking.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses derivational verbal morphemes, not noun case-marking.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses temporal schemata and situation types, not noun case-marking.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Talks about subject control in infinitival clauses, not noun case-marking.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Describes word order in complex verbal predicates, not noun case-marking.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the derivational morpheme -tii, not noun case-marking.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions pronominal objects in sentences, not noun case-marking.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Concludes that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO, not noun case-marking.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Discusses the coordinator cuquisaacari ‘probably’, not noun case-marking.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Mentions cliticization of determiners in irrealis clauses, not noun case-marking.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses future context and irrealis clauses, not noun case-marking.

### Conclusion:

Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""The only case distinction in Movima is made between structural and oblique case."" Structural case is unmarked and identifies core arguments, while oblique case is indicated by the prefix n- on the referential element. This indicates a clear distinction between two cases: structural (unmarked) and oblique (marked by n-).

2. **Paragraph 5** reiterates that Movima has only one “real” prefix, the oblique case marker n-. This supports the presence of an oblique case.

3. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** discuss the encoding of core arguments and the use of internal cliticization for marking the first transitive argument (ARG1) and possessors, but they do not introduce additional cases beyond the structural and oblique.

4. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 15** describe the use of oblique-marked pronouns and the conditions under which they are used, reinforcing the presence of an oblique case.

5. **Paragraph 16** mentions the use of the applicative marker -e in certain constructions, but this does not constitute a separate case marking system for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 17** and **Paragraph 18** discuss the structure of noun phrases and the use of articles and demonstratives, but do not introduce additional case distinctions.

7. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 3** provide examples of pronouns and their usage in different contexts, but do not indicate additional cases beyond the structural and oblique.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Movima has a clear distinction between two cases: structural (unmarked) and oblique (marked by n-). Therefore, the appropriate classification is:

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Apinayé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** discusses person prefixes used with verbs, nouns, and postpositions. It mentions an accusative prefix ""ku-"" used with transitive verbs and a zero prefix ""Ø-"" used across different word classes. However, this does not provide evidence of a full-fledged case system for nouns, as it focuses on person marking rather than case marking.

2. **Paragraph 2** describes the morphosyntactic classes of verbs and mentions that ergativity is expressed by case markers in subordinate clauses. This suggests the presence of ergative marking but does not detail a comprehensive case system for nouns.

3. **Paragraph 3** provides examples of ergative and accusative markers in verbs but does not elaborate on a broader case system for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the potential zero third person marker in certain predications but does not provide information on a productive case system for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 5** focuses on pronouns and demonstratives, indicating their roles and forms but not discussing a case system for nouns.

6. **Paragraph 6** shows examples of word order and the use of accusative prefixes in verbs, again not detailing a case system for nouns.

7. **Paragraph 7** provides examples of verb forms and their agreement with subjects and objects but does not discuss noun case marking.

8. **Paragraph 8** discusses determiners and their hierarchical structure within noun phrases but does not mention case marking.

9. **Paragraph 9** mentions the use of postpositions and reflexivization but does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.

10. **Paragraph 10** discusses imperatives and reflexivization, focusing on verb forms and their agreement with arguments rather than noun case marking.

11. **Paragraph 11** describes noun-noun compounds and the use of relational prefixes but does not indicate a case system for nouns.

12. **Paragraph 12** discusses noun modification and the structure of noun phrases, again without mentioning a case system for nouns.

13. **Paragraph 13** describes the use of subordination and the structure of clausal complements, mentioning ergative marking in subordinate clauses but not a broader case system for nouns.

14. **Paragraph 14** discusses imperatives and reflexivization, focusing on verb forms and their agreement with arguments rather than noun case marking.

15. **Paragraph 15** describes genitive constructions and the use of relational prefixes, indicating a genitive postposition ""õ"" but not a comprehensive case system for nouns.

16. **Paragraph 16** discusses noun modification and the juxtaposition of nouns without indicating a case system for nouns.

17. **Paragraph 17** mentions the genitive marker ""õ"" and its limited distribution, suggesting it is not a full-fledged case marker.

18. **Paragraph 18** describes postpositional phrases and the use of relational prefixes but does not provide evidence of a productive case system for nouns.

19. **Paragraph 19** discusses the use of independent pronouns and their forms in different clause types but does not mention a case system for nouns.

20. **Paragraph 20** describes noun derivation and the use of middle prefixes but does not indicate a case system for nouns.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that while Apinayé has some markers that could be considered as case markers (such as ergative and genitive markers), there is no evidence of a comprehensive and productive case system for nouns. The markers mentioned are limited in their distribution and do not form a full-fledged case paradigm.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

19. **Paragraph 19**: Provides examples of object marking in different semantic roles.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses the use of the object case marker =diʔ in ditransitive constructions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided, Kakua has a productive case-marking system for object arguments, marked by the case clitic =diʔ. Additionally, there are markers for locative, comitative/instrumental, and terminative roles. The language does not mark subject arguments with case but uses cross-referencing proclitics on the verb.

Given the presence of distinct markers for object, locative, comitative/instrumental, and terminative roles, Kakua has a system of at least four productive cases.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",4 cases,4 cases

Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case system of Camsá as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the genitive case and the benefactive case. The genitive case is marked by the suffix -be, and the benefactive case has different forms depending on the animacy of the noun (-am for inanimate nouns and -byam for animate nouns).

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that the nominal system of Kamsá includes case suffixes and postpositions. It also notes that many cases differ for animate and inanimate nouns, with animate nouns often having the suffix -bi before the case marker.

3. **Paragraph 3**: States that Kamsá has nine cases, all marked by suffixes.

4. **Paragraph 4**: Confirms that there is no core argument case marking (nominative and accusative) in Kamsá. Instead, there are various semantic case markers that are bound morphemes.

5. **Paragraph 5**: Provides examples of the benefactive case and mentions that it can be used with proper nouns and pronouns, indicating its productivity.

6. **Paragraph 6**: Lists the genitive case and provides examples of its use with various types of nouns.

7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the ablative case, which indicates motion away from a place or entity, and provides examples of its use.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions that pronouns in Kamsá can take various case markers, including genitive, allative, benefactive, and comitative.

9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the use of pronouns and their case marking, confirming that pronouns can take the same case markers as nouns.

10. **Paragraph 10**: Provides a summary of noun cases, listing the genitive, instrumental, comitative, benefactive, allative, locative, ablative, illative, and adessive cases.

11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the structure of noun phrases and confirms that case markers can appear at the end of the noun phrase.

12. **Paragraph 12**: Provides examples of noun phrases with case markers, confirming the use of various cases in different contexts.

14. **Paragraph 14**: Provides examples of noun phrases with determiners and case markers, confirming the use of case markers in different syntactic environments.

15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the use of pronouns as heads of noun phrases and their case marking.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Confirms that Kamsá encodes both subject and object on the verb and does not have different types of objects.

17. **Paragraph 17**: Provides examples of verb phrases with case-marked objects, confirming the use of various cases in different syntactic environments.

18. **Paragraph 18**: Provides examples of noun phrases with adjectives and determiners, confirming the use of case markers in different syntactic environments.

19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the agreement of other elements in a noun phrase with the head noun in terms of class, number, case, and evaluative markers.

20. **Paragraph 20**: Provides examples of pronouns with case markers, confirming the use of various cases with pronouns.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, it is clear that Camsá has a productive case system with multiple cases. The language has at least the following cases: genitive, instrumental, comitative, benefactive, allative, locative, ablative, illative, and adessive.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Kadiwéu:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Indicates that Kadiwéu has nominative and accusative cases for pronominals, with subjects in the nominative case and objects marked by a different set of pronominals.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions semantic role markers such as -d: ‘theme’, -gi ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -k ‘allative’, and -lokom ‘adessive’. These markers are described as semantic case suffixes.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Clarifies that -d: indicates a semantic role (theme) rather than a grammatical case, and it co-occurs with both nominative and accusative pronominals.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the use of the semantic case marker -d: ‘theme’ in certain contexts.
5. **Paragraph 8**: States that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic case morphology.
6. **Paragraph 9**: Provides examples of pronominal affixes or clitics co-occurring with semantic case markers like -wa ‘dative’, -dom ‘benefactive’, and -lokom ‘adessive’.
7. **Paragraph 14**: Reiterates that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements that assign semantic roles, and nouns do not co-occur with these semantic role assigners.
8. **Paragraph 15**: Lists the transitivizing morphemes that license grammatical arguments, including -d: ‘theme’, -gi ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -k ‘allative’, and -lokom ‘adessive’.

From these points, it is clear that Kadiwéu uses a set of semantic role markers that function similarly to cases but are specifically tied to pronominal clitics and affixes rather than nouns. These markers include roles like theme, goal, dative, benefactive, allative, and adessive, which are typically considered peripheral or semantic cases rather than core grammatical cases like nominative or accusative.

Given this information, Kadiwéu does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns but instead uses semantic role markers for pronominals. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions ""Relative case marks a syntactically dependent form; absolutive case marks an independent form."" This suggests the presence of at least two cases: relative (possibly ergative) and absolutive.

2. **Paragraph 2** lists various postpositions such as locative, ablative, instrumental, dative, allative, evitative, comitative, and comparative. These are not cases but postpositions, indicating that Karajá uses postpositions for many functions that other languages might use cases for.

3. **Paragraph 6** discusses the antipassive construction, which is typical of ergative languages. This implies that Karajá might have an ergative-absolutive alignment, further supporting the presence of at least two cases (ergative and absolutive).

4. **Paragraph 9** states that ""Core NP arguments—that is, subject and direct object—are not morphologically marked."" This indicates that there is no nominative-accusative case marking for core arguments.

5. **Paragraph 12** describes how postpositions are used to mark oblique arguments, such as locative, instrumental, and others. This suggests that while core arguments are not case-marked, oblique arguments are marked by postpositions.

6. **Paragraph 18** mentions clause nominalization and the use of stress shift to indicate subordinate status, but this does not provide additional information about case marking.

7. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 14** further elaborate on the use of postpositions for various functions, reinforcing the idea that Karajá uses postpositions rather than a rich case system.
