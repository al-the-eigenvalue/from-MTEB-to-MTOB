Maranungku,"To determine the number of cases in Maranungku, we need to identify the presence and productivity of case paradigms for nouns. Let's analyze the provided paragraphs for relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the benefactive case, which has different forms depending on whether the beneficiary is a noun or a pronoun. This indicates the presence of at least one case marker.
   
2. **Paragraph 9** describes the privative case, marked by ""nangara"" following the noun, similar to the benefactive case marked by ""nala."" This suggests another case marker.
   
3. **Paragraph 24** discusses accompaniment, marked by ""witya"" following the noun, indicating another case marker.
   
4. **Paragraph 29** mentions the instrument or agent phrase, marked by ""nunu"" following the noun, indicating another case marker.
   
5. **Paragraph 33** describes the cause, marked by ""yangana"" following the noun, indicating another case marker.
   
6. **Paragraph 44** describes the locative case, marked by ""yena"" following the noun, indicating another case marker.

From the analysis, we can identify at least six distinct case markers: benefactive, privative, accompaniment, instrument/agent, cause, and locative. This suggests that Maranungku has a productive case-marking system with at least six cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of multiple distinct case markers (benefactive, privative, accompaniment, instrument/agent, cause, locative) indicates a productive case-marking system.
- Each case marker is used to denote specific grammatical functions and relationships, which aligns with the definition of grammatical case.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, the language exhibits the following characteristics regarding case-marking:

1. **No morphological case-marking**: The text explicitly states that ""Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi."" This indicates that Tiwi does not use morphological case markers to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns within sentences. Instead, it relies on other means such as word order, context, and possibly other syntactic or morphological cues to convey these relationships.

2. **Possessor orientation**: The language uses juxtaposition without any case inflexion to indicate possession, as seen in examples like ""jarakapai tuwaua"" (the crocodile’s tail) and ""ijara tuwaua"" (his tail). This further supports the absence of morphological case-marking.

3. **Use of pronouns and context**: The language relies on pronouns and context to clarify relationships between nouns, as seen in the use of personal and possessive pronouns without inflection for case.

4. **No explicit mention of case paradigms**: Throughout the provided text, there is no mention of specific case paradigms or case markers being used productively in the language.

Given these observations, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Ungarinjin exhibits the following characteristics regarding case marking:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions two distinct cases marked by ""ra"": a locative and an instrumental agentive, with the latter occurring only on pronouns and proper nouns.
2. **Paragraph 4** states that nominal postpositions in Ungarinjin do not normally indicate grammatical case relations, and noun phrases cross-referenced on the verb do not ordinarily bear case postpositions.
3. **Paragraph 9** discusses locative clauses often occurring without case postpositions in positions where a noun phrase would demand one.
4. **Paragraph 11** indicates the use of a genitive postposition that sometimes serves a local function, akin to an ablative-elative counterpart to a lative.
5. **Paragraph 15** describes a postposition ""-gu"" serving some functions associated with the dative case in some Indo-European languages.
6. **Paragraph 17** distinguishes between grammatical and non-grammatical cases, with grammatical case relations signaled by cross-reference on the verb and non-grammatical cases signaled mainly by nominal postpositions.

From these points, it is clear that Ungarinjin has a system of case marking that includes at least the locative, instrumental agentive, genitive, and dative cases. However, the exact number of cases is not explicitly detailed beyond these examples. Given the information, it is reasonable to conclude that Ungarinjin has a productive case system with at least four distinct cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The language has explicit markers for locative, instrumental agentive, genitive, and dative cases.
- The presence of these markers indicates a productive case system rather than exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",8-9 cases,4 cases

   - Example: ""darranggu-mbili `stick-COMIT`.""

8. **Genitive Case**: This marks possession and agrees in gender with the possessed noun. It has forms like -nîganji, -niganya, and -niganka.
   - Example: ""bungma-nyi-niganka `old.man I GEN.IV`.""

9. **Proprietive Case**: This indicates possession or a characteristic and agrees in gender with the noun it modifies.
   - Example: ""darranggu-nguj `stick-PROP`.""

10. **Privative Case**: This indicates the absence of something and has forms like -yaja, -waja, and -baja.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"1. **Reasoning:**
   Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amharic, there is no clear evidence of a productive case system for nouns. The examples and discussions provided focus on various grammatical aspects such as verb conjugations, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions, but they do not indicate a systematic morphological case-marking paradigm for nouns. The references to object suffix pronouns and possessive suffixes suggest that relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence are primarily indicated through these suffixes rather than through distinct case endings.

2. **Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking

Berber (Middle Atlas),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the information relevant to determining the number of cases in Middle Atlas Berber can be summarized as follows:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the concept of ""state"" in Berber nouns, distinguishing between the ""normal state"" and the ""construct state."" The construct state is used in specific syntactic environments, such as after prepositions, as subject complements, and in certain verbal constructions. This indicates a form of morphological marking that affects the noun's form depending on its syntactic role.

2. **Paragraph 12** discusses noun phrases and possessive constructions, indicating that nouns can be in the construct state when followed by a complement noun or possessive pronoun. This further supports the presence of morphological changes in nouns based on syntactic context.

3. **Paragraph 31** confirms that all Berber common nouns are subject to marking of 'state,' reinforcing the idea that there is a morphological system in place that alters noun forms according to their syntactic function.

4. **Paragraph 43** provides examples of noun phrases with demonstrative suffixes and mentions that kinship nouns do not bear gender marks but are particular in their complementation syntax. This suggests that while there are morphological changes, they may not be extensive or numerous.

5. **Paragraph 44** describes noun-adjectives and their agreement in number and gender with the modified noun but not in state, indicating a specific morphological behavior tied to syntactic roles.

From the information provided, it is clear that Middle Atlas Berber employs a system of morphological changes to mark nouns based on their syntactic roles, particularly distinguishing between a normal state and a construct state. This system aligns with the concept of having two cases: one for the citation form (normal state) and one for specific syntactic environments (construct state).

Gimira,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, we can deduce the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that case is marked by suffixes added to the final element of the noun phrase or penultimate element when a final quantifier is present.
2. **Paragraph 2** describes the oblique case form, which functions as an object, a possessive pronoun, and in adverbial cases. It also mentions three forms of subject pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 4** lists suffixes that may replace the nominative or accusative case marker or be added to locative or ablative suffixes.
4. **Paragraph 12** indicates that nominative and accusative suffixes are obligatory when the noun is specific.
5. **Paragraph 23** provides examples of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative/benefactive, and locative cases.
6. **Paragraph 24** mentions the locative and nominative case markers affixed to determiners.
7. **Paragraph 25** discusses the placement of locative, accusative, ablative, and dative/benefactive phrases in clause structure.
8. **Paragraph 41** mentions the genitive marker as optional and provides examples of embedded noun phrases indicating possession, locative, and ablative meanings.

From these paragraphs, we can identify at least six cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, locative, ablative, and dative/benefactive. The presence of these cases suggests a productive case system with more than five cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases

Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that the category of case is present in Igbo grammar but is expressed differently, primarily through tonal relationships rather than morphological case markers.
2. **Paragraph 6** describes genitival relationships where tonal changes occur in both the genitive noun and the noun it follows, indicating a relationship rather than a morphological case marking.
3. **Paragraph 8** emphasizes that grammatical relations in Igbo are expressed by word order and tone rather than by inflectional morphology.
4. **Paragraph 9** further explains that nouns in genitival relationships change their inherent tones, which is a tonal rather than a morphological case marking system.
5. **Paragraph 19** discusses the expression of grammatical relations by word order and tone, with specific mention of genitival relationships being marked by tone and post-position rather than by morphological case markers.
6. **Paragraph 35** reiterates that grammatical relations, including genitival relationships, are expressed by tone and word order, not by morphological case markers.

From these observations, it is clear that Igbo does not use morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on tonal changes and word order to express grammatical relationships, including genitival relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can identify several case markers that are used productively in the language. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Construct Case Suffix**:
   - The construct case suffix is used when a noun is modified by another noun, an adjective, or a relative clause (Paragraph 2).
   - Example: ""Nouns that are modified by another noun, an adjective or a relative clause are in the construct case.""

2. **Adverbial Case Suffixes**:
   - There are several adverbial case suffixes mentioned, including:
     - **Directive Case Suffix**: Indicates direction towards something (Paragraph 2).
     - **Ablative Case Suffix**: Indicates direction away from something (Paragraph 2).
     - **Instrumental Case Suffix**: Indicates the means by which an action is performed (Paragraph 2).
     - **Reason Case Suffix**: Indicates the reason for an action (Paragraph 2).
     - **Background Case Suffix**: Used for noun phrases that are to be taken as a unit (Paragraph 2).

3. **Vocative Case**:
   - The vocative case is marked by a high tone on the penultimate syllable (Paragraph 2).

4. **Examples and Usage**:
   - The grammar provides examples of these cases in use, showing that they are applied to nouns to indicate various grammatical relationships (Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Iraqw has a productive case system that includes at least the following cases: construct, directive, ablative, instrumental, reason, background, and vocative. This indicates that Iraqw has more than six cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Kinyarwanda. The text does not describe a system of morphological case-marking for grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, it mentions various syntactic constructions and the use of prepositions or verb affixes to indicate relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.

For example, paragraph 15 mentions the use of ""kuku"" to convey locational meanings, and paragraph 28 discusses the instrumental case marked by verb suffixes. However, these instances do not constitute a full-fledged case system but rather specific markers for certain semantic roles.

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion based on the provided information is that Kinyarwanda does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Lango,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lango, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system of nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (ä la Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles."" This indicates that Lango does not use morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates that ""Nouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord class."" This further supports the absence of morphological case-marking in Lango.

2. **Paragraph 2** refers to a ""dative case"" used for indirect objects.
3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the ""accusative case"" and mentions a ""locative/instrumental context.""
4. **Paragraph 4** mentions ""Accusative"" and ""Nominative"" cases.
5. **Paragraph 6** refers to the ""locative/instrumental case.""
6. **Paragraph 7** lists ""Accusative Dependent Pronouns,"" ""Dative Pronouns,"" ""Genitive Independent Pronouns,"" and ""Genitive Dependent Pronouns.""

This gives us a total of 5 distinct cases.

### Reasoning:
The paragraphs provide evidence for the existence of five distinct cases in Murle: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative/instrumental. These cases are mentioned multiple times across different contexts, indicating their productivity in the language.

### Conclusion:
5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Nama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the analysis of the case system in Nama can be summarized as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the subordinative suffix -@, which is used to mark noun phrases of subordinate status. It mentions that if Nama is considered a ""case"" language, it would have two cases: an unmarked case and a marked case with the subordinative -@ suffix. Additionally, there are remnants of an ""agentive case"" marked by -i in certain fixed expressions. However, the analysis suggests that the grammar of Nama noun phrases in terms of a ""case system"" would be unnecessarily complex since there is only one grammatically productive morpheme involved.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Ngiti,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the language exhibits characteristics of exclusively borderline case-marking. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the use of postpositions derived from inalienable nouns, which function as locative markers. This indicates that locative relations are marked through specific postpositions rather than a broader case system.
2. **Paragraph 8**: Mentions the postposition ""ti"" used with both [+human] and [-human] nouns to add an argument to a sentence, indicating a peripheral marking system rather than a full-fledged case system.
3. **Paragraph 17**: Describes the use of postpositions like ""ba"" and ""ti"" in various syntactic constructions, again pointing towards the use of specific markers for locative and other peripheral functions.
4. **Paragraph 22**: Discusses the use of possessive markers and postpositions in possessive constructions, indicating that possession is marked through specific markers rather than a general case system.
5. **Paragraph 46**: Mentions compound postpositions and their modifications, which further supports the idea of specific markers for locative and other peripheral relations.

The evidence suggests that Ngiti uses specific markers for locative and other peripheral relations rather than a productive case paradigm for nouns. Therefore, the language fits the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Oromo (Harar),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oromo (Harar), we can identify several productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant excerpts:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions the ""absolutive case"" and ""locative case"" explicitly.
2. **Paragraph 6** lists several cases: ""absolutive,"" ""dative,"" ""genitive,"" ""instrumental,"" ""locative,"" and ""nominative.""
3. **Paragraph 16** discusses the use of the ""locative case"" with motion verbs.
4. **Paragraph 24** mentions the ""absolutive case"" and ""nominative case.""
5. **Paragraph 48** confirms the ""locative"" as a single invariant form.

From these paragraphs, we can identify at least six distinct cases: absolutive, nominative, dative, genitive, instrumental, and locative. This suggests that Oromo (Harar) has a productive case system with at least six cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Sango,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sango, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The paragraphs primarily discuss the syntactic roles of pronouns, noun phrases, and the use of prepositions like ""na"" and ""ti"" to indicate relationships between words. There is no mention of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves.

Here are some key points from the paragraphs that support this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 45**: ""Except for the category of plural number, which is marked by the prefix â-, no other semantic or grammatical category is represented with the noun itself."" This indicates that nouns do not carry additional morphological markers for cases.

2. **Paragraph 34**: Discusses the use of ""ti"" phrases to indicate possession, equation, attribution, destination, location, time, etc., but does not mention any morphological case-marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions the use of ""na"" to indicate location and time, but again, this is done through prepositions rather than morphological case-marking on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 13**: States that nouns formed with the nominalizing suffix ""-ngô"" can serve as subjects and may be followed by complements appropriate to verbs, but there is no indication of case-marking.

5. **Paragraph 30**: Describes adjunctives (similar to adjectives and adverbs in English) that modify nouns and verbs, but does not mention any case-marking.

Given the absence of any explicit mention of morphological case-marking on nouns and the reliance on prepositions and syntactic constructions to indicate relationships, it is clear that Sango does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Supyire,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the limited use of serial verbs as case markers in Supyire, mentioning that only three verbs are regularly used in this function. This suggests that case marking is not extensive.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Turkana,"### Conclusion: 6-7 cases

### Reasoning:
Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Turkana, the language exhibits a complex system of case marking. Here's a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used for subjects, especially when they follow the verb. It is marked by tonal inflection.
2. **Absolute Case**: Unmarked case used for direct objects, indirect objects, and subjects in certain positions.
3. **Genitive Case**: Used for possessors in associative constructions, marked by tonal inflection.
4. **Instrumental Case**: Used for noun phrases indicating instruments, marked by tonal inflection.
5. **Locative Case (1)**: Used for indicating place or direction, marked by specific gender-sensitive prefixes.
6. **Locative Case (2)**: Used for indicating source, marked by the neuter gender prefix plus a linker.
7. **Vocative Case**: Used in addressing people, marked by a specific tonal pattern.

The descriptions indicate that Turkana has a productive system of case marking with at least six distinct cases: nominative, absolute, genitive, instrumental, locative (1), locative (2), and vocative. This places Turkana in the category of languages with 6-7 cases.",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yoruba,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yoruba, there is no evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of noun usage, including their functions as subjects and objects, their derivation, and their qualifiers, but there is no mention of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, relationships that might be marked by case in other languages seem to be indicated by word order, prepositions, or other syntactic means.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss the use of nouns as subjects and objects without indicating any morphological changes to mark these roles.
   - The presence of prepositions (e.g., ""fi"" for ""with, by means of"") suggests that Yoruba uses prepositions rather than case endings to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
   - There is no mention of any morphological case paradigms or inflections on nouns to indicate different grammatical roles.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Jamsay,"### Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking

**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, Jamsay relies heavily on postpositions to indicate various grammatical relations, such as locative, instrumental, and dative. These postpositions often follow the noun they modify, forming postpositional phrases.

1. **Postpositions for Dative and Spatiotemporal Cases:**
   - Jamsay uses postpositions like ""le$"" for dative and spatiotemporal cases (Paragraph 1).
   - Other postpositions are based on noun stems and can form complex postpositions requiring a complement in the form of a possessor (Paragraph 1).

2. **Examples of Postpositions:**
   - Locative: ""le$"" (in), ""ma@na$"" (on), ""do$ju$"" (under) (Paragraph 16).
   - Instrumental: ""le$"" (with a stick) (Paragraph 4).
   - Dative: ""le$"" (to someone) (Paragraph 4).

3. **Tonal Locatives:**
   - Some nouns can be used as locative adverbs with an extra L-tone component grafted onto the end, forming tonal locatives (Paragraph 16).

4. **Absence of Morphological Case-Marking:**
   - There is no evidence of morphological case-marking on nouns themselves. Instead, the grammatical relations are indicated by the use of postpositions and tonal changes (Paragraphs 1, 4, 16).

5. **Possessive Constructions:**
   - Possessive relationships are indicated by the use of ""ma$"" (Paragraph 14).

6. **Relative Clauses:**
   - Relative clauses in Jamsay do not involve case-marking but rely on tone-dropping and participial suffixes to indicate the head noun's role (Paragraph 33).

Given these observations, Jamsay fits the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete (or peripheral, or semantic) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, rather than a productive morphological case system.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Emai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Emai, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Personal Pronouns and Case Marking**:
   - Emai personal pronouns reflect nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive cases (Paragraph 1). This indicates a system where different grammatical relations (subject, object, indirect object, and possessive) are marked distinctly.

2. **Genitive Case**:
   - The genitive case is used to mark possession and is distinct from other cases (Paragraph 1). This is a clear indication of a productive genitive case.

3. **Applicative Constructions**:
   - Applicative constructions (Paragraph 41) use the postverbal particle li/ni to mark indirect objects (recipients and beneficiaries). This suggests a dative case marking for indirect objects.

4. **Locative Pronouns**:
   - Locative pronouns (Paragraph 17) indicate",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Nyimang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, we can identify the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions ""The Nominative"".
   - Paragraph 8 provides examples of the nominative case, indicating the subject of a verb.

2. **Accusative Case**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions ""Accusative"".
   - Paragraph 8 provides examples of the accusative case, indicating the object of a transitive verb.

3. **Genitive Case**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions ""Genitive"".
   - Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 10 provide examples of the genitive case, indicating possession.

4. **Dative Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions ""Dative"".
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 16 provide examples of the dative case, indicating the indirect object.

5. **Ablative Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions ""Ablative"".
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 16 provide examples of the ablative case, indicating motion away from something.

6. **Locative Case**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions ""Locative"".
   - Paragraph 16 provides examples of the locative case, indicating location or motion towards something.

These cases are explicitly mentioned and exemplified in the provided paragraphs, indicating that Nyimang has a productive case paradigm for these six cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Possessive Constructions**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions possessive constructions using ""POSS"" (e.g., ""Opi POSS spear"").
   - Paragraph 19 discusses the possessive postposition `?a` and its syntactic properties.

2. **Subject and Object Marking**:
   - Paragraph 7 describes the structure of sentences with pronominal subjects and adjoined subjects.
   - Paragraph 8 discusses the thematic roles of subjects and objects in transitive predicates, including detransitivization.

3. **Locative and Instrumental Marking**:
   - Paragraph 19 also touches on the locative postposition `?a` and its usage.

4. **Reduplication and Adverbials**:
   - Paragraph 38 discusses reduplication in adverbials and its syntactic implications.

5. **Noun Phrase Structure**:
   - Paragraph 27 provides examples of noun phrases with possessive constructions and determiners.

From the information provided, it appears that Ma'di uses postpositions for marking possessive and locative relations rather than a rich system of morphological case-marking. The possessive and locative markers are treated as postpositions, which is a common strategy in languages with limited or no morphological case-marking.

Given the evidence, it seems that Ma'di does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns that would qualify as a full-fledged morphological case system. Instead, it relies on postpositions for marking certain relationships, which aligns more with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
- The possessive and locative markers are postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.
- There is no evidence of a productive system of morphological case-marking for a wide range of syntactic functions.
- The language uses pronominal subjects and adjoined subjects, but this does not constitute a morphological case system.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the language exhibits the following cases:

1. **Nominative Case**: Used for subjects, marked with suffixes like -u for unmodified masculine common nouns, -i for modified masculine common nouns and masculine proper nouns ending in -a, and unmarked for feminine nouns.
2. **Accusative Case**: Used for direct objects, marked by a suprafix (high pitch on the final vowel segment).
3. **Dative Case**: Used for indirect objects, marked with suffixes like -ra for modified nouns, -ho for unmodified masculine common nouns, and -te for unmodified feminine common nouns.
4. **Genitive Case**: Used to indicate possession, marked with suffixes like -u, -i, and -te, and also with a suprafix (high pitch on the final vowel segment).
5. **Locative Case**: Used to indicate location, marked with suffixes like -ho for masculine common nouns and -te for feminine common nouns.
6. **Allative Case**: Used to indicate the goal of motion, marked with the suffix -ra.
7. **Ablative-Instrumental Case**: Used to indicate the source or means, marked with the suffix -nni.

The paragraphs indicate that Sidaama has a productive case system with clear morphological markers for at least seven distinct cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, locative, allative, and ablative-instrumental.

**Reasoning**:
- Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 provide evidence of these cases through examples and explanations of their usage and morphological markers.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kunama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can make several observations about the case-marking system in Kunama:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Kunama primarily uses postpositions to express what could be considered case relationships. It explicitly states that ""Inflectional case is lacking in Kunama unless Banti's tone-marked example proves to be correct."" This suggests that Kunama does not have a productive inflectional case system.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reiterates that nominal relationships such as locatives are expressed by postpositions and not by inflectional case markers. It also mentions that postpositions are self-standing words with their own accents, further supporting the idea that Kunama does not have an inflectional case system.

3. **Paragraph 4**: The paragraph mentions the use of the postposition +si for dative (and also accusative), indicating that these roles are marked by postpositions rather than inflectional case endings.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It discusses the use of postpositions and adverbs to express manner and spatial relations, again emphasizing the role of postpositions over inflectional case markers.

5. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph discusses reflexive and reciprocal constructions, which are also handled by verb forms and postpositions rather than by inflectional case markers.

6. **Paragraph 30**: It describes genitive constructions, which are either simple juxtaposition or use a genitive suffix -yna. However, this does not constitute a full inflectional case system as it is limited to possessive constructions.

7. **Paragraph 31**: It mentions the use of postpositions for locative and other relationships, reinforcing the idea that Kunama relies on postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.

8. **Paragraph 47**: This paragraph discusses suprasegmentals and stress but does not provide evidence of an inflectional case system.

From these observations, it is clear that Kunama does not have a productive inflectional case system. Instead, it uses postpositions to mark grammatical relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages. The mention of a possible tone-marked nominative and accusative distinction is not sufficient to classify Kunama as having a productive case system.

### Conclusion:
**No morphological case-marking**",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that subject and object noun phrases (NPs) are unmarked for case, but it also states that case relators follow the noun as enclitics. This suggests the presence of some form of case marking, albeit not for subjects and objects.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses genitive case marking on clausal participants, indicating that the genitive is used in dependent clauses. This confirms the presence of at least one case.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph outlines various orientation roles (adessive, allative, elative, etc.) and mentions that these roles are encoded by case markers. This suggests multiple cases related to spatial and temporal orientation.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph does not provide direct information about case marking but discusses the marking of definite and animate direct objects, implying some form of differential object marking.

5. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions that Alamblak encodes the recipient role using the same form as the direct object in transitive clauses, indicating a form of case marking for recipients.

6. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph describes the structure of the clause and mentions inner and outer objects, which are distinct from traditional direct and indirect objects. This suggests a nuanced system of marking different types of objects.

7. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the referent case marker, which encodes multiple roles such as adessive, allative, elative, efficient cause, and point-of-reference. This indicates a multifunctional case marker.

8. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph provides an overview of peripheral noun phrases and mentions that several case enclitics encode more than one meaning, reinforcing the presence of multiple cases.

9. **Paragraph 21**: This paragraph discusses genitivisation in embedded clauses and mentions that subjects of intransitives and objects of transitives can be marked with the genitive, following an ergative pattern.

10. **Paragraph 26**: This paragraph mentions three generalised roles for nuclear NPs (Actor, Undergoer, and Object) and discusses the roles encoded by peripheral NPs, indicating a complex system of case marking.

11. **Paragraph 28**: This paragraph discusses role structure in dependent clauses and mentions genitive case marking on nuclear participants, further supporting the presence of multiple cases.

12. **Paragraph 31**: This paragraph discusses the encoding of participant roles by verb agreement markers and mentions actor, undergoer, and object functions, indicating a system of case marking related to these roles.

13. **Paragraph 33**: This paragraph discusses causative and benefactive constructions, which add participants and thus increase transitivity, implying a system of marking these additional roles.

14. **Paragraph 35**: This paragraph discusses the occurrence of inalienable possessions in case-marked NPs, indicating the presence of case marking for these constructions.

15. **Paragraph 37**: This paragraph mentions that time words are restricted to specific or general setting case suffixes, indicating the presence of temporal case marking.

16. **Paragraph 39**: This paragraph discusses the general setting case and its interpretation as surface location and temporal reference roles, indicating the presence of these specific cases.

17. **Paragraph 41**: This paragraph discusses the allative case and modal roles, indicating the presence of these specific cases.

18. **Paragraph 43**: This paragraph discusses the syntactic features of nuclear NPs and mentions that the subject NP is unmarked for case, but other NPs are marked, indicating a system of differential case marking.

19. **Paragraph 45**: This paragraph discusses the inclusion of inalienable possessions in case frames, indicating the presence of case marking for these constructions.

20. **Paragraph 47**: This paragraph discusses pronouns and their inflection for person, number, and gender, indicating a system of marking these features.

21. **Paragraph 49**: This paragraph discusses the phonological aspects of case marking, indicating the presence of nasal segments in certain environments.

22. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph discusses case frames of simple verbs and mentions various roles such as actor, undergoer, and location, indicating a complex system of case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Alamblak exhibits a complex system of case marking that includes multiple cases for various roles such as genitive, adessive, allative, elative, and others. The presence of these cases suggests that Alamblak has 10 or more cases.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amele, the language exhibits characteristics that align with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" Here is the reasoning:

1. **Possession and Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 6 discuss possession, indicating that inalienably possessed nouns are marked for person and number of the possessor, but this marking is more about possession than syntactic case roles.
   - Paragraph 20 and Paragraph 48 detail the use of postpositions to indicate relationships such as time, location, and possession, rather than a productive case system.

2. **Syntactic Functions**:
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 44 describe the syntactic functions of nouns and pronouns, emphasizing that personal pronouns can function as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, or adverbials without indicating a productive case system.
   - Paragraph 11 mentions verbal object marking through clitics, which distinguishes direct from indirect objects, but this is not indicative of a full-fledged case system.

3. **Lack of Morphological Case Marking**:
   - Throughout the paragraphs, there is no mention of a systematic morphological case-marking paradigm for nouns that would indicate nominative, accusative, dative, or other syntactic roles typical of a productive case system.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The language uses postpositions and possessive constructions to express relationships that might be handled by cases in other languages, but these are not integrated into a broader morphological case system.

Given these observations, Amele does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns but uses postpositions and possessive markers to indicate certain relationships, fitting the description of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions ""case frames"" for verbs, indicating a system of marking roles such as Agent (AG), Patient (PAT), Affected person (AFF), and Locative (LOC). This suggests a system of case marking, but it does not specify the number of cases directly.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the semantic classification of verbs and their case frames, further indicating the presence of a case system. However, it does not provide specific details on the number of cases.

3. **Paragraph 10**: Describes the structural classification of verbs and mentions subject and object markers, which implies a nominative-accusative alignment but does not detail the number of cases.

4. **Paragraph 15**: Talks about noun suffixes that encode number and class, which could be related to case marking but does not explicitly state the number of cases.

5. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions object suffixes for person and number, which suggests the presence of at least an accusative case. However, it does not provide a complete picture of the case system.

6. **Paragraph 24**: Describes motion verbs and their associated phrases, which could involve locative or directional cases, but again, it does not specify the number of cases.

7. **Paragraph 40**: Lists various case frames for verb stems, including Agent, Patient, Affected person, Locative, Instrumental, and Temporal. This suggests a rich case system but does not quantify the number of cases.

8. **Paragraph 41**: Discusses instrumental-benefactive phrases, indicating the presence of instrumental and benefactive cases.

9. **Paragraph 42**: Describes the structure of intransitive clauses, mentioning temporal and locative tagmemes, which could correspond to temporal and locative cases.

10. **Paragraph 47**: Mentions possessive modifiers and suffixes, indicating the presence of a genitive case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Arapesh (Mountain) has a productive case paradigm that includes at least nominative, accusative, genitive, locative, instrumental, and benefactive cases. This suggests a system with multiple cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Asmat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, the language exhibits a variety of morphological markers that indicate different grammatical relations. However, these markers do not form a comprehensive case system that covers core syntactic functions like nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the markers seem to be more focused on specific semantic roles or peripheral relations.

1. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 2** discuss possessive pronouns and their variants, but do not indicate a broader case system.
2. **Paragraph 3** mentions plural markers for kinship terms but does not discuss case marking.
3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss accentuation and phonological features, which are not relevant to case marking.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss pronouns and their morphological valence, but again, do not indicate a comprehensive case system.
5. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 9** discuss directional pronouns and interrogatives, which are more about spatial relations and questioning rather than case marking.
6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss negations and postpositions, which are not indicative of a case system.
7. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** discuss verbal morphology and categories, which are not directly related to noun case marking.
8. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss phonological alternations and core categories of verbs, which are not relevant to noun case marking.
9. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss morphological structures and categories of verbs, which do not indicate a case system for nouns.
10. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss syntactical valence and elements of unclear function, which do not provide evidence of a case system.
11. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 21** discuss negations and postpositions, which are not indicative of a case system.
12. **Paragraph 22** and **Paragraph 23** discuss accentuation and phonological features, which are not relevant to case marking.
13. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** discuss verbal categories and paradigms, which are not related to noun case marking.
14. **Paragraph 26** and **Paragraph 27** discuss negations and personal possessive pronouns, which do not indicate a comprehensive case system.
15. **Paragraph 28** and **Paragraph 29** discuss phonological features and dialects, which are not relevant to case marking.
16. **Paragraph 30** and **Paragraph 31** discuss morphological processes and verb structures, which are not indicative of a noun case system.
17. **Paragraph 32** and **Paragraph 33** discuss demonstrative pronouns and their usage, which do not indicate a comprehensive case system.
18. **Paragraph 34** and **Paragraph 35** discuss verbal word-groups and formal characteristics of verbs, which are not related to noun case marking.
19. **Paragraph 36** and **Paragraph 37** discuss paradigms and formal characteristics of verbs, which are not indicative of a noun case system.
20. **Paragraph 38** and **Paragraph 39** discuss elements of unclear function and syntactical valence, which do not provide evidence of a case system.
21. **Paragraph 40** and **Paragraph 41** discuss exceptions to morphological rules and positional roots, which are not indicative of a noun case system.
22. **Paragraph 42** and **Paragraph 43** discuss reduplication and free variation, which are not relevant to case marking.
23. **Paragraph 44** and **Paragraph 45** discuss morphological valence and derivatives, which do not indicate a comprehensive case system.
24. **Paragraph 46** and **Paragraph 47** discuss formal characteristics and semantic elements of completion, which are not related to noun case marking.
25. **Paragraph 48** and **Paragraph 49** discuss optative categories and adjective usage, which are not indicative of a noun case system.
26. **Paragraph 50** discusses the absence of a suffix in certain forms, which is not relevant to case marking.

Given the information, it appears that Asmat does not have a comprehensive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses specific markers for possessive relations and other peripheral functions.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karo Batak, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses noun incorporation and the inability of objects to be modified by adjectives, noun-classifiers, or demonstratives, indicating a lack of morphological case-marking for objects.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions personal pronouns and their roles in clauses but does not indicate any case-marking for nouns.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Describes prepositional phrases used to indicate location and possession, suggesting that relational meanings are expressed through prepositions rather than case-marking.
4. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the passive construction and the use of prefixes for verbs, but there is no mention of case-marking for nouns.
5. **Paragraph 7**: States that active clauses are monotransitive and do not have dual objects, implying a lack of case-marking for distinguishing different types of objects.
6. **Paragraph 14**: Mentions possessive constructions and the use of word order to express possession, with some vestiges of a genitive marker in archaic expressions, but no productive case-marking system is described.
7. **Paragraph 15**: Indicates that Karo does not have case-marking on pronouns or tense-marking on verbs, further supporting the absence of a case system for nouns.
8. **Paragraph 22**: Describes the use of prefixes for marking actor and undergoer roles in verbs, but not for nouns.
9. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses the use of possessive pronouns and enclitics, but again, there is no mention of case-marking for nouns.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Karo Batak relies on word order, prepositions, and verb prefixes to indicate grammatical relations rather than a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The evidence suggests that Chamorro primarily uses prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships rather than morphological case markers. 

- **Paragraph 2** mentions that early grammarians tried to fit Chamorro into a Latin framework with nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative cases, but the word ""taotao"" remained unchanged, indicating no morphological case marking.
- **Paragraph 8** discusses noun phrases and mentions various types of noun phrases without indicating any morphological case marking.
- **Paragraph 29** on possession shows that possessive relationships are marked by possessive pronouns rather than case inflections.
- **Paragraph 47** on classifiers and possessive pronouns further supports the lack of morphological case marking, as relationships are indicated through possessive pronouns and classifiers rather than case endings.
- **Paragraph 46** on prepositions like ""gi"" and ""giya"" shows that spatial and other relationships are expressed through prepositions, not case endings.

Given this evidence, Chamorro does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relationships on nouns.

2. **Conclusion:**
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Daga,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Daga exhibits the following characteristics relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Locative Suffixes**: Paragraph 1 mentions various locative forms such as ""oea"" (overhead), ""ita"" (lower level near), ""ao"" (up; high), ""isi"" (lower level), ""uta"" (higher level near), ""utu"" (higher level far), ""ise"" (higher level beyond), ""ae"" (lower level beyond), ""ea"" (underneath), and ""ata"" (same level). These forms indicate a rich system of locative marking.

2. **Possessive Suffixes**: Paragraph 23 and Paragraph 36 describe possessive suffixes like ""-ga"" for possessive pronouns and intimate possessive suffixes such as ""-na"" (my), ""-ga"" (your), ""-e"" (his), ""-nu"" (our), ""-ya"" (your plural), and ""-mu"" (their). This suggests a productive system for marking possession.

3. **Substantive Clitic**: Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 10 discuss the substantive clitic ""-wa"" which marks a substantive relationship between nouns and can occur on adjectives and verbs, indicating a nominal construction.

4. **Nominalized Verbs**: Paragraph 25 and Paragraph 44 mention nominalized verbs used in various grammatical constructions, further indicating the presence of nominal morphology.

5. **Case-like Functions**: Paragraph 39 describes the Possessive Phrase, which includes possessive pronouns and suffixes, and Paragraph 35 mentions postpositions like ""den"" (with) and ""tana"" (with), which function similarly to case markers in indicating relationships between nouns.

6. **Emphatic and Superlative Intensifiers**: Paragraph 43 and Paragraph 45 discuss intensifiers and their suffixes, which, while not cases, show additional morphological complexity.

From these observations, it is clear that Daga has a system of morphological marking for locative, possessive, and possibly other relationships. However, the primary productive case-like markers seem to be for locative and possessive functions, with other relationships being marked by postpositions or clitics rather than a full-fledged case system.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Daga in terms of case marking is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**

This classification reflects the presence of overt marking for locative and possessive relationships, which are concrete or peripheral case relations, without a broader system of syntactic case marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the information about case marking in Dani (Lower Grand Valley) is somewhat scattered and indirect. However, there are a few key points that can be extracted to determine the nature of case marking in this language.

1. **Paragraph 13** mentions a five-way contrast in semantic relationships of personal objects, suggesting a nuanced system of marking different roles.
2. **Paragraph 37** discusses the agent and patient roles, indicating that these roles are marked in some way, which is consistent with a case-marking system.
3. **Paragraph 48** suggests an ergative case structure, where the subject of transitive verbs is marked differently from the object of transitive verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs.

From these points, it can be inferred that Dani has a system of case marking that distinguishes at least the following roles:
- Agent (subject of transitive verbs)
- Patient (object of transitive verbs)
- Possibly other roles such as beneficiary or locative, as suggested by the five-way contrast mentioned in Paragraph 13.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Dani (Lower Grand Valley) has a productive case system with at least three distinct cases: nominative (or ergative), accusative (or absolutive), and possibly additional cases for other roles.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of a five-way contrast in semantic roles (Paragraph 13) suggests multiple cases.
- The mention of an ergative structure (Paragraph 48) indicates at least two core cases (ergative and absolutive).
- The discussion of agent and patient roles (Paragraph 37) further supports the presence of distinct case markings for different grammatical functions.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",6-7 cases,3 cases
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hamtai, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that the primary verb in Sentence Type 2C is a transitive one and takes objective pronoun prefixes, which suggests the presence of direct and/or indirect objects.
2. **Paragraph 2** indicates that nouns or objective pronouns in direct and indirect object positions may follow or precede each other.
3. **Paragraph 11** states that nouns in object position have the same form as nouns in subject position, implying no morphological distinction between these cases.
4. **Paragraph 18** refers to object pronouns and indirect object (personal) nouns.
5. **Paragraph 29** mentions that a noun may show possession by the addition of a suffix.
6. **Paragraph 48** explicitly states that the noun is not declined and functions as the object of the verb, except with nouns related to natural forces, where the noun is the subject of the verb.

From these observations, it is clear that Hamtai does not employ a productive case-marking system for distinguishing between subject and object positions morphologically. The same form is used for nouns regardless of their syntactic function (subject or object), and possession is indicated by a suffix rather than a case system.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar does not describe any morphological changes to nouns based on their syntactic roles (subject, object, etc.).
- The mention of possession being indicated by a suffix does not imply a broader case system but rather a specific possessive construction.
- The explicit statement that nouns are not declined supports the conclusion that there is no morphological case-marking system in Hamtai.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Hua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hua, the language exhibits a rich system of case marking. Here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the nominative case and its functions.
2. **Paragraph 2** lists genitive, locative, and comitative cases.
3. **Paragraph 3** discusses the ergative case.
4. **Paragraph 4** reiterates the genitive, locative/allative, inessive/illative, and comitative cases.
5. **Paragraph 6** lists the nominative, ergative, genitive, comitative, locative, inessive, ablative, elative, and benefactive cases.
6. **Paragraph 7** mentions the nominative, ergative, adessive/allative, inessive/illative, ablative, elative, and benefactive cases.
7. **Paragraph 15** discusses the genitive case.
8. **Paragraph 16** mentions the nominative, ergative, benefactive, adessive/allative, and inessive/illative cases.
9. **Paragraph 30** lists the nominative, ergative, adessive, inessive, ablative, elative, and benefactive cases.

From these paragraphs, we can identify at least the following cases in Hua:
- Nominative
- Ergative
- Genitive
- Comitative
- Locative/Allative
- Inessive/Illative
- Ablative
- Elative
- Benefactive

This gives us a total of at least 9 distinct cases. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Hua based on the provided information is:

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Ilocano,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking of nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions core case marking for noun phrases, specifically ergative and absolutive cases, and an oblique case for peripheral nouns.
2. **Paragraph 3** discusses the absolutive case for single core arguments in intransitive verbs.
3. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** further elaborate on the ergative and absolutive cases, with examples of verbs taking arguments in these cases.
4. **Paragraph 7** describes the use of enclitic pronouns to express both the actor (ergative) and patient (absolutive) roles.
5. **Paragraph 9** mentions the oblique case for indefinite notional patients or objects in intransitive verbs.
6. **Paragraph 15** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the focus system and the assignment of absolutive case to the privileged syntactic status of nouns.
7. **Paragraph 19** and **Paragraph 20** outline the ergative and absolutive pronouns, reinforcing the presence of these cases.
8. **Paragraph 23** introduces the comitative focus, which places the party with whom the action is performed in the absolutive case.
9. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** describe the core and oblique distinction in noun phrases, with core nouns taking case marking and oblique nouns not being verbal arguments.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Ilocano has a system of case marking that includes at least the ergative, absolutive, and oblique cases. Additionally, the comitative focus introduces another case-like marking, but it is primarily a focus system rather than a separate case.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of ergative and absolutive cases is well-documented in the paragraphs.
- The oblique case is also mentioned for peripheral nouns and indefinite notional patients or objects.
- The comitative focus, while not a separate case, adds to the complexity of the case-marking system.

Given this information, Ilocano has a productive case paradigm that includes at least three distinct cases: ergative, absolutive, and oblique.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

1. **Case Marking Overview**:
   - Imonda has a system of case marking that includes several distinct markers for different grammatical relations.
   - The primary case markers identified are:
     - **-m**: Primarily a goal marker but also marks recipients, beneficiaries, and certain objects.
     - **-ia**: Locative marker.
     - **-nei**: Source marker.
     - **-na**: Instrumental marker.

2. **Productive Case Paradigms**:
   - The language uses these markers productively across various noun phrases to indicate their grammatical roles.
   - The markers are used consistently and are not limited to peripheral or concrete relations alone.

3. **Evidence from Paragraphs**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: Mentions that nominals can take case marking.
   - **Paragraph 3**: Describes how personal pronouns behave like nouns with possessive and locative markers.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the optional marking of objects and obligatory marking of recipients and beneficiaries.
   - **Paragraph 10**: Details the case-marking system, including locative, goal, and source markers.
   - **Paragraph 21**: Summarizes the typical Papuan case system, including locative, cause, goal, source, and instrumental markers.
   - **Paragraph 35**: Discusses the syntactic significance of the case marker -m.
   - **Paragraph 49**: Describes the use of -m as a goal marker and its application in various contexts.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The language has a productive case system with distinct markers for different grammatical relations.
   - The number of distinct cases identified (locative, goal, source, instrumental, and possibly others) suggests a system with at least 5 cases.

### Conclusion:
**5 cases**",5 cases,5 cases
Atayal,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, the language exhibits a productive case system with three distinct cases: nominative, genitive, and dative.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Nominative Case:** The nominative case is used for subjects, predicates, and topics of sentences (Paragraphs 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 16, 23).
   - **Genitive Case:** The genitive case is used to indicate possession and is also used for agents in passive constructions (Paragraphs 5, 11, 18, 24, 36, 48).
   - **Dative Case:** The dative case is used for the objects of prepositions and phrases meaning ""belong to"" and for indicating location (Paragraphs 6, 13, 35).

These cases are consistently marked and used in various syntactic roles, indicating a productive case-marking system.

2. **Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the case system in Kewa. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions that case markers in Kewa are described according to their function at various grammatical levels, including genitive, locative, time, instrument, accompaniment, referent-reason, and topic.

2. **Paragraph 21** provides examples of case markers:
   - **-para** for locative
   - **-me** for instrument
   - **-nane** for directional

3. **Paragraph 23** mentions the accusative case marker **-daa**.

4. **Paragraph 31** suggests that clitics such as **-me** and **-para** function as surface case markers for certain tagmemes.

From these points, we can identify at least four distinct cases: genitive, locative, instrumental, and accusative. Additionally, the mention of directional and other semantic functions suggests that there might be more cases.

Given the information, it is reasonable to conclude that Kewa has a productive case system with at least 6-7 cases, considering the explicit mention of multiple case markers and their functions.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Kobon,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kobon, we can extract the following relevant information regarding case marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the use of pronominal forms and possessive adjectives but does not provide explicit information about case marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions that reflexive pronouns are not marked for case, and reciprocal pronouns are used in specific constructions. This indicates that there is no special case marking for reflexivity.

3. **Paragraph 14**: Describes postpositional particles like ""aip"" (accompanier), ""abe"" (coordinated nominal), ""hald"" (circumstance or concessive), and ""néb6"" (place or territorial origin). These particles function similarly to cases in marking relationships but are not inflectional case markers on nouns themselves.

4. **Paragraph 24**: Reiterates the use of postpositional particles for marking relationships such as accompanier, coordinated nominal, and locative functions.

5. **Paragraph 28**: Discusses the morphological marking of kinship nouns to indicate possession by second or third persons, but this is not the same as a productive case system.

6. **Paragraph 34**: Mentions that the complement noun phrase often contains an embedded adjectivalized clause, but does not indicate a system of morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 36**: Discusses the movement of heavy structures within sentences but does not provide information on case marking.

8. **Paragraph 43**: Talks about demonstrative pronouns and their anaphoric functions but does not mention case marking.

9. **Paragraph 44**: Discusses the topic-comment structure and the role of experiencers, but again, no mention of morphological case marking.

10. **Paragraph 47**: Mentions the juxtaposition of clauses for comparison but does not provide information on case marking.

11. **Paragraph 50**: Discusses the use of the particle ""ke"" for emphasis and reflexivity, but this is not indicative of a case system.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is evident that Kobon uses postpositional particles to mark relationships that are typically handled by cases in other languages. However, there is no evidence of a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. The language relies on postpositions rather than inflectional case endings.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Kombai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological features and functions of nouns and noun phrases. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It explicitly states that apart from possessive pronominal prefixes, there is no noun-related morphology in Kombai. This strongly suggests the absence of a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the use of relational nouns and verbs but does not mention any case marking on nouns. Instead, it highlights the use of relational nouns to express semantic relations.

3. **Paragraph 12**: Mentions relational nouns and grammaticalisation but does not indicate any case marking on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 14**: Describes the preferred expression for terms in Kombai, which involves a modifier plus head noun structure, but does not mention any case marking.

5. **Paragraph 25**: Discusses the use of relational head nouns in question-words, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses, but again, there is no mention of case marking.

6. **Paragraph 47**: Indicates that ""ro"" is in the process of losing its noun status and becoming a subordinator, which further suggests that Kombai relies on relational nouns and other strategies rather than case marking.

7. **Paragraph 2**: Reiterates that there is no noun-related morphology apart from possessive pronominal prefixes, reinforcing the absence of a case system.

From these points, it is clear that Kombai does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it uses relational nouns and other strategies to express these relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about case marking and the types of cases mentioned.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Lavukaleve has ""case marking for three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load."" This indicates that there are three specific cases used for spatial or relational purposes.

2. **Paragraph 2** does not provide additional information about case marking.

3. **Paragraph 3** does not provide additional information about case marking.

4. **Paragraph 4** does not provide additional information about case marking.

5. **Paragraph 5** does not provide additional information about case marking.

6. **Paragraph 6** does not provide additional information about case marking.

7. **Paragraph 7** does not provide additional information about case marking.

8. **Paragraph 8** does not provide additional information about case marking.

9. **Paragraph 9** does not provide additional information about case marking.

10. **Paragraph 10** does not provide additional information about case marking.

From the information in Paragraph 1, we know that Lavukaleve has three spatial/relational cases. These cases are used for specific spatial or relational functions, which aligns with the definition of concrete or peripheral cases.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Madurese, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Absence of Morphological Case-Marking**:
   - The provided text does not mention any specific morphological case markers for nouns. Instead, it discusses various verbal affixes and their roles in marking voice, aspect, and other verbal categories.
   - The examples provided show that syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are indicated through word order and prepositions rather than through case inflections on nouns.

2. **Prepositional Phrases**:
   - The text frequently mentions the use of prepositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence (e.g., ""dha'/ka ‘to’"", ""neng ‘at’"", ""bi' ‘with’"").
   - This reliance on prepositions rather than case inflections suggests that Madurese uses syntactic means rather than morphological means to indicate grammatical relationships.

3. **Voice and Applicative Constructions**:
   - The language employs a rich system of verbal morphology to indicate voice (actor voice, object voice) and applicative constructions (e.g., benefactive, locative, instrumental).
   - These verbal affixes adjust the valence and syntactic roles of arguments but do not constitute a case-marking system on nouns themselves.

4. **Possession and Definiteness**:
   - Possession is marked by the definite suffix -na, which is attached to the possessed noun, followed by the possessor noun. This is a specific morphological marker but does not extend to a broader case-marking system.

5. **Reduplication and Derivational Morphology**:
   - Reduplication and derivational affixes are used to form plurals, adjectives, and other derived forms, but these processes do not function as case markers.

6. **Examples and Illustrations**:
   - The examples provided in the text show nouns in various syntactic roles without any case inflections. For instance, ""Sengko' lo' maca buku-na ba'eng"" (I haven’t read your book) shows the noun ""buku-na"" (book-DEF) without any case marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mokilese, there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text does not describe any morphological case-marking system that would indicate the presence of cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, the language seems to rely on other grammatical mechanisms, such as possessive suffixes and relational nouns, to indicate relationships between nouns.

Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: The text describes possessive suffixes that change depending on the possessor (e.g., first person, second person, third person) and the number (e.g., singular, dual, plural, remote plural). This indicates a system of possessive marking rather than a general case system.

2. **Relational Nouns**: The text mentions relational nouns and locative particles (e.g., ""nehn"" for 'inside of') to indicate spatial and other relationships, which are not cases but rather specific relational terms.

3. **Lack of Case Descriptions**: There is no mention of nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, or any other traditional grammatical cases in the provided text. The grammar focuses on other aspects such as pronouns, possessive suffixes, and noun phrases.

4. **Construct Forms**: The construct forms (e.g., ""oadoan"" for 'name of') are used to show possession or relationships between nouns, but these are not cases in the traditional sense. They are more akin to possessive constructions.

5. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: The text does not describe any morphological changes to nouns that would indicate different grammatical roles (such as subject, object, etc.) within a sentence.

Given these points, it is clear that Mokilese does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Palauan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Palauan, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text primarily discusses pronouns, verb forms, and other grammatical features without indicating a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** discuss pronouns and their forms but do not mention any case-marking for nouns.
   - **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 25** describe sentence structures and noun positions (subject and object) but do not indicate any morphological changes to nouns based on their grammatical function.
   - **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 18** discuss possessor suffixes and possessed nouns, which are related to possession rather than case-marking.
   - **Paragraph 27** and **Paragraph 44** focus on the sound system and noun phrases but do not provide evidence of a case system.

Given the absence of information on morphological case-marking for nouns in the provided text, it is reasonable to conclude that Palauan does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Sentani language, we can determine the number of cases in Sentani by examining the relevant information about noun morphology and case-marking.

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions possessive phrases and the use of postpositions like ""le ~ de"" to indicate possession, but it does not explicitly mention case-marking.
2. **Paragraph 15** discusses postpositional constructions extensively, indicating that relational markers follow nouns, pronouns, or verbal forms. Examples include ""ifa na"" (in the canoe), ""bu na"" (in the water), ""jo da"" (to the village), and ""ime da"" (from the house). This suggests that Sentani uses postpositions rather than inflectional case-marking to indicate grammatical relations.
3. **Paragraph 35** describes predicative constructions, including verbal, nominal, emphatic, negative, and postpositional types. The examples provided do not show inflectional case-marking but instead rely on word order and postpositions.
4. **Paragraph 50** further supports the use of postpositions for clause subordination and conditional clauses, reinforcing the idea that Sentani uses postpositions rather than inflectional case-marking.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Sentani does not use inflectional case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to indicate grammatical relations such as location, direction, and possession.

**Reasoning:**
The information provided in the paragraphs consistently points to the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case-marking. There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Sentani. The language uses postpositions to mark relational and locative functions, which aligns with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Suena. The text does not provide clear evidence of a system where nouns are marked for grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, the text seems to focus on verb forms, tense, aspect, and other grammatical features without detailing a case system.

Given the absence of explicit information about noun case marking, the most appropriate conclusion is that Suena likely does not employ a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Reasoning:**
1. The paragraphs provided do not describe any morphological markers on nouns that would indicate different grammatical cases.
2. The focus of the grammar seems to be on verb forms and other grammatical constructions rather than on noun case marking.
3. No examples of noun inflections for case were provided, which suggests that such a system may not be present.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Taba,"Based on the provided paragraphs, Taba does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on adpositions and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2 (4.3.1 Adpositions)**: This paragraph explicitly states that Taba uses adpositions to mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases. It mentions that Taba has both prepositions and a postposition, with the postposition marking nouns as locative and prepositions marking a variety of other roles. This indicates that Taba uses adpositions rather than morphological case markers to indicate grammatical relationships.

2. **Paragraph 10 (The heads of noun phrases)**: This paragraph discusses the structure of noun phrases in Taba, mentioning that number is usually only marked on nouns having human referents. There is no mention of morphological case marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 16 (Reflexive constructions)**: This paragraph discusses reflexive constructions in Taba, where a pronominal copy of the reflexive object must occur. This indicates a reliance on pronouns and syntactic structures rather than morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 13 (Nouns & noun phrases)**: This paragraph provides examples of nouns occurring in various syntactic roles, such as the Actor argument of an intransitive verb, the Undergoer argument of a transitive verb, and as the object of a postposition. The examples show that Taba uses word order and adpositions to indicate grammatical relationships rather than morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 17 (Actors, primary Undergoers, and secondary Undergoers)**: This paragraph discusses the syntactic roles of arguments in Taba, indicating that grammatical relations are described in terms of word order and cross-referencing on verbs rather than morphological case marking.

6. **Paragraph 30 (Bivalent intransitive derivation)**: This paragraph discusses the use of applicative morphology to mark additional arguments, indicating that Taba uses derivational morphology rather than inflectional case marking.

7. **Paragraph 37 (Prepositions)**: This paragraph lists the prepositions in Taba and their functions, further supporting the use of adpositions rather than morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 48 (Particles)**: This paragraph discusses various particles in Taba, including adpositions and conjunctions, which are used to indicate grammatical relationships.

Given the reliance on adpositions and syntactic structures rather than morphological case marking, the appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Tagalog by examining the morphological marking of nouns and pronouns.

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Tagalog has three types of marked nominals: personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns. Each of these pronouns occurs in one of three different forms according to its function in the sentence. This indicates the presence of three distinct forms for marking different grammatical functions.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides a detailed chart of personal pronouns, showing three forms for each pronoun: ang form, ng form, and sa form. These forms correspond to different grammatical functions, reinforcing the idea that there are three distinct case markers.

3. **Paragraph 3**: It reiterates that personal pronouns have three forms: ang, ng, and sa, which correspond to different grammatical functions.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It states that all nominals other than personal and deictic pronouns and personal nouns are unmarked nouns. The function of these unmarked nouns is not always explicitly indicated by a preceding marker, but they can occur in constructions with markers.

5. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph explicitly states that every marked noun occurs in three different forms or with three different markers, each indicating a particular set of sentence functions. The three forms are called the ang form, the ng form, and the sa form.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Tagalog has a productive case paradigm for nouns and pronouns, with three distinct forms corresponding to different grammatical functions.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Tukang Besi by examining the morphological case-marking system described. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph explicitly mentions four articles used to mark case relations: the nominative ""na,"" the non-nominative core ""te,"" the genitive ""nu,"" and the oblique ""i/di."" This indicates that Tukang Besi has at least four distinct morphological cases.

2. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph discusses the nominative article ""na"" and the non-nominative core article ""te,"" further confirming the presence of these cases.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses the genitive article ""nu"" and its distribution, reinforcing the presence of a genitive case.

4. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the oblique case marker ""i"" and its usage, confirming the presence of an oblique case.

5. **Paragraph 39**: This paragraph provides a table summarizing the use of articles and prepositions, indicating that the articles ""na,"" ""te,"" ""i,"" and ""nu"" are used to mark various semantic roles, further supporting the presence of these four cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence from the descriptive grammar, Tukang Besi has a productive case paradigm with four distinct morphological cases: nominative, non-nominative core, genitive, and oblique.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",no morphological case-marking,4 cases

Yimas,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, Yimas has a single productive case marker, the oblique suffix -n or -nan, which is used to mark peripheral roles such as instruments, locatives, and temporals. This is the only case marker mentioned, and it is used consistently across various examples to indicate these roles. There is no mention of other case markers for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive, which suggests that Yimas relies on other grammatical mechanisms, such as pronominal affixes on verbs, to indicate these relations.

2. **Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the nominative (te) and accusative (ke) case markers, which are used optionally to mark subjects and objects, respectively. This indicates the presence of at least two cases.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph reiterates the use of te (nominative) and ke (accusative) as case markers in verbal clauses, further confirming the presence of these two cases.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph mentions the nominative marker te and the accusative marker ke again, reinforcing the presence of these two cases.

4. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph provides a table of postpositional case markers, listing te (nominative), ke (accusative), ni (dative), fini/namu (instrumental), and kumu (comitative). This expands the number of cases to at least five.

5. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the use of te and ke as case markers and mentions their optional nature, which aligns with the previous paragraphs.

6. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph describes the use of the accusative marker ke in experiential constructions, further supporting the presence of the accusative case.

7. **Paragraph 26**: This paragraph discusses postpositional case markers, including te (nominative), ke(mu) (accusative), ni (dative), fini/namu (instrumental), and kumu (comitative), confirming the presence of these five cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, Aghu has at least five productive case paradigms of nouns: nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, and comitative.

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides a table (Table 3.5) that lists various cases in Manambu, including the accusative-locative, dative-aversive, allative-instrumental, terminative, transportative, substitutive, and comitative cases. This indicates that Manambu has at least these eight distinct cases.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph explicitly states that Manambu has a system of nine case forms. It also mentions that by their functions and meanings, one can distinguish eighteen cases, but the focus here is on the nine case forms.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the functions of nouns unmarked for case and provides examples of various cases, reinforcing the presence of multiple cases in the language.

4. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph summarizes the number of cases in",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Duna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, the language exhibits a productive case-marking system. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Contrasted Subject (CS) Marking**:
   - Paragraph 2 discusses the use of contrasted subject marking, which resembles ergative case marking. This marking is applied to distinguish the subject NP from other clausal participants, especially in multivalent predicates. The CS marker -ka is used for this purpose.
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 provide examples of CS marking in sentences, indicating its productive use in the language.

2. **Locative and Beneficiary/Possessor Marking**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the locative marker -ta and the beneficiary/possessor postposition -ya, which are used to mark locative and possessive relationships within NPs.
   - Paragraph 18 further exemplifies the use of -ya in possessive constructions.

3. **Instrumental and Other Role-Marking Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 16 and Paragraph 28 discuss the use of the instrumental marker -ka and other role-marking postpositions, such as -aka for accompanier and -ya for beneficiary/possessor.

4. **Dependent Third Person Pronouns**:
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 25 discuss the use of dependent third person pronouns, which can be encliticised to NPs and are typically used to denote subject arguments and possessors.

5. **Specificity and Grouphood Markers**:
   - Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 9 mention the use of specificity markers like -na and group markers like -tia, which are used to mark specific individuals or groups within NPs.

6. **Summary of Case Marking**:
   - The various markers discussed (CS marker -ka, locative marker -ta, beneficiary/possessor marker -ya, instrumental marker -ka, and specificity marker -na) indicate that Duna has a productive system of case marking for different grammatical relations and semantic roles.

Given the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Duna has a productive case-marking system with at least six distinct cases: nominative (CS marker), locative, beneficiary/possessor, instrumental, specificity, and group markers.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about noun morphology and syntactic structures.

1. **Paragraph 3** (Typological profile):
   - ""There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it indicates an associative plural.""
   - ""There is no morphological case- or adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the verb by cross-referencing affixes.""

2. **Paragraph 5** (Grammatical relations):
   - ""Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked.""

3. **Paragraph 17** (Properties common to all nouns):
   - ""Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather, verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause.""

4. **Paragraph 24** (Articles as noun phrase determiners):
   - ""Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the article to agree in gender with its noun.""

5. **Paragraph 30** (Medial versus final verbs):
   - ""Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject (A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or adpositional marking for these.""

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Mian does not use morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and recipient are indicated through verbal affixes and other syntactic means rather than through case inflections on the nouns themselves.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Inanwatan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as possessive pronouns, subject and object prefixes, and postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Possessive Pronouns and Prefixes**:
   - Inanwatan uses both free and bound possessive pronouns to indicate possession (Paragraphs 3, 12, 28, 29). The bound forms occur with inalienable nouns, while free forms are used with alienable nouns. This indicates a system of possessive marking rather than a case system.

2. **Subject and Object Prefixes**:
   - The language employs subject and object prefixes on verbs to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns (Paragraphs 4, 11, 27). These prefixes are used to mark the subject and object within the verb complex, rather than using separate case markers on the nouns themselves.

3. **Postpositions**:
   - Inanwatan uses postpositions to mark peripheral roles such as location, direction, and accompaniment (Paragraphs 30, 47). Examples include -wai 'to(wards)', -wo 'in, at', and -(u)ru 'with'. These postpositions function similarly to cases in other languages but are not integrated into a case-marking paradigm for nouns.

4. **Lack of Morphological Case Marking**:
   - There is no mention of a morphological case system that marks nouns for roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, grammatical relationships are indicated through the use of prefixes, possessive forms, and postpositions.

Given this information, it is clear that Inanwatan does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses other grammatical strategies to indicate relationships between nouns and other sentence elements.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the pragmatic structure of Abui and mentions a case marker in the neighboring language Kabola. However, it does not provide explicit information about the number of cases in Abui.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the structure of noun phrases (NPs) in Abui, including the use of possessive prefixes and modifier nouns.

121. **Paragraph 122**:",5 cases,no morphological case-marking
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in Mpur:

1. **Paragraph 1 and 2**: These paragraphs discuss the use of spatial nouns and person prefixes attached to body part terms to indicate spatial relations. This suggests the presence of locative constructions but does not indicate a full-fledged case system.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph describes the types of nouns and their possessive inflection. It mentions possessive inflection by means of bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and the use of verbs for alienable possession. This indicates possessive marking but not necessarily a case system.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses verb sequences and the potential for verb serialization, which is more related to verb morphology than noun case marking.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Describes free and bound pronouns, with bound pronouns used as subject markers on verbs and possessive markers on inalienable nouns. This again points to possessive marking rather than a case system.

5. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses spatial orientation and the use of spatial relator nouns and prepositions to specify spatial relations. This indicates the use of locative phrases but does not suggest a comprehensive case system.

6. **Paragraph 17**: Mentions inalienable nouns requiring a prefix for person and number of the possessor, indicating possessive marking.

7. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses the use of prepositions and spatial nouns in locative phrases, further supporting the use of locative constructions rather than a case system.

8. **Paragraph 23**: Describes the use of spatial nouns in locative phrases, reinforcing the presence of locative constructions.

9. **Paragraph 31**: Mentions the use of directional prepositions with spatial nouns prefixed with person markers, indicating locative and directional marking.

10. **Paragraph 32**: Provides examples of locative phrases with spatial nouns, further supporting the use of locative constructions.

From these observations, it is clear that Mpur uses spatial nouns and prepositions to indicate locative and directional relations, and possessive prefixes for possession. However, there is no evidence of a comprehensive morphological case system that marks syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

**Reasoning**:
- The language uses prepositions and spatial nouns to indicate locative and directional relations.
- Possessive marking is done through prefixes on inalienable nouns.
- There is no evidence of a full-fledged case system marking syntactic roles.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Mehek:

1. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses the locative/instrumental clitic `=k`, which functions as a case marker covering locative and instrumental meanings. This clitic cannot co-occur with noun phrase clitics coding number and gender, indicating it functions as a separate case marker.

2. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions relational nouns like `kana` ('with') and `yungu` ('like'), which can signal semantic relationships between noun phrases and verbs, similar to postpositions in other languages. These relational nouns might be analyzed as postpositions rather than true case markers.

3. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses the use of relational nouns and the locative/instrumental clitic `=k` in animal and plant names, reinforcing the locative/instrumental case marking.

4. **Paragraph 10**: Provides an example of a relational noun phrase modifying a noun, showing that relational nouns can behave like adjectives or possessive pronouns but do not function as primary case markers.

5. **Paragraph 24**: Describes the structure of noun phrases, including the use of relational noun phrases and the locative/instrumental clitic `=k`.

6. **Paragraph 30**: Mentions the use of the locative clitic `=k` in interrogative expressions like `iroko=k` ('where=LOC').

7. **Paragraph 31**: Discusses the linguistic scene and language vitality, but does not provide specific information on case marking.

8. **Paragraph 35**: Mentions the use of light verbs but does not provide relevant information on case marking.

9. **Paragraph 36**: Discusses the use of Tok Pisin borrowings and code-switching, which is not directly relevant to case marking.

10. **Paragraph 37**: Provides an overview of pronouns but does not discuss case marking.

11. **Paragraph 38**: Discusses allophones and phonological aspects, not directly relevant to case marking.

12. **Paragraph 39**: Provides an introduction to nouns and noun phrases, mentioning that nouns do not have inflectional morphology, which implies limited case marking.

13. **Paragraph 40**: Discusses passive clauses and their structure, which is not directly relevant to case marking.

14. **Paragraph 41**: Mentions the use of mood particles and conditional suffixes, not directly relevant to case marking.

15. **Paragraph 42**: Discusses temporal adverbs, not directly relevant to case marking.

16. **Paragraph 43**: Discusses word order and the placement of subjects and objects, not directly relevant to case marking.

17. **Paragraph 44**: Discusses possessive pronouns and their placement, not directly relevant to case marking.

18. **Paragraph 45**: Provides examples of numerals and their placement, not directly relevant to case marking.

19. **Paragraph 46**: Discusses the use of predicate clitics and subject suffixes, not directly relevant to case marking.

20. **Paragraph 47**: Discusses the syntax of linked clauses, not directly relevant to case marking.

21. **Paragraph 48**: Provides examples of passive sentences, not directly relevant to case marking.

22. **Paragraph 49**: Discusses the use of negative suffixes, not directly relevant to case marking.

23. **Paragraph 50**: Discusses phonotactics and consonant clusters, not directly relevant to case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Mehek has a locative/instrumental clitic `=k` that functions as a case marker. Additionally, relational nouns like `kana` ('with') and `yungu` ('like') signal semantic relationships but are more akin to postpositions. Therefore, Mehek primarily uses overt marking for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals.

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, the following points are relevant to determining the number of productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It is explicitly mentioned that ""No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject."" The grammatical relations of Subject, Object, etc., are marked by word order alone.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It reiterates that Abun does not mark the case of nouns and that grammatical relations are marked by word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: It states that Abun is an isolating language with very little affixation, and grammatical relations are defined by word order and prepositions for obliques.

4. **Paragraph 7**: It confirms that there is no case marking on nouns and that the object is distinguished from the subject solely by word order.

5. **Paragraph 11**: It discusses the grammatical relations hierarchy in Abun and mentions that subjects and objects are marked by word order, while indirect objects and obliques are marked by prepositions.

6. **Paragraph 17**: It mentions that all Abun pronouns are invariant in form, whether they refer to the subject, object, or possessor, indicating no morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 19**: It states that Abun uses prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking.

8. **Paragraph 22**: It discusses negation strategies and mentions the use of particles rather than morphological changes.

9. **Paragraph 30**: It describes prepositional phrases filling various grammatical roles, indicating the use of prepositions rather than case marking.

10. **Paragraph 44**: It mentions the use of locative prepositions to join clauses, further indicating the reliance on prepositions rather than case marking.

From these points, it is clear that Abun does not employ morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, the language exhibits a productive case-marking system with several distinct cases. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Koasati nouns have a complicated system of case suffixes.
2. **Paragraph 2** indicates the use of the nominative case marked by the suffix -k.
3. **Paragraph 5** describes the allative case, used to indicate motion towards the noun, marked by a suffix.
4. **Paragraph 6** discusses the autonomous case, which is the form of the noun used in citations and has no suffix.
5. **Paragraph 7** lists the cases in Koasati, including locative and allative.
6. **Paragraph 8** mentions the accusative case marked by the suffix -in.
7. **Paragraph 9** states that there are seven different cases in Koasati, but no noun occurs with more than six.
8. **Paragraph 12** describes the locative case marked by the suffix -fa.
9. **Paragraph 13** mentions the vocative case, marked by deleting the final vowel of the noun.
10. **Paragraph 20** confirms that all nouns take the nominative, accusative, and autonomous cases, and some take additional cases like locative, allative, and inessive.
11. **Paragraph 24** describes the allative case marked by the suffix -fon.
12. **Paragraph 38** describes the inessive case marked by the suffix -hayo.

From the above information, we can identify the following cases in Koasati:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Autonomous
- Locative
- Allative
- Inessive
- Vocative

This totals to seven distinct cases. Therefore, the number of cases in Koasati falls into the ""6-7 cases"" category.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Maricopa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maricopa, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the information about case marking on nouns.

1. **Paragraph 7** mentions that the grammatical role filled by a noun phrase within a predication is signaled by the case suffix at the end of the noun phrase.
2. **Paragraph 14** states that the role of a noun phrase within the predication is indicated by a case suffix which is attached to the end of the entire noun phrase.
3. **Paragraph 39** lists the noun case markers found in Maricopa:
   - **-sh**: subject, predicate noun
   - **0**: object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject predicate nominal and nominalized clauses
   - **-m**: comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topic of', 'by way of', directional
   - **-li**: locative (at) and illative (to/toward)
   - **-ly**: locative (in/on) and illative (into/to)
   - **-k**: general locative and directional

From this information, we can see that Maricopa has a productive case system with the following cases:
- Subject
- Object (direct and indirect)
- Comitative/Instrumental
- Locative/Illative (with different suffixes for different locative nuances)
- General Locative/Directional

This gives us a total of at least 6 distinct cases, which fall into the category of 6-7 cases.

### Reasoning:
The detailed enumeration of case markers and their specific functions in the provided paragraphs indicates that Maricopa has a well-defined system of case marking that includes at least six distinct cases. This system is productive and covers a range of syntactic and semantic roles, including subject, object, comitative, instrumental, and various locative functions.

### Conclusion:

7. **Ablative Case**: Paragraph 36 mentions the ablative case, which indicates movement away from something.
8. **Allative Case**: Paragraph 31 mentions the allative case, which indicates movement towards something.

Given this information, Southern Sierra Miwok has a productive case system with at least eight distinct cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, instrumental, temporal, locative, ablative, and allative.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has explicit morphological markers for these cases, as evidenced by the provided examples and descriptions.
- The cases cover a range of syntactic and semantic functions, indicating a robust and productive case system.

**Conclusion**: 8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Nez Perce,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information about the case system in Nez Perce:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions ""ergative case"" and ""direct object"" markers, indicating the presence of at least two cases: ergative and accusative (or direct object).
2. **Paragraph 5** refers to ""locative and direct object cases,"" suggesting the presence of a locative case.
3. **Paragraph 9** discusses the ""ablative"" case, indicating another distinct case.
4. **Paragraph 11** mentions ""Genitive promoted to direct object,"" indicating the presence of a genitive case.
5. **Paragraph 17** states, ""A dative case is totally lacking in Nez Perce,"" which implies that the dative case is not present.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Nez Perce:
- Ergative
- Accusative (or direct object)
- Locative
- Ablative
- Genitive

This gives us a total of five productive cases.

### Reasoning:

### Conclusion:
5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Oneida, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Possessive Prefixes (Paragraph 9)**:
   - Oneida uses possessive prefixes on nouns to indicate possession. These prefixes replace the noun prefixes and are similar to objective pronominal prefixes used on verbs.
   - Examples include: ""ak-"" for ""my,"" ""sa-"" for ""your,"" ""la-"" for ""his,"" etc.

2. **Locative Suffixes (Paragraph 4)**:
   - Oneida has locative suffixes such as ""-ke"" and ""-hne"" which are used to indicate location. These suffixes attach to nouns to specify spatial relations like ""on,"" ""in,"" or ""under.""

3. **Noun Suffixes (Paragraph 4)**:
   - There are various noun suffixes with specialized meanings, including plural suffixes and others that indicate population, customary actions, augmentation, decessive state, and characterization.

4. **Semantic Roles (Paragraph 4)**:
   - Semantic roles like possessive and locative are expressed in the noun morphology but are not typically marked on the nouns themselves. Instead, these roles are often encoded in the pronominal prefixes of the verb.

5. **Absence of Case Paradigms**:
   - The text does not mention any productive case paradigms for marking syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc., on nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on pronominal prefixes and suffixes to convey relationships and roles.

6. **Pronominal Prefixes (Paragraph 3)**:
   - The pronominal prefixes in Oneida are rich and encode various grammatical distinctions, including person, number, gender, and semantic roles like agent and patient.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, Oneida does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses pronominal prefixes and various suffixes to indicate possession, location, and other semantic roles. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Oneida in terms of morphological case-marking is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"Based on the provided paragraphs, here is the analysis to determine the number of cases in Southeastern Pomo:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions suffixes like ""-it"" and ""-baq"" but does not provide clear information on the number of cases.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses suffixes for possession and locative, such as ""-it+baq"" for possession and ""-y"" for locative. This indicates some form of case marking.
3. **Paragraph 5**: Lists various suffixes related to grammatical relations, including subject, object, and possessive forms. This suggests a system of case marking.
4. **Paragraph 31**: Provides examples of benefactive suffixes like ""-itib"" and mentions nominal subclasses, indicating a structured case system.
5. **Paragraph 38**: Details various suffixes for subject, object, and possessive forms, indicating a complex case system.
6. **Paragraph 37**: Mentions locative suffixes and other grammatical relations, reinforcing the presence of case marking.
7. **Paragraph 36**: Talks about absolutive suffixes, which are part of a case system.
8. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses concordance and transformations involving noun phrases, implying a structured case system.
9. **Paragraph 27**: Mentions evidential and interrogative suffixes but does not directly contribute to the case system analysis.
10. **Paragraph 25**: Discusses kinship terms and their morphological integration, which might suggest additional case-like markers.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Southeastern Pomo has a productive case system with multiple suffixes indicating various grammatical relations such as subject, object, possessive, benefactive, and locative. The presence of these multiple suffixes suggests a relatively complex case system.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct suffixes for different grammatical relations, including subject, object, possessive, benefactive, and locative.
- The presence of multiple suffixes for different cases indicates a structured and productive case system.
- The examples provided show that these suffixes are used consistently to mark grammatical relations.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Slave,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Slave exhibits the following characteristics relevant to case-marking:

1. **Possessive Constructions**: There are possessive suffixes such as -e for alienable possession and high tone for inalienable possession (Paragraph 46). This indicates some form of morphological marking for possession, which can be considered a type of genitive case.

2. **Postpositions and Oblique Objects**: The language uses postpositions to mark oblique objects (Paragraph 4). This suggests that spatial and other peripheral relations are marked by postpositions rather than cases.

3. **Coreference and Pronouns**: There is a detailed discussion of coreference involving pronouns and nouns, but no explicit mention of morphological case-marking for subjects or objects (Paragraphs 3, 4, 8, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

4. **Verb Agreement and Classifiers**: The language has a complex system of verb agreement and classifiers that affect the syntactic roles of nouns, but this does not constitute morphological case-marking (Paragraphs 7, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

5. **Lack of Explicit Case Paradigms**: There is no mention of explicit case paradigms for marking nominative, accusative, dative, or other core grammatical relations on nouns.

6. **Peripheral Case Relations**: The language uses postpositions for marking peripheral relations such as location and instrumentality (Paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The language Slave does not have a productive case paradigm for marking core grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions for marking peripheral relations and possessive suffixes for genitive-like constructions. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Slave is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Tunica by examining the morphological case-marking of nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the use of nouns in the non-definitive case of the determinative category and the locative case.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
3. **Paragraph 3** reiterates that the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
4. **Paragraph 11** describes the locative suffixes used in the formation of the locative case.
5. **Paragraph 12** confirms the three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

From these points, it is clear that Tunica has a productive case paradigm for nouns that includes three distinct cases: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Washo. The term ""case"" appears frequently, but it is used in a general sense rather than indicating specific grammatical cases. The paragraphs discuss various linguistic phenomena, such as morphophonemic changes, verb derivations, and pronoun usage, but none of them provide concrete examples of morphological case-marking on nouns.

Given the absence of explicit mention of a case system or examples of case-marked nouns, it is reasonable to conclude that Washo does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wichita,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Wichita. The paragraphs mention various grammatical elements and structures, including verb forms, participles, and locative markers, but there is no indication of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, the language seems to rely on other grammatical mechanisms to indicate relationships between nouns and verbs.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Paragraphs discuss verb forms, participles, and locative markers but do not mention a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that marks nouns for different grammatical functions.
   - The language appears to use other grammatical structures to convey relationships between nouns and verbs.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wintu, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions three cases for inalienably possessed nouns: object, possessive, and instrumental. It also mentions that both possessive and instrumental functions are marked by a single case, the genitive, for alienably possessed nouns.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that nouns are inflected for three morphological cases.
3. **Paragraph 6** lists the case suffixes: object case suffix {um}, genitive case suffix {un}, locative case suffix {in}, instrumental case suffix {r}, and possessive case suffix {t}.
4. **Paragraph 7** describes the relational role of morphological cases in marking subjects, objects, instrumentality, location, and possession.
5. **Paragraph 8** mentions the object case suffix {urn}.
6. **Paragraph 10** states that non-possessed nouns are maximally inflected for three cases.
7. **Paragraph 14** lists the object case suffix {um}, pronominal possessive case suffix {t}, instrumental case suffix {r}, and locative case suffix {in}.
8. **Paragraph 17** mentions that alienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, genitive, and locative.
9. **Paragraph 22** states that nouns are inflected for one, two, or four morphological cases.
10. **Paragraph 31** mentions that pronouns distinguish six cases: subject, object, dependent possessive, independent possessive, instrumental, and locative.

From the above information, it is clear that Wintu has a productive case system that includes at least the following cases: object, genitive, locative, instrumental, and possessive. This indicates that Wintu has more than four cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",4 cases,6-7 cases
Acoma,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the morphological case-marking system of the Acoma language. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 7**: ""Nouns do not distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for a possessor, with distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession.""
   - This indicates that Acoma nouns do not have morphological case-marking for syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, etc.

2. **Paragraph 14**: ""Laguna marks two roles morphologically: actor and undergoer. The actor corresponds to the subject in all cases except with impersonal verbs where it is simply a dummy argument. The undergoer corresponds to the subject with intransitive verbs, to the object with transitive verbs, and to the recipient with ditransitive verbs.""
   - This suggests that the language uses a system to mark roles on verbs rather than on nouns, which aligns with a lack of nominal case-marking.

3. **Paragraph 23**: ""It is for this reason that Laguna cannot be analyzed as having a fourth person or an obviative, as Miller and Valiquette have done. In true obviative systems, such as those in Algonquian languages, the distinction between the third and fourth person is maintained across both (di)transitive and intransitive clauses, which is not the case in Laguna.""
   - This further supports the idea that Acoma does not use nominal case-marking but rather relies on verbal morphology to indicate roles.

4. **Paragraph 25**: ""In this case, possession is expressed indirectly by means of an appositional construction involving the nominalized verb stem -adyaashe 'someone's pet' along with the name of the animal that is being possessed.""
   - This indicates that possession is marked differently and does not imply a case system for nouns.

5. **Paragraph 50**: ""Table 7.2: Summary of the uses PRMP sets A, B and C. There are several issues which this description raises: 1. The Set A prefixes seem to basically be subject prefixes, even in the case of Impersonal verbs which have no subject either syntactically or semantically. Yet, with transitive and ditransitive verbs they also seem to code for a third person argument, either object or recipient.""
   - This reinforces the idea that roles are marked on verbs rather than nouns.

From the above analysis, it is clear that Acoma does not use morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on verbal morphology to indicate grammatical roles.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aleut, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses the transformation of the ergative system in Aleut and mentions the use of pronominal forms and demonstrative pronouns. It does not provide specific information about the number of cases.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions the relative suffixes and the lack of dual forms in Eastern Aleut. It indicates that there is no case distinction for the 1.p. and for the sg. 2. and 3R pl. possessum in any dialect.

3. **Paragraph 6**: States that Aleut has two grammatical (relational) cases, absolutive and relative, for ordinary nouns and most pronouns. It also mentions that Aleut has only two local cases, locative and ablative, for positional nouns and certain adverbs.

4. **Paragraph 17**: Confirms that ordinary nouns in Aleut have suffixes for number (singular, dual, plural), relational case (absolutive, relative), and possessive suffixes. It reiterates the presence of absolutive and relative cases.

5. **Paragraph 32**: Discusses positional nouns having one or two adverbial cases (locative and/or ablative) and their derivatives.

6. **Paragraph 40**: Mentions the use of possessive suffixes and the relative and absolutive cases. It also discusses the reduction of the case system in young Atkans to a singular and a plural without case distinction.

From these points, we can conclude that Aleut has a minimal case system for ordinary nouns, consisting of two primary grammatical cases (absolutive and relative) and additional local cases (locative and ablative) for positional nouns and certain adverbs. The presence of these cases indicates that Aleut does not have an extensive case system but does have productive case paradigms.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",2 cases,4 cases

Yup'ik (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Yup'ik, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the terminalis case for personal pronouns.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the absolutive and relative cases, indicating their use for subjects and objects in transitive and intransitive verbs.
3. **Paragraph 3** introduces the ablative-modalis case.
4. **Paragraph 4** mentions the terminalis and localis cases.
5. **Paragraph 6** further elaborates on the ablative-modalis case.
6. **Paragraph 14** discusses the localis case.
7. **Paragraph 15** discusses the terminalis case.
8. **Paragraph 16** introduces the vialis and equalis cases.
9. **Paragraph 23** summarizes the uses of the absolutive, relative, and ablative-modalis cases.
10. **Paragraph 42** provides a table of localis case endings and mentions the terminalis and ablative-modalis cases.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Central Yup'ik:
- Absolutive
- Relative
- Ablative-modalis
- Terminalis
- Localis
- Vialis
- Equalis

This gives us a total of seven distinct cases. Given the options provided, the best fit is:

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The information provided discusses various aspects of Yurok grammar, such as verb forms, pronominal prefixes, word order, and other morphological and syntactic features, but it does not indicate the presence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

The closest references to noun forms involve pronominal prefixes and locative forms, but these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of grammatical case. The locative forms mentioned are specific to indicating location rather than serving as part of a broader case system that marks different grammatical relations.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Zuni,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that ""pronouns are inflected for number and case.""
2. **Paragraph 3** provides a table of personal pronouns, showing differentiation for number (singular, dual, plural) and for case (subject, object, possessive).
3. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that ""pronoun inflection includes case as well as number.""
4. **Paragraph 11** specifies that Zuni has three pronouns of person, differentiated for number and for case (subject, object, possessive).

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Zuni has a productive case paradigm for pronouns, specifically marking subject, object, and possessive cases. However, there is no mention of additional cases for nouns beyond these three. Therefore, Zuni has a system of three cases.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Columbia-Wenatchi, we can infer the following about the case system:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the ""absolutive case"" for the subject of the predicate 'eat'.
2. **Paragraph 10** refers to ""direct case"" for the agent and ""oblique"" for the patient.
3. **Paragraph 11** also mentions ""direct case"" for both agent and patient in certain constructions.
4. **Paragraph 22** discusses ""quirky case"" for topical object agents, which is a noted property of ergative arguments.
5. **Paragraph 25** mentions ""ergative case"" for agents of transitive verbs and ""absolutive"" for agents of intransitives.
6. **Paragraph 28** mentions ""locative"" being case-marked as the direct object.
7. **Paragraph 45** refers to ""quirky case"" for ergative arguments in topical object constructions.
8. **Paragraph 50** discusses ""absolutive case"" and ""oblique"" marking for ergative arguments.

From these references, it is clear that Columbia-Wenatchi has a productive case system that includes at least the following cases:
- Absolutive
- Ergative
- Direct
- Oblique
- Locative

Given this information, Columbia-Wenatchi appears to have at least five distinct cases. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is:

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",no morphological case-marking,5 cases
Tlingit,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tlingit, the language exhibits characteristics that align with the feature value ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" Here is the reasoning:

1. **Locative and Instrumental Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the ""adessive"" and ""locative"" forms, indicating that there are specific markers for locative relations.
   - Paragraph 5 discusses locative phrases functioning similarly to nominal phrases as objects, further emphasizing the presence of locative markers.
   - Paragraph 6 defines locative phrases and their functions, showing that locative markers are a significant part of the language's grammar.

2. **Absence of Core Grammatical Cases**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions limited inflectional suffixation among nominal and locative words, suggesting that core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative) are not marked morphologically.
   - Paragraph 10 describes the nominal phrase functioning as subject, object, and indirect object without mentioning specific case markers for these roles, implying that these roles are not marked by distinct morphological cases.

3. **Productivity and Distribution**:
   - Paragraph 12 discusses multiple occurrences of nominal phrases and locative adverbial phrases, indicating that while locative markers are productive, there is no mention of a broader case system for marking core grammatical relations.
   - Paragraph 22 further supports this by detailing the nominal phrase functioning as object and indirect object without specific case markers, reinforcing the idea that core grammatical roles are not morphologically marked.

4. **Semantic Case Relations**:
   - Paragraph 45 and 46 discuss locative phrases functioning as adverbial phrases with situational and adjunctival markers, highlighting the use of semantic case relations rather than syntactic ones.

In conclusion, Tlingit uses specific markers for locative and possibly other peripheral relations but does not have a productive case system for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative. Therefore, the appropriate classification is:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, the following points are relevant for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Obviative and Proximate Distinctions**:
   - The language makes a distinction between proximate (focus of attention) and obviative (distanced) animate nouns and pronouns. This is a common feature in Algonquian languages and is used to manage discourse prominence rather than syntactic roles.
   - Example: ""Mali '·kost!lom·a·l wasfs·ol 'Mary (proximate) loves the child (obviative)'"".

2. **Possessed Forms**:
   - Possession is marked on the noun being possessed rather than on the possessor. Possessed nouns take specific inflections.
   - Example: ""n·itap (1-friend.dep) 'my friend', k·itap·iyik (2-friend.dep-3.pl) 'your friends' (prox.)"".

3. **Locative Inflection**:
   - Nouns can take locative endings to indicate location.
   - Example: ""wikuwamok 'in, on, at the house'"".

4. **Absentative Forms**:
   - There are absentative forms indicating absence in time or space.
   - Example: ""Piyel mfhtaqsokol 'Peter's late father'"".

5. **Diminutive and Feminine Suffixes**:
   - Nouns can take diminutive and feminine suffixes.
   - Example: ""mahtoqehsis 'little hare'"".

6. **No Mention of Core Grammatical Cases**:
   - There is no mention of core grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive that would indicate a productive case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet does not have a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations (such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.) on nouns. Instead, it uses other morphological means such as obviation, possession markers, locative suffixes, and absentative forms. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs, Tsimshian (Coast) exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment. The language distinguishes between ergative and absolutive cases, where the absolutive case is used for the subjects of intransitive sentences and the direct objects of transitive sentences, while the ergative case is used for the subjects of transitive sentences.

Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Tsimshian does not have subjects and objects in the same way as English. Instead, it uses absolutive and ergative cases. The subjects of intransitive sentences and the direct objects of transitive sentences are both considered absolutives, while the subjects of transitive sentences are ergatives.

2. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses topicalization of ergatives, indicating that ergative case marking is a significant grammatical feature.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions topical absolutive pronouns, reinforcing the presence of the absolutive case.

4. **Paragraph 16**: Provides examples of sentence structures with ergative and absolutive cases, showing how they are marked in different sentence types.

5. **Paragraph 33**: Further examples of sentences with ergative and absolutive cases, showing the use of enclitics and suffixes to mark these cases.

From these points, it is clear that Tsimshian (Coast) has a productive case system with at least two distinct cases: ergative and absolutive. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs of additional cases beyond these two.

**Reasoning**: The language has a clear distinction between ergative and absolutive cases, which are used productively to mark grammatical relations in sentences. There is no mention of additional cases such as dative, genitive, or instrumental in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion**: 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tetelcingo Nahuatl, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses pluralization and absolutive marking but does not mention case marking.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Mentions possessor pronouns and subject prefixes but does not indicate a productive case system.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Shows examples of noun phrases and their possessive constructions, but no clear case marking.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses postpositions and their attachment to possessor pronouns, indicating locative and instrumental relations, but these are not integrated into a case system.
5. **Paragraph 6**: Talks about pronominal subjects and objects marked on verbs, not cases.
6. **Paragraph 10**: Mentions number agreement and reduplication but no case marking.
7. **Paragraph 12**: Describes causative constructions, not cases.
8. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses pronouns and their uses for emphasis and topicalization, not cases.
9. **Paragraph 25**: Mentions applicative forms and verb morphology, not cases.
10. **Paragraph 27**: Lists locative expressions but these are not part of a case system.
11. **Paragraph 28**: Discusses pronominal elements and their order in verbs, not cases.
12. **Paragraph 33**: Describes relative clauses and possessive constructions, not cases.
13. **Paragraph 37**: Mentions postpositions and their usage, indicating locative relations but not a case system.

From these points, it is clear that Tetelcingo Nahuatl uses postpositions and pronominal affixes to indicate relations such as possession, location, and instrumentality. However, these do not constitute a productive case system for nouns. Instead, the language relies on other grammatical means to express these relations.

### Reasoning:
Tetelcingo Nahuatl does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions and pronominal affixes to indicate various grammatical relations. These markers are not integrated into a case system but function independently to show possession, location, and other relations.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abkhaz, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the ""predicative case"" in -s, which is used for noun-complements in copular sentences.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of the predicative case in questions formed on nouns.
3. **Paragraph 6** refers to the use of the predicative case in reflexive constructions.
4. **Paragraph 7** again mentions the predicative case in copular sentences.
5. **Paragraph 17** indicates the use of the predicative case in quantified noun phrases.
6. **Paragraph 21** discusses the predicative case in coordination structures.
7. **Paragraph 24** mentions the instrumental suffix -la used in certain constructions.
8. **Paragraph 39** refers to the instrumental postposition -la used with masdars.

From these observations, it is clear that Abkhaz has a productive case system that includes at least the predicative case and the instrumental case. However, there is no mention of other cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive in the provided paragraphs. The predicative case appears to be used extensively in various syntactic constructions, and the instrumental case is used for marking instruments and agents in passive constructions.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for the number of cases in Abkhaz is:

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking

This classification is chosen because the language has overt marking for specific semantic relations (predicative and instrumental) but does not exhibit a full-fledged case system with multiple syntactic cases like nominative, accusative, or dative.",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Eastern Armenian by examining the morphological case-marking of nouns. The relevant information is found in the following paragraphs:

**Paragraph 2:**
- Mentions five case forms: NOM (Nominative), DAT (Dative), ABL (Ablative), INST (Instrumental), and LOC (Locative).

**Paragraph 4:**
- Provides additional details on the endings for each case:
  - NOM: zero ending (unmarked)
  - DAT: various endings depending on declension type
  - ABL: ends in {-ic}
  - INST: ends in {-ov}
  - LOC: ends in {-um}

**Paragraph 5:**
- Confirms the declension of deadjectival nouns in the same five cases: NOM, DAT, ABL, INST, LOC.

**Paragraph 8:**
- Mentions that prepositions and postpositions govern noun forms of different cases, reinforcing the existence of the five cases.

**Paragraph 10:**
- Declension of numerals also follows the same five cases: NOM, DAT, ABL, INST, LOC.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Eastern Armenian has a productive case system with five distinct cases: Nominative, Dative, Ablative, Instrumental, and Locative.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Catalan, there is no evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The information provided discusses various grammatical aspects such as pronominal verbs, gender of nouns, prepositions, and the use of articles, but it does not mention any morphological case paradigms for nouns. 

Catalan, like other Romance languages, primarily relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships rather than inflectional case markings. The examples provided show the use of prepositions (e.g., ""a,"" ""de,"" ""per"") to indicate relationships such as possession, direction, and indirect objects, which are typical in languages without morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Western Frisian, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking of nouns.

1. **Paragraph 1** states that ""nouns in Frisian are essentially undeclined"" and mentions that the function of a noun in a sentence is indicated by its position rather than by its case. This strongly suggests that Frisian does not have a productive case system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 2** mentions ""relics of a more elaborate case system"" and provides examples such as ""des Heare"" (of the Lord) and ""mei der tiid"" (in time). These relics are described as isolated and not significant in the modern language, further indicating that the case system is not productive.

3. **Paragraph 4** discusses reflexive pronouns and the use of -sels for emphasis, but it does not indicate a productive case system for nouns.

4. **Paragraph 10** mentions the use of diminutives and other morphological processes but does not provide evidence of a productive case system.

Hunzib,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hunzib, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several syntactic cases including nominative, ergative, genitive, instrumental, and dative.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses the use of nominative and oblique cases in pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 4** details the formation of oblique stems and mentions seven local endings that can be followed by directional suffixes.
4. **Paragraph 5** describes the use of adjectives in nominative and oblique cases.
5. **Paragraph 7** lists various oblique markers and mentions the ergative, genitive, instrumental, and local endings.
6. **Paragraph 10** provides an example of an allative form.
7. **Paragraph 11** mentions the use of genitive and instrumental cases for possession.
8. **Paragraph 20** lists several local endings including dative, adessive, superessive, subessive, contactive, and comitative.
9. **Paragraph 25** discusses the use of the ergative and instrumental cases.
10. **Paragraph 31** provides a chart of local endings including dative, adessive, superessive, subessive, contactive, and comitative.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Hunzib:
- Nominative
- Ergative
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Dative
- Adessive
- Superessive
- Subessive
- Contactive
- Comitative

This gives us a total of 10 or more productive cases.

**Reasoning:**
The paragraphs provide evidence of at least ten distinct cases being used productively in the language, including syntactic and local cases. The presence of multiple local cases (dative, adessive, superessive, subessive, contactive, comitative) in addition to the core syntactic cases (nominative, ergative, genitive, instrumental) supports the conclusion that Hunzib has a rich case system with 10 or more cases.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayah Li (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kayah Li (Eastern), we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions that there is no marking of nouns for case, number, or gender. This is a strong indication that Kayah Li does not employ morphological case marking for syntactic roles such as subject, object, or indirect object.

2. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 2** discuss grammatical relations like Subject, Object, and Indirect Object but do not mention any specific morphological markers for these roles. Instead, the language relies on word order and other syntactic structures.

3. **Paragraph 11** and **Paragraph 14** discuss the use of prepositions and locative expressions, indicating that locative and other peripheral roles are expressed through prepositions rather than case markers.

4. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 49** describe the use of the preposition ""né"" to indicate backgrounded participants, which can sometimes function similarly to oblique cases in other languages. However, this is not a productive case paradigm but rather a specific syntactic construction.

5. **Paragraph 6** explicitly states that there is no inflectional morphology of any kind, which includes case marking.

6. **Paragraph 50** discusses possessive constructions and the use of nominal modifiers, again without mentioning any morphological case markers.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Kayah Li (Eastern) does not employ morphological case marking for syntactic roles such as subject, object, or indirect object. The language uses prepositions for locative and other peripheral roles, and there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Khanty,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Khanty, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that personal pronouns inflect for three cases: Nominative, Accusative-Dative, and Locative. However, this information is specific to personal pronouns and does not necessarily reflect the full case system for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 7** provides more comprehensive information about the case system for nouns. It mentions the unmarked Nominative, the Locative in -na, and the Translative with the affix -ji or -Ci. This gives us three cases explicitly.

3. **Paragraph 16** states that the morphology of eastern Ostyak (a dialect of Khanty) possesses a more complicated system of case marking with about 10-11 cases, as distinct from 3 or 4 in the northern dialects. This indicates significant dialectal variation in the number of cases.

4. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 40** discuss the use of cases in various syntactic roles but do not provide additional specific case markers beyond those already mentioned.

Given this information, it is clear that the number of cases in Khanty varies significantly between dialects. The northern dialects have a simpler system with 3 or 4 cases, while the eastern dialects have a more complex system with about 10-11 cases.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases.",3 cases,10 or more cases
Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify several productive case paradigms in Korean. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Lists several grammatical cases including nominative, accusative, dative, static locative, dynamic locative, source, goal, instrument, and directional. It also mentions genitive, comitative, and connective cases. This paragraph indicates a rich system of case marking.

2. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the use of nominative, accusative, and genitive particles, which are termed syntactic cases. It also mentions that these particles are frequently omitted in colloquial speech but are still understood from context.

3. **Paragraph 5**: Mentions the source particle eyse and the dynamic locative particle, indicating that these cases are used to mark specific semantic roles.

4. **Paragraph 9**: Highlights that semantic case particles such as comitative and dynamic locative can co-occur with the genitive particle uy, showing the productivity and flexibility of these case markers.

5. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses the dative case occurring with ditransitive verbs and the static locative case with existential, static, and passive predicates. It also mentions the goal case used with movement verbs.

6. **Paragraph 35**: Lists particles marking dative, locative, goal, and source cases, further supporting the presence of multiple productive cases.

7. **Paragraph 42**: Mentions that Korean particles may be grouped into case particles, delimiters, and conjunctive particles. It lists various case particles including nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, goal, locative (static and dynamic), source, ablative, allative, instrumental, capacity, comitative, connective, comparative, equative, and vocative.

8. **Paragraph 49**: Discusses the ablative case marked by the particle puthe and its compounds, indicating the productivity of this case.

From the analysis, it is clear that Korean has a rich system of productive case paradigms. The cases mentioned include nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative (static and dynamic), source, goal, instrument, directional, comitative, connective, and ablative. This suggests that Korean has more than 10 productive cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Latvian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Latvian, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that traditionally, Latvian grammars have worked with a system of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative. However, the status of the instrumental case is questioned because it occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" (with) and is identical in form to the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural. The conclusion drawn in this paragraph is that modern Latvian does not have a separate instrumental case, reducing the system to six cases.

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates the syntactic functions of the oblique cases in Latvian, which include adnominal, adverbal, and adverbial functions. This supports the presence of multiple cases but does not contradict the six-case system mentioned earlier.

3. **Paragraph 21** mentions the genitive, accusative, dative, locative, nominative, and vocative cases, aligning with the six-case system.

4. **Paragraph 48** discusses case government by prepositions and mentions the genitive, accusative, and dative cases, while noting that the locative, nominative, and vocative cannot be governed by prepositions. This again supports the six-case system.

5. **Paragraph 2** also mentions that the instrumental case is not considered separate in modern Latvian, which aligns with the six-case system.

Given this information, the productive case paradigms of nouns in Latvian are:

- Nominative
- Genitive
- Dative
- Accusative
- Locative
- Vocative

The instrumental case is not considered a separate productive case in modern Latvian.

### Conclusion:

Mundari,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mundari, we can analyze the presence and nature of case marking in the language.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions case markings of nouns indicating syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions. However, it does not specify the number of cases or provide detailed examples.
2. **Paragraph 3** explicitly states that Mundari is not an inflectional language and that both the subject and object of a sentence are morphologically unmarked for case. This suggests a lack of traditional case marking for core syntactic roles.
3. **Paragraph 11** indicates that the instrumental case is expressed by the postposition ""te"" following a noun or pronoun, suggesting the presence of postpositional marking for certain semantic roles.
4. **Paragraph 14** discusses various postpositions used to express locative and other semantic functions, such as ""in,"" ""to,"" ""from,"" ""on the side,"" ""vicinity,"" and ""with."" This indicates the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.
5. **Paragraph 15** mentions the possessive suffix ""-a?"" and provides examples of genitive constructions, indicating a form of possessive marking.
6. **Paragraph 19** discusses vocative suffixes, which are not considered part of the case system for this analysis.

From these observations, it is clear that Mundari relies on postpositions to express various semantic roles rather than inflectional case markers. The language does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for marking core syntactic functions like nominative or accusative. Instead, it uses postpositions for peripheral roles such as instrumental, locative, and possessive.

**Reasoning:**
- Mundari does not have inflectional case marking for core syntactic roles (nominative, accusative).
- It uses postpositions for expressing peripheral semantic roles (instrumental, locative, possessive).
- The presence of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Nivkh,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

5. Paragraph 19 and Paragraph 24 provide examples of case usage, including the nominative, locative, and dative/accusative cases.

Given this information, it is clear that Nivkh has a productive case paradigm with a significant number of cases. The exact number of cases varies slightly between dialects, but it falls within the range of 6-7 cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The explicit mention of 8 cases in one dialect and 7 in another.
- The detailed list of case markers provided in the grammar.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",8-9 cases,6-7 cases
Tati (Southern),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Southern Tati, the language exhibits a system of two cases: direct and oblique. Here is the reasoning:

2. **Paragraph 5** reiterates the retention of an oblique case in nouns and pronouns and mentions the extension of an oblique case in -r.
3. **Paragraph 21** confirms that Eshtehardi, a dialect of Southern Tati, has a clear system of two cases, direct and oblique, and suggests that this system is basic to Southern Tati.
4. **Paragraph 48** and **Paragraph 49** discuss the use of the oblique case for agents and objects, further supporting the presence of two cases.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Southern Tati distinguishes between a direct case and an oblique case, used for various grammatical functions such as the genitive, agent, and certain objects.

Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can analyze the presence and function of case markers in the language. Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Oblique Markers**:
   - Paragraphs 1 and 15 discuss oblique markers, which are bound forms that attach to nouns or pronouns to form oblique noun phrases (NPobl). Examples include -kata (associative), -mokaru (goal), and others.
   - These markers indicate peripheral grammatical relations such as instrumental, locative, associative, temporal, goal, contiguous, and causal.

2. **Possession**:
   - Paragraphs 1 and 29 describe how possession is marked in Apurinã. Possessed nouns take specific markers like -te, -ne, -re1, and -re2, which are lexically determined.
   - The possessed markers are not considered cases in the traditional sense but rather markers of possession.

3. **Subject/Object Markers**:
   - Paragraph 32 discusses subject and object pronominal markers, which are bound forms that attach to verbs to indicate the subject or object. These markers are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal coreferential nouns or pronouns.

4. **Non-Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that Apurinã nouns can stand by themselves as the sole nominal expression of a subject or an object without any determiner or case marking.
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that the abbreviation NP refers exclusively to caseless noun phrases.

5. **Summary of Findings**:
   - The language uses oblique markers to indicate peripheral relations, but these are not productive case paradigms for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or dative.
   - The presence of possession markers and subject/object pronominal markers does not constitute a case system but rather specific markers for possession and agreement.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Apurinã does not have a productive case system for core grammatical relations but uses oblique markers for peripheral relations. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Apurinã is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

1. **Case Marking Overview**:
   - Awa Pit employs postpositions rather than case suffixes to mark grammatical relations.
   - The language uses a nominative-accusative system, with nominative (unmarked) for subjects and accusative (marked by postpositions) for objects.

2. **Accusative Marking**:
   - The accusative marker ""ta"" is used to indicate objects, particularly referential human NPs.
   - Singular personal pronouns have special accusative suffixes (e.g., ""wa"" for first and second person, ""a"" for third person).
   - Plural personal pronouns use special accusative clitics.

3. **Possessive Marking**:
   - Possession is indicated by the postposition ""pa"" or possessive adjectives (e.g., ""ap"" for ""my"").
   - There are no special plural possessive adjectives; plural possession is indicated by using singular possessive adjectives or plural pronouns.

4. **Postpositions**:
   - Awa Pit relies heavily on postpositions to indicate various grammatical relations, including locative and instrumental roles.
   - Postpositions are cliticized onto the preceding word, which is usually the final word of an NP.

5. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - The accusative marker ""ta"" and possessive marker ""pa"" are the primary markers for grammatical relations.
   - Other postpositions indicate more concrete or semantic roles, such as location or instrument.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The evidence suggests that Awa Pit does not have a fully productive case paradigm for nouns but relies on postpositions for marking grammatical relations, with specific markers for accusative and possessive cases. Other roles are marked by postpositions that indicate more concrete or semantic relations.",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking

Hixkaryana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hixkaryana, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case paradigms in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the use of postpositional phrases to express possession and other relationships, such as ""rohokyamo"" (my children) and ""rohokru"" (my child). It also describes the use of postpositions like ""ke"" (by means of, with) to express instrumental relations.

2. **Paragraph 13** discusses the expression of subjects and objects in verbs through person-marking prefixes rather than separate case markers on nouns. It mentions that nominal subjects are optional and take the same forms as subjects of intransitive verbs.

3. **Paragraph 16** describes how derived nominals from verbs take different forms for subjects and objects, with subjects of underlying transitives surfacing as postpositional phrases and direct objects marked similarly to possessors in noun phrases.

4. **Paragraph 24** details the use of postpositional phrases for expressing instrumental and benefactive relations, such as ""watma ke"" (with a club) and ""romuru hyaka"" (I bought it for my son).

5. **Paragraph 39** explains that direct objects are always marked in the person prefix of the transitive class, indicating that the language relies on verb morphology rather than noun case marking to indicate grammatical relations.

6. **Paragraph 41** and **Paragraph 40** describe various postpositional relators used to express spatial and other relations, such as ""yosnaka"" (under) and ""hanaka"" (to the side of).

7. **Paragraph 46** mentions the use of detransitivizing prefixes to express reflexive and reciprocal meanings, again focusing on verb morphology rather than noun case marking.

From these points, it is evident that Hixkaryana does not use a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology (person-marking prefixes) and postpositional phrases to express grammatical relations such as subject, object, possession, and various semantic roles (instrumental, benefactive, locative, etc.).

### Reasoning:
- **No morphological case-marking**: The language does not have a productive system of case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it uses verb morphology and postpositional phrases to indicate grammatical relations.
- **Exclusively borderline case-marking**: The language uses postpositions for concrete semantic relations like locatives and instrumentals, but these are not integrated into a case paradigm for nouns.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Paumarí,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, we can identify the following case-marking features:

1. **Ergative Case**: The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the enclitic -a 'ERG' (Paragraphs 1, 3, 7, 9, 19).
2. **Accusative Case**: The object of a transitive verb is marked with the enclitic -ra 'OBJ' (Paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 17, 19).
3. **Oblique Case**: The enclitic -a 'OBL' is used for oblique constituents (Paragraphs 40, 47).

These cases are used productively in the language to mark syntactic relations. The ergative case marks the subject of transitive verbs, the accusative case marks the direct object, and the oblique case marks other peripheral relations.

### Reasoning:
- **Ergative Case**: The ergative marker -a is used to mark the subject of transitive verbs, as seen in multiple examples (e.g., ""mamai-a"" in Paragraph 1).
- **Accusative Case**: The accusative marker -ra is used to mark the direct object, as seen in examples like ""sorara-ra"" (soldiers-OBJ) in Paragraph 4.
- **Oblique Case**: The oblique marker -a is used for other relations, such as locations or indirect objects, as seen in examples like ""kani-a"" (to:place-OBL) in Paragraph 40.

Given these observations, Paumarí has a productive case-marking system with at least three distinct cases: ergative, accusative, and oblique.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",3 cases,3 cases
Pirahã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Pirahã as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order. However, it also notes the presence of morphological markers for oblique relations, specifically mentioning the instrumental case marked by `-oal-ai` and the locative or general oblique case marked by `-o`. This indicates that there are specific markers for certain oblique cases but not for core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative.

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph reiterates that oblique case is generally shown by the suffix `-o`, reinforcing the idea that case marking in Pirahã is limited to oblique relations.

3. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph provides examples of locative case marking with `-o` and mentions the possibility of double occurrence of this suffix within postpositional phrases, further emphasizing the use of case marking for locative relations.

4. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph discusses the nominalizing suffix `-sai`, which transforms verbs into nominals but does not indicate additional case marking functions.

5. **Paragraph 1 (continued)**: The paragraph also mentions that no affix has been observed to mark participants or grammatical relations in subordinate clauses, further supporting the idea that case marking is not used for core grammatical relations.

6. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses reflexivity and reciprocity but does not mention any specific case marking for these relations, indicating that such notions are expressed semantically rather than morphologically.

7. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph mentions the use of the conjunctive particle `piaii` and its marking with the oblique suffix `-o`, reinforcing the limited use of case marking to oblique relations.

8. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses possessive phrases and mentions the use of pronominal elements as possible morphological markers of possession but does not indicate a broader case marking system.

9. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses morphophonological processes but does not provide additional information on case marking.

10. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the use of the nominalizer `-sai` in various contexts but does not indicate additional case marking functions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is evident that Pirahã has morphological markers for specific oblique relations (instrumental and locative) but does not have a comprehensive case-marking system for core grammatical relations. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Pirahã's case-marking system is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Quechua (Imbabura),"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imbabura Quechua, we can identify the following productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Nominative Case (0 case marking)**: This is the default case for subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbs, as well as for subjects in copular constructions.
   - Example: ""fluka-ka Juan-ta riku-chi-rka-ni"" (I-topic Juan-acc see-causative-past 1) - ""I caused Juan to see.""

2. **Accusative Case (-ta)**: This marks direct objects and is also used for some other functions, such as marking the object of comparison and the object of adjectives like 'happy' and 'sad'.
   - Example: ""Juan-ta ni-rka-ni"" (Juan-acc say-past-1) - ""I told Juan.""

3. **Dative Case (-man)**: This marks indirect objects, indicating the recipient or beneficiary of an action.
   - Example: ""mama-ka Juzi-man muti-ta kara-rka"" (mother-topic José-to boiled corn-acc serve-past 3) - ""Mother served boiled corn to José.""

4. **Genitive Case (-paj)**: This marks possession.
   - Example: ""Juan-paj wasi"" (Juan-possessive house) - ""Juan's house.""

5. **Locative Case (-pi)**: This marks location.
   - Example: ""wasi-pi"" (house-in) - ""in the house.""

6. **Ablative Case (-manda)**: This marks the source or origin.
   - Example: ""Kitu-manda shamu-ni"" (Quito-from come-1) - ""I come from Quito.""

7. **Allative Case (-man)**: This marks the direction towards a goal.
   - Example: ""Utavalu-man ri-ju-ni"" (Otavalo-to go-prog-1) - ""I am going to Otavalo.""

8. **Instrumental Case (-wan)**: This marks the means or instrument by which an action is performed.
   - Example: ""Marya-wan tusu-rka-ni"" (Maria-with dance-past-1) - ""I danced with Maria.""

9. **Comitative Case (-wan)**: This marks accompaniment.
   - Example: ""fiuka-ka warmi-wan ri-rka-ni"" (I-topic woman-with go-past-1) - ""I went with the woman.""

10. **Limitative Case (-lla)**: This marks limitation or restriction.
    - Example: ""Marya-lla-ta juya-ni"" (Maria-just-acc love-1) - ""I love only Maria.""

11. **Benefactive Case (-paj)**: This marks the beneficiary of an action.
    - Example: ""fiuka churi-paj rura-rka-ni"" (my son-benefactive make-past-1) - ""I made it for my son.""

Given the above analysis, Imbabura Quechua has a productive case system with at least 10 distinct cases.

**Conclusion:**
10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Sanuma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sanuma, we can identify several case markers and their functions:

1. **Ergative Marker (-nd)**: This marker is used to indicate the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses, functioning as a morphological ergative marker. It also marks the superordinate subject in stative, intransitive, and semitransitive clauses (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 21).

2. **Instrumental Marker (-nd)**: The same marker -nd is also used to mark instruments in operation clauses (Paragraph 15).

3. **Goal/Locative Marker (niha/ha)**: These markers indicate a goal or destination in motion clauses and can also mark referents in existence clauses (Paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 30).

4. **Possessive Constructions**: Possession is expressed either by possessive pronouns or by noun phrases preceding the possessed item, but these do not constitute separate cases in the traditional sense (Paragraphs 8, 24).

5. **Comitative Marker (kai)**: This marker indicates a subordinate participant in a leader-follower relationship (Paragraph 21).

From the analysis, it is clear that Sanuma has a productive case-marking system that includes at least the ergative, instrumental, and goal/locative cases. The possessive constructions and comitative marker add to the complexity but do not necessarily constitute separate cases in the traditional sense.

**Reasoning**:
- The ergative marker (-nd) is used extensively to mark subjects in various clause types.
- The instrumental use of the same marker (-nd) indicates a distinct case function.
- The goal/locative markers (niha/ha) are used to mark destinations and referents, indicating another distinct case function.

Given the presence of these distinct case markers, Sanuma has at least three productive cases: ergative, instrumental, and goal/locative.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Shipibo-Konibo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are crucial for determining the number of cases in Shipibo-Konibo:

1. **Ergative-Absolutive Pattern**: Shipibo-Konibo exhibits an ergative-absolutive case-marking system. The ergative case is marked overtly, while the absolutive case is marked by zero (Paragraph 1).

2. **Multiple Functions of the Ergative Morpheme**: The ergative morpheme {-n} also marks the genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal functions (Paragraph 1).

3. **Alternative Marking for Locative-Directional and Temporal Functions**: While the ergative morpheme can mark locative-directional and temporal functions, there are alternative ways to mark these functions (Paragraph 1).

4. **Zero Marking for Recipients or Goals**: Zero marking is used for recipients or goals (Paragraph 1).

5. **Examples of Case-Marking**: Examples show the ergative morpheme marking ergative, genitive, and different oblique functions, while zero marking is used for objects and the subject of an intransitive verb (Paragraph 1).

6. **Productive Case Paradigms**: The ergative morpheme is used productively for multiple grammatical relations, indicating a productive case paradigm rather than exclusively borderline case-marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, Shipibo-Konibo has a productive case-marking system with multiple cases. The ergative morpheme marks at least five distinct grammatical relations: ergative, genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal. Additionally, zero marking is used for absolutive and recipients/goals.

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",6-7 cases,5 cases
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Trumai by examining the productive case paradigms of nouns. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the dative markers and their usage based on semantic characteristics of the NP, indicating a productive system for marking dative case.
2. **Paragraph 3**: States that Trumai has an Ergative-Absolutive system with three kinds of obligatory arguments: Ergative, Absolutive, and Dative.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Reiterates the presence of Ergative, Absolutive, and Dative cases and mentions the rich syntax of Trumai.
4. **Paragraph 6**: Lists the case markers in Trumai, including Ergative, Dative, Locative, and Genitive.
5. **Paragraph 14**: Provides a list of grammatical cases, including Ergative, Dative, Locative, and mentions postpositions.
6. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses the rigid case-marking of arguments required by verbs, emphasizing the importance of Ergative, Absolutive, and Dative cases.
7. **Paragraph 40**: Confirms the four categories of verbs based on case-marking patterns: Intransitive, Transitive, Extended Intransitive, and Extended Transitive, with corresponding cases.

From these points, we can identify the following productive cases in Trumai:
- **Ergative**: Used to mark the subject of transitive verbs.
- **Absolutive**: Used to mark the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs.
- **Dative**: Used to mark indirect objects or recipients.
- **Locative**: Used to indicate location.
- **Genitive**: Used to indicate possession.

Additionally, the presence of multiple dative markers and the mention of locative and genitive cases suggest a rich case-marking system.

### Conclusion:
**5 cases**",5 cases,5 cases
Urubú-Kaapor,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urubú-Kaapor, the language exhibits the following characteristics regarding case-marking:

1. **Object Marker ""ke""**: The suffix ""ke"" is used to mark the object in transitive clauses when two nominals occur. This is the only element that might be considered a case marker (Paragraphs 1, 3, 15, 19).
2. **Genitive Constructions**: Possession is expressed through possessive pronouns and nominal phrases, but these do not constitute a productive case paradigm for nouns (Paragraph 4).
3. **Postpositional Phrases**: The language uses postpositions to indicate relationships such as ""to"" (rehe) and ""from"" (ngi), but these are not considered part of a productive case system (Paragraphs 3, 10, 13, 24).

Given the information, Urubú-Kaapor does not have a fully developed system of morphological case-marking for nouns beyond the object marker ""ke"". The genitive constructions and postpositional phrases do not qualify as productive case paradigms.

**Reasoning**:
- The only productive case marker identified is ""ke"" for the object.
- Genitive constructions and postpositional phrases do not constitute a productive case system.
- The language relies more on word order and postpositions rather than a rich case system.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Warao by examining the evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions suffixes like -si (dative), -mo (ablative), and -ya (allative), indicating the presence of case markers.
2. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that Warao has at least 4 cases: dative (DAT), locative (LOC), allative (ALL), and ablative (ABL).
3. **Paragraph 4** discusses the dative case in detail, with suffixes such as -si, -ta, and -ima.
4. **Paragraph 6** mentions that demonstrative pronouns inflect for cases like dative and ablative.
5. **Paragraph 12** provides examples of locative and allative cases.
6. **Paragraph 21** shows the use of locative and ablative markers in various contexts.
7. **Paragraph 32** discusses the comitative case expressed by the postposition kaika.
8. **Paragraph 40** mentions the agentive postposition aisia, used in passive constructions.

From these points, we can infer that Warao has a productive case system with at least the following cases:
- **Dative (DAT)**: -si, -ta, -ima
- **Locative (LOC)**: -te
- **Allative (ALL)**: -ya
- **Ablative (ABL)**: -mo
- **Comitative (COM)**: kaika
- **Agentive (AG)**: aisia

Given this information, Warao has a productive case system with at least 6 cases. 

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Wari',"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari' consistently indicate that there is no morphological case marking in the language. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Explicitly states, ""There is no case marking in the language.""
2. **Paragraph 2**: Reiterates, ""since there is no case marking, it does not govern case.""
3. **Paragraph 4**: Clearly mentions, ""There is no case marking in the language.""
4. **Paragraph 6**: Confirms, ""There is no double case marking in the language.""
5. **Paragraph 9**: States, ""Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause.""
6. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions, ""Aside from the marking discussed under 2.1.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.1.3, there are no other ways, other than in kinship terms (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), for directly marking noun functions on the noun.""

These repeated assertions across multiple sections of the grammar make it clear that Wari' does not employ morphological case marking for nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Yagua as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Discusses noun phrases coding A and S roles, marked by word order and cross-referencing with Set I and Set II clitics.
   - Genitives are mentioned, but there is no indication of a distinct genitive case marker; instead, possession is indicated by word order and clitics.

2. **Paragraph 2**:
   - Yagua is described as a postpositional language with numerous postpositions, including adlative, ablative, dative, and locative.
   - These postpositions are not integrated into a case system but function more like prepositions in English.

3. **Paragraph 6**:
   - Discusses the use of Set I and Set II clitics for subject and object reference, indicating a reliance on clitics rather than morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 10**:
   - Further elaborates on the use of Set I and Set II clitics for subject and object reference, reinforcing the idea that clitics are used instead of morphological case markers.

5. **Paragraph 17**:
   - Mentions that certain clitics are used for participant reference, but these are not described as morphological case markers.

6. **Paragraph 22**:
   - Discusses the structure of noun phrases and the use of classifiers, but does not mention morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 29**:
   - Describes the use of Set II clitics for object reference and the coreferential -yu clitic, but again, these are not morphological case markers.

8. **Paragraph 30**:
   - Discusses noun classifiers and their use in agreement with demonstratives and numerals, but does not mention morphological case marking.

9. **Paragraph 31**:
   - Describes the use of action nominalizations and their syntactic roles, but does not indicate the presence of morphological case marking.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Yagua does not exhibit a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order, clitics, and postpositions to indicate grammatical relations. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Yagua is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system of Hup as follows:

1. **Core Case Marking**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Hup has a nominative-accusative alignment system. Subjects are unmarked, while objects are marked with the suffix -a‡n, depending on animacy and definiteness. Oblique arguments are marked with the suffix -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and with -an for directional roles.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Reiterates that Hup employs morphological case marking with a nominative-accusative alignment.
   - **Paragraph 15**: Discusses the oblique case -Vêt, which is used for non-core participants in the clause, including locative, instrumental, and comitative roles.

2. **Differential Object Marking**:
   - **Paragraph 7**: Differential object marking is obligatory for human nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives, optional for animals, and ungrammatical for inanimates.

3. **Case Marking on Noun Phrases and Relative Clauses**:
   - **Paragraph 37**: Case marking in Hup is not limited to individual nominal words but also occurs on noun phrases and relative clauses, marking the phrase as a whole.

4. **Summary of Case Markers**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Summarizes the grammatical relations and case markers in Hup, indicating that nouns can take no more than a single case marker at a time.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Hup has a productive case-marking system with distinct markers for nominative (unmarked), accusative (-a‡n), and oblique (-Vêt, -an) roles. This system includes marking for core arguments (subjects and objects) and non-core arguments (obliques).

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",4 cases,4 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Huitoto (Murui) by analyzing the information about its case-marking system. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1 (315)**:
   - Murui has a nominative-accusative case marking system.
   - Core arguments (S/A and O) are subject to differential case marking.
   - Core arguments can also be marked for the locative/dative case.
   - There are five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.
   - Oblique cases do not co-occur with core cases in a single NP, except possibly the ablative.

2. **Paragraph 2 (316)**:
   - Table 6.3 lists the core and oblique cases:
     - Core cases: nominative (S/A), accusative (O), and dative/locative.
     - Oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

3. **Paragraph 5 (117)**:
   - Nouns distinguish the following grammatical categories: classifiers, number, and case.
   - Case marking is obligatory but subject to differential marking.

4. **Paragraph 12 (299)**:
   - Oblique cases mark any non-core arguments and their marking cannot be omitted.
   - Five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

5. **Paragraph 13 (5.1)**:
   - Genitive marking on pronouns is discussed, but it is not strictly a case as it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations.

### Conclusion:

From the information provided, we can conclude that Huitoto (Murui) has a total of 8 cases:
- **Core Cases**: nominative, accusative, and dative/locative.
- **Oblique Cases**: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

Thus, the total number of cases in Huitoto (Murui) is 8.

### Conclusion: 8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Iquito. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, such as word order, pronouns, tense, aspect, and derivational morphology, but they do not provide evidence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

Here is the reasoning for the chosen option:

1. **Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 17, 24, 34, 42, 44, and 45**: These paragraphs primarily discuss word order, pronouns, and sentence structure, including the placement of subjects, objects, and verbs. They do not mention any case markers for nouns.
   
2. **Paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50**: These paragraphs cover a range of topics including phonology, orthography, tense and aspect, derivational morphology, and discourse modes. None of these paragraphs provide information about morphological case-marking for nouns.

3. **General Observation**: The absence of any mention of case markers in the discussion of sentence structure and noun phrases suggests that Iquito does not use morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other grammatical devices to indicate grammatical relations.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, the following points are relevant to determine the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** explicitly states that ""Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no agreement indicating grammatical relations."" This indicates that Movima does not use morphological case marking to distinguish grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 4** mentions that ""Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is absent."" This confirms that the only form of case marking in Movima is the oblique case, which is used to mark non-core arguments.

3. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 6** further elaborate on the hierarchical alignment system and the use of oblique marking for certain arguments, but do not introduce any additional cases beyond the oblique case.

4. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 5** discuss various morphological features and incorporation processes but do not mention any additional cases.

5. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 10** provide background information and structural characteristics of Movima without introducing new case distinctions.

6. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 9** discuss the use of demonstratives and other referential elements but do not introduce any new cases.

### Conclusion:

Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, we can extract several key points related to case marking:

1. **Ergative Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions an ""ergative case-marking system that is conditioned by subordination environments.""
   - Paragraph 9 states that ""the ergative case marker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause.""

2. **Dative Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 discusses the dative case marking in traditional ditransitive predicates and noncanonical verb types.
   - Paragraph 7 mentions verbs that require a dative A, including verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear, and desire.

3. **Genitive Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 33 describe genitive constructions, indicating the use of a genitive postposition õ and relational prefixes.

4. **Instrumental and Locative Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 39 discuss the use of postpositions, including instrumental and locative, which are used to mark oblique arguments.
   - Paragraph 6 mentions noncanonical marking involving various postpositions, including locative, dative, instrumental, and ergative.

5. **Nonfinite Verb Forms and Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 12 highlight the use of nonfinite verb forms in subordination, which often involves ergative marking.

6. **Relational Prefixes**:
   - Paragraph 38 discusses relational prefixes as indicators of constituency between a head and a dependent element, which can be seen as a form of case marking.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Apinayé exhibits a productive case-marking system with at least the following cases:
- Ergative
- Dative
- Genitive
- Instrumental
- Locative

Given the presence of these distinct cases, the language can be classified as having 6-7 cases.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant sections:

1. **Case Marking Overview**:
   - Kakua has a nominative-accusative alignment system.
   - Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb (head-marking).
   - Object arguments receive case morphology marked on the NPs (dependent-marking).
   - Table 6.1 lists the case markers: 
     - Object (direct and indirect) =diʔ
     - Locative =bǔ
     - Instrumental/Comitative =hiʔ̃́
     - Terminative pɨ (preposition)

2. **Core Cases**:
   - The core cases include nominative (subject) and accusative (object).
   - The nominative case is not marked morphologically but is indicated through verb agreement.
   - The accusative case is marked with =diʔ.

3. **Other Cases**:
   - Locative case is marked with =bǔ.
   - Instrumental/Comitative case is marked with =hiʔ̃́.
   - Terminative case is marked with the preposition pɨ.

4. **Differential Object Marking (DOM)**:
   - Object marking is influenced by animacy and definiteness.
   - Human referents, proper names, and kinship terms are obligatorily marked when functioning as objects.

5. **Summary of Case Markers**:
   - The language has distinct markers for object, locative, instrumental/comitative, and terminative cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Kakua has a total of 4 distinct productive case markers for nouns:
1. Accusative (object) =diʔ
2. Locative =bǔ
3. Instrumental/Comitative =hiʔ̃́
4. Terminative pɨ

Thus, the number of cases in Kakua is **4 cases**.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking case relations include comitative, instrument, location, direction, and ablative. This indicates that Yuracare uses postpositions to mark case relations, specifically for peripheral relations.

2. **Paragraph 5** provides a list of postpositional markers: comitative (=tina), instrument (=la), locative (=y), direction (=chi), and ablative (=jsha). The author explicitly states that these markers are considered postpositions rather than case markers because they mark non-central participants, aligning with Payne’s continuum from case markers to adpositions.

3. **Paragraph 10** reiterates that grammatical relations in Yuracare are mainly marked through verbal cross-referencing, with dependent marking (postpositions) used mainly to mark peripheral participants. This supports the idea that the language relies on postpositions rather than a traditional case system.

4. **Paragraph 15** outlines the structure of the noun phrase, indicating that postpositional clitics are used to mark relationships within the noun phrase. This further supports the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.

5. **Paragraph 24** discusses the enclitic =ja, which is used for emphasis and not for marking grammatical relations. This indicates that the language does not use case markers for core grammatical relations but relies on other means such as postpositions and verbal cross-referencing.

6. **Paragraph 33** discusses number marking and mentions that plural is marked by the enclitic =w, which minimally appears on the last element of the NP. This indicates that number marking is separate from case marking and further supports the use of enclitics for marking peripheral relations.

7. **Paragraph 34** provides an overview of the noun phrase, indicating that number and postpositional clitics are used to mark relationships within the NP. This aligns with the previous information about the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.

8. **Paragraph 35** outlines the structure of the clause and mentions that word order and pragmatic status play a role in marking grammatical relations, further supporting the idea that Yuracare does not rely on a traditional case system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Yuracare uses postpositional enclitics to mark peripheral relations such as comitative, instrument, location, direction, and ablative. These markers are considered postpositions rather than inflectional case markers, and the language relies on verbal cross-referencing and word order to mark core grammatical relations. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Yuracare's case-marking system is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Camsá,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can identify several productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the analysis:

- **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by -ok for inanimate nouns and -bi-ok for animate nouns (e.g., ""yebunok"" for ""in the house"" and ""bobontsbioka"" for ""at the house of the young man"").
- **Genitive Case**: The genitive case is marked by -be, used for possession (e.g., ""ats̈-be"" for ""my"" and ""bobontsbe"" for ""young man’s"").
- **Benefactive Case**: The benefactive case is marked by -am for inanimate nouns and -bi-am for animate nouns (e.g., ""shknen-am"" for ""for the plate"" and ""bata-bi-am"" for ""for my aunt"").
- **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is marked by -ak, -k, or -ek depending on the noun ending (e.g., ""s̈knen-ak"" for ""with a plate"" and ""tamo-k"" for ""with salt"").
- **Comitative Case**: The comitative case is marked by -abtak for animate nouns (e.g., ""kes̈-abtak"" for ""with the dog"" and ""bata-btak"" for ""with my aunt"").
- **Allative Case**: The allative case is marked by -oy for inanimate nouns and -bi-oy for animate nouns (e.g., ""tjoy"" for ""to the mountain"" and ""batá-bi-oy"" for ""to my aunt"").
- **Ablative Case**: The ablative case is marked by -okan for inanimate nouns and -bi-okan for animate nouns (e.g., ""tj-okan"" for ""from the mountain"" and ""bata-bi-okan"" for ""from my aunt"").
- **Adessive Case**: The adessive case is marked by -ents̈ (e.g., ""taban-ents̈e"" for ""in the town"" and ""kanÿ-ents̈e"" for ""in one place"").
- **Illative Case**: The illative case is marked by -iñ (e.g., ""kwashaj-iñ"" for ""into the gourd"").

These cases are productive and are used to mark various grammatical relations in noun phrases. The presence of these multiple cases indicates that Camsá has a rich case system.

2. **Conclusion:**

Conclusion: 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kadiwéu, here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions nominative and accusative cases but indicates that the morpheme -d: is not a case marker but a semantic role marker.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Confirms the presence of nominative and accusative cases for subjects and objects, respectively.
3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses various semantic role markers such as dative, benefactive, adessive, etc., but these are identified as semantic role markers rather than traditional grammatical cases.
4. **Paragraph 8**: Lists several semantic role markers (theme, goal, dative, benefactive, allative, adessive) but again emphasizes their role in licensing grammatical arguments rather than functioning as traditional case markers.
5. **Paragraph 11**: States that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic case morphology.
6. **Paragraph 21**: Reiterates that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements that assign semantic roles, such as theme, dative, benefactive, goal, adessive, and allative.
7. **Paragraph 22**: Confirms that Kadiwéu has semantic role markers but does not have traditional case markers for nouns.
8. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses the role of semantic role markers in licensing grammatical arguments, further supporting the idea that these are not traditional case markers.

From the analysis, it is clear that Kadiwéu uses semantic role markers extensively, but these do not constitute a traditional case system for nouns. Instead, they function to assign semantic roles to pronominals and other elements.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Karajá by examining the relevant information about noun morphology and the use of postpositions.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Karajá lacks adjectives as an independent part of speech and uses genitive constructions instead. This implies that nouns can take possessive prefixes, but it does not directly indicate the presence of a case system.

2. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 15** provide a list of postpositions in Karajá, such as stationary locative (èkI), dynamic locative (ètSi), diffuse locative (èb´)), temporal (èku), ablative (èr´bI), instrumental (èdI), dative (èd´kE), allative (èkO), evitative (èlaku), comitative (èw´da)), and comparative (èw´TE). These postpositions indicate that Karajá uses a system of postpositions to mark various grammatical relations.

3. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 16** discuss the use of relational prefixes and the marking of possessive constructions, but they do not provide evidence of a productive case system for marking syntactic roles like nominative or accusative.

4. **Paragraph 30** and **Paragraph 37** describe the use of postpositions in forming adverbial clauses and purpose clauses, further indicating that Karajá relies on postpositions rather than a morphological case system.

5. **Paragraph 43** and **Paragraph 44** mention that core NP arguments (subject and direct object) are not morphologically marked, and pronominal subjects are expressed by free pronouns, while pronominal objects are expressed by bound morphemes.

6. **Paragraph 45** and **Paragraph 49** provide examples of deverbal nouns and the use of nominalizing suffixes, but they do not indicate a case system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Karajá does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it uses a system of postpositions to indicate various grammatical relations. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Karajá is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Baure,"1. **Reasoning:**

The language Baure does not exhibit a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, it relies heavily on head-marking strategies, where semantic roles are marked on the verb rather than on the noun. The only instance of case-like marking mentioned is the locative suffix -ye, which is used to indicate location. This locative marking can be considered an oblique case, but it is the only case-like marking present and does not extend to core grammatical relations. Additionally, the language employs various other morphological processes such as incorporation, compounding, and the use of classifiers, but these do not constitute a productive case system for nouns.

2. **Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
