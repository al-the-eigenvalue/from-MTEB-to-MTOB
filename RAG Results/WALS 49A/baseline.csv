1. **Research and Analysis**:
   - **Morphological Case-Marking**: We need to establish whether Seme uses morphological case-marking. This involves checking if nouns in Seme change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, possession).
   - **Number of Cases**: If Seme does use morphological case-marking, we need to identify the number of distinct cases. Common cases include nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, etc.
   - **Borderline Case-Marking**: We also need to consider if Seme uses exclusively borderline case-marking, where only peripheral or semantic relations like locatives or instrumentals are marked.

2. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the available typological data and linguistic descriptions of Seme, it is determined that Seme has **6-7 cases**. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that Seme employs distinct morphological markers for several grammatical roles, including nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative, among others.

Conclusion: 6-7 cases",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases

Arapesh (Mountain),"Mountain Arapesh, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, exhibits a system of case marking that is somewhat limited and does not align with the extensive case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian. The language primarily uses prepositions to indicate relationships between nouns rather than relying on a rich system of morphological case marking.

In Mountain Arapesh, there is evidence of some case marking, but it is not extensive. The language uses a limited set of morphological markers to indicate certain grammatical relationships, particularly for locative and instrumental cases. However, these markers are not part of a broad, productive case paradigm that applies to all nouns in the language.

Given the information available, Mountain Arapesh does not have a fully developed system of morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on a few markers for specific functions, which aligns more closely with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. Mountain Arapesh uses a limited set of morphological markers for specific cases such as locative and instrumental.
2. These markers are not part of a broad, productive case paradigm that applies to all nouns.
3. The language primarily uses prepositions to indicate relationships between nouns, rather than a rich system of morphological case marking.

In terms of case marking, Asmat does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. There are no overt case markers that systematically apply to nouns to indicate their syntactic roles such as subject, object, or indirect object.

Given this information, Asmat falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Batak (Karo),"The Karo Batak language, spoken by the Karo people in North Sumatra, Indonesia, does not utilize a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This characteristic aligns with the broader typological features of many Austronesian languages, which often lack extensive case marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Karo Batak does not exhibit morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated by their position in the sentence and the use of prepositions.
2. **Prepositional Usage**: Functions that might be marked by cases in other languages, such as locative or instrumental roles, are expressed through prepositions rather than inflectional morphology.
3. **Austronesian Language Family**: Many languages in the Austronesian family, to which Karo Batak belongs, do not have productive case systems. They often use other means, such as word order and prepositions, to convey grammatical relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. Chamorro primarily distinguishes between two cases: the absolutive and the ergative.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Absolutive Case:** This case is used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.
   - **Ergative Case:** This case is used for the subject of transitive verbs.

These two cases are used to mark the syntactic roles of nouns in sentences, which aligns with the ergative-absolutive alignment system. The presence of these two cases allows Chamorro to differentiate between the roles of nouns in different syntactic contexts.

Given this information, Chamorro does not have a more extensive case system that would include additional cases such as dative, genitive, or locative. Therefore, it fits into the category of having 2 cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",no morphological case-marking,2 cases
Daga,"Daga is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Daga is known for having a relatively simple case system. 

The language primarily uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate grammatical relationships. This means that instead of changing the form of the noun itself to show its role in the sentence, Daga typically uses separate words (postpositions) that follow the noun to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and possession.

Given this information, Daga does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the sense of inflectional morphology. Instead, it relies on syntactic means (postpositions) to convey these relationships.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"The Dani language, specifically the Lower Grand Valley Dani, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. In terms of case marking, Dani does not exhibit a complex system of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Simplicity**: Dani lacks the extensive inflectional morphology that characterizes languages with multiple cases. The language does not have a system of suffixes or prefixes that attach to nouns to indicate different grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: Instead of morphological case marking, Dani uses word order and context to convey grammatical relationships. This is a common feature in many Papuan languages, where syntactic means are preferred over morphological ones.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Dani grammar by linguists such as Karl J. Franklin and others do not indicate the presence of a productive case system. The focus is more on the use of particles and word order to manage syntactic roles.

Given these points, it is clear that Dani does not employ a system of morphological case marking for its nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking

Given this information, Hamtai does not have a complex system of morphological case-marking. It falls under the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Hua,"Hua, also known as Yagaria, is a Papuan language spoken in Papua New Guinea. In linguistic typology, Hua is known for its complex system of noun classification and verb morphology. However, when it comes to case marking, Hua does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do.

Instead, Hua relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. While there are some postpositions that can indicate locative or instrumental relations, these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of productive case paradigms.

Given this information, Hua does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Ilocano,"Ilocano, an Austronesian language spoken primarily in the Philippines, does not utilize a productive case system for marking nouns in the way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, it relies heavily on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. 

In Ilocano, the primary method for indicating relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence is through the use of particles and prepositions rather than inflectional morphology. For example, the particle ""ti"" is used to mark the nominative case (subject), while ""iti"" is used for the genitive or possessive case. However, these particles do not constitute a productive case paradigm in the traditional sense of inflectional morphology.

Given this information, Ilocano falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" as it does not have a system of inflectional case markers for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Instead, it relies more on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Imonda does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and possibly prepositions or postpositions, to convey the relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.
   - Given the definition of grammatical case and the specific criteria for counting cases, Imonda falls into the category of languages that do not use morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",5 cases,no morphological case-marking
Atayal,"Atayal is an Austronesian language spoken in Taiwan. Austronesian languages, particularly those in Taiwan, often exhibit a system of case-marking that is not as extensive as those found in languages with rich inflectional morphology like Latin or Russian. Instead, they typically have a more limited set of cases, often focusing on marking core grammatical relations such as nominative and genitive, and sometimes including locative or instrumental markers.

Atayal specifically has a case-marking system that distinguishes between nominative, genitive, and locative cases. These cases are used to mark the subject, possessor, and location respectively. This system does not extend to a large number of cases, but it does include more than just a nominative-accusative distinction.

Given this information, Atayal has a system that includes three distinct cases: nominative, genitive, and locative.

Conclusion: 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases

It belongs to the Central Solomon languages, which are part of the larger Papuan language family. Lavukaleve is known for its complex morphosyntactic structures, including its case-marking system.

In Lavukaleve, case-marking is used to indicate various grammatical relations, but it is not as extensive as in some other languages with highly developed case systems. The language primarily uses postpositions to mark grammatical relations, which can be considered a form of case-marking. However, these postpositions are more aligned with marking concrete or peripheral relations rather than core syntactic functions like nominative or accusative.

Given the nature of Lavukaleve's case-marking system, it fits the description of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This is because the language uses overt marking primarily for locative and instrumental relations, which are considered peripheral or semantic cases.

### Reasoning:
1. Lavukaleve employs postpositions to mark grammatical relations.

Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines, does not have a productive case system for nouns in the same way that many Indo-European languages do. Instead, Tagalog uses a system of markers to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns within sentences. These markers are often referred to as ""case markers,"" but they function differently from the inflectional case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian.

In Tagalog, there are three primary sets of markers that indicate the roles of nouns:

1. **Ang-markers**: These are used for the subject or topic of the sentence.
2. **Ng-markers**: These indicate the direct object or the genitive case.
3. **Sa-markers**: These are used for indirect objects, locations, and other oblique roles.

These markers are not inflectional endings attached to nouns but are separate words that precede the nouns they mark. Because these markers do not form a productive case paradigm in the traditional sense (where nouns themselves change form to indicate case), Tagalog does not fit neatly into the category of languages with morphological case-marking.

Given this system, Tagalog falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" as it does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Based on the available linguistic data, Una has the following cases:
1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Dative
5. Locative
6. Instrumental

These cases are used to mark subjects, direct objects, possessors, indirect objects, locations, and instruments, respectively. The presence of these six distinct cases indicates that Una has a relatively rich case system.

**Reasoning:**
- The nominative case marks the subject of a sentence.
- The accusative case marks the direct object.
- The genitive case marks possession.
- The dative case marks the indirect object.
- The locative case marks location.
- The instrumental case marks the means or instrument by which an action is performed.

Given that Una has six distinct and productive cases, it falls into the category of having ""6-7 cases.""

Usan,"Usan, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure compared to many other languages. In the context of grammatical case, Usan does not exhibit a complex system of case marking. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

In Usan, there is no extensive paradigm of morphological case marking for nouns. This means that nouns do not inflect for different cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, etc., which are common in languages with rich case systems. Instead, the language uses other strategies, such as prepositions or postpositions, to indicate relationships that might be marked by case in other languages.

Given this information, Usan falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it is known for its complex morphosyntactic alignment. However, Yimas does not use a traditional case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb agreement to indicate grammatical relations.

In Mian, there are two primary cases:

1. **Nominative**: This case is used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: This case is used for the direct object of a sentence.

These two cases are marked morphologically on nouns, which means that Mian employs a nominative-accusative alignment system. The language does not have additional productive case paradigms for other syntactic or semantic roles.

Given this information, Mian falls into the category of having ""2 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,2 cases
Inanwatan,"Inanwatan, a language spoken in Papua, Indonesia, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure. According to linguistic studies and typological surveys, Inanwatan does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Inanwatan lacks a productive case-marking system for nouns.
   - The language uses word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a set of morphological case markers that apply systematically to nouns in Inanwatan.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"Abui, a Papuan language spoken in Indonesia, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on concrete or peripheral relations such as locatives and instrumentals. This means that the language does not have a fully productive case system for marking core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive in a way that is typical of languages with a more extensive case system.

Instead, Abui uses overt marking for specific semantic roles, particularly those related to location and instrumentality. This type of marking is indicative of what is referred to as ""borderline case-marking."" In such systems, the case markers are not used to indicate syntactic roles like subject or object but are instead used for more concrete relations.

Given this information, Abui does not fit into the categories of having a specific number of cases (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) but rather fits into the category of exclusively borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awtuw,"Awtuw, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. In Awtuw, there are two primary cases: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. This binary distinction is typical of nominative-accusative languages, where the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs is marked the same way, and the direct object of transitive verbs is marked differently.

Given this information, Awtuw has a productive case paradigm of nouns that includes two cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",5 cases,2 cases
Mpur,"Mpur, also known as Amberbaken, is a language spoken in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the East Bird's Head language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Mpur, particularly its case system, it is important to note that Mpur does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships and roles within sentences.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Mpur does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns. This means that nouns in Mpur do not inflect for different cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
   - The language uses other syntactic strategies, such as word order and prepositions, to convey the relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
   - There is no evidence of a system where nouns are marked for multiple grammatical cases, nor is there a system of exclusively borderline case-marking for peripheral roles like locatives or instrumentals.

Given this information, the most accurate classification for Mpur in terms of its case system is ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Mehek in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abun,"Abun is a language spoken in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the West Papuan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Abun does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relations within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking:** Abun does not use morphological case markers to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns (such as subject, object, etc.). Instead, it employs other means such as word order and possibly prepositions or postpositions to convey these relationships.
   - **Typological Characteristics:** Many languages in the West Papuan family, including Abun, tend to lack extensive case-marking systems. They often use alternative strategies like word order or adpositions to indicate grammatical relations.
   - **Linguistic Descriptions:** Descriptions of Abun's grammar do not mention the presence of a productive case system. This absence is consistent with the typological profile of many languages in the region.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Koasati, also known as Coushatta, is a Muskogean language spoken by the Coushatta people in Louisiana and Texas. In terms of grammatical case, Koasati does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences. 

Koasati uses a combination of verb agreement and postpositions to convey relationships that might be marked by case in other languages. For instance, subject and object roles are typically indicated through verb morphology rather than noun inflection. Additionally, locative and other relational meanings are expressed through postpositions rather than case endings.

Given this information, Koasati falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Maricopa,"Maricopa is a Yuman language spoken by the Maricopa people in Arizona. In terms of its grammatical structure, Maricopa does not exhibit a rich system of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relations.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Maricopa primarily uses word order to indicate grammatical relations rather than a system of morphological case-marking.
   - There are no productive case paradigms for nouns in Maricopa that would align with the typical nominative, accusative, dative, or other such cases found in languages with morphological case systems.
   - The language does have some postpositions and other markers that can indicate certain relationships, but these do not constitute a productive case system as defined in the context of grammatical cases.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"The Southern Sierra Miwok language, part of the Miwok language family, exhibits a case-marking system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. In Southern Sierra Miwok, there is evidence of case marking primarily for distinguishing subject and object roles, but it does not extend to a wide range of grammatical relations.

Southern Sierra Miwok uses suffixes to mark cases, but the system is limited. The primary cases identified in Southern Sierra Miwok are:

1. **Nominative**: This case is used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: This case is used for the direct object of a sentence.

Given this information, Southern Sierra Miwok has a basic nominative-accusative case system, which means it has two productive cases.

### Reasoning:
- The language marks the subject (nominative) and the direct object (accusative) distinctly.
- There is no extensive system of cases beyond these two primary grammatical relations.
- Other roles such as locative, instrumental, etc., are not marked by a productive case system but may be indicated by other means such as adpositions or context.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",6-7 cases,2 cases
Nez Perce,"Nez Perce is a language that belongs to the Sahaptian family, spoken in the northwestern United States. It is known for its complex morphological structure, including its case system. In Nez Perce, nouns are marked for case to indicate their grammatical roles within a sentence. The primary cases in Nez Perce are:

1. **Nominative**: Used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: Used for the direct object of a sentence.
3. **Genitive**: Used to indicate possession.
4. **Dative**: Used for the indirect object.
5. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.

Given this information, Nez Perce has a productive case paradigm with five distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is a language belonging to the Iroquoian family, primarily spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. It is a polysynthetic language, which means it tends to form complex words with many morphemes that convey a lot of grammatical information. However, Oneida does not use morphological case-marking on nouns to indicate grammatical relations such as subject, object, or possession. Instead, grammatical relations are typically indicated through word order and verb morphology.

In Oneida, the roles of nouns in sentences are often clarified by the verb, which is highly inflected and can include information about the subject, object, and other participants in the action. This reliance on verb morphology rather than noun case-marking is characteristic of many polysynthetic languages.

Given this information, Oneida does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"Southeastern Pomo, a language of the Pomoan family spoken in Northern California, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

   - **Typological Characteristics:** This is consistent with the typological characteristics of Athabaskan languages, which generally do not have extensive case systems for nouns.
   - **Grammatical Relations:** In Slave, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically marked by verb prefixes and suffixes rather than by case markings on nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"The Squamish language, also known as Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, is a Coast Salish language spoken by the Squamish people in British Columbia, Canada. In terms of grammatical case, Squamish does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. This is characteristic of many Salishan languages, which typically do not use morphological case-marking.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Squamish does not have a system of inflectional case endings for nouns that indicate their grammatical roles (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).
   - Instead, grammatical relationships are primarily indicated through word order and the use of prepositions or particles.
   - This lack of morphological case-marking aligns with the typological characteristics of other Salishan languages.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Tunica,"Tunica is a language isolate that was historically spoken in the southeastern United States. It is known for its polysynthetic structure and complex verb morphology. However, when it comes to noun morphology, Tunica does not exhibit a productive case system. Instead, grammatical relations are primarily indicated through word order and verb morphology rather than through case marking on nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Case Paradigms:** Tunica does not have a system of morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies to indicate relationships between nouns and verbs.
   - **Polysynthetic Nature:** The language's polysynthetic nature means that much of the grammatical information is encoded in the verb rather than in the noun. This includes subject and object markers that are attached to the verb.
   - **Historical and Descriptive Accounts:** Descriptions of Tunica, such as those by Mary Haas, who extensively documented the language, do not mention a system of case marking for nouns. Instead, they focus on the rich verbal morphology and the use of particles and word order to convey grammatical relations.

Given these points, it is clear that Tunica does not utilize a productive case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Washo,"Washo, a Native American language spoken in the region around Lake Tahoe in the United States, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.

Instead, it relies on word order and verb morphology to convey these relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Wichita does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. 
   - The language uses other strategies, such as verb agreement and word order, to indicate grammatical relations.
   - There is no evidence of overt morphological marking for cases like nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive in Wichita.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Wintu is a Native American language of the Wintu people of Northern California. It belongs to the Wintuan family of languages. In Wintu, case marking is not as extensive as in some other languages, but it does exist. Wintu primarily uses suffixes to mark cases, and the system is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case systems.

Wintu has a nominative-accusative alignment, meaning it distinguishes between the subject of a transitive verb (accusative) and the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of a transitive verb (nominative). Additionally, Wintu has a genitive case to mark possession.

Based on this information, Wintu has a productive case paradigm that includes at least the nominative, accusative, and genitive cases. Therefore, it can be classified as having 3 cases.

Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Nahuatl, specifically the Tetelcingo variety, does not exhibit a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, Nahuatl relies heavily on prepositions and postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This is characteristic of many Mesoamerican languages, which often use relational nouns or adpositions rather than inflectional morphology to express grammatical relationships.

In Tetelcingo Nahuatl, noun phrases are typically marked for possession, but this does not constitute a case system as defined in the context of grammatical cases. The language uses possessive prefixes and suffixes to indicate possession, but these do not extend to a broader system of case marking for other grammatical functions such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

Given this information, Tetelcingo Nahuatl does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language known for its complex consonantal system and relatively simple vowel system. One of the notable features of Abkhaz is its lack of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead of using cases, Abkhaz relies heavily on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

In Abkhaz, the relationships that would typically be marked by cases in other languages are often indicated through the use of prepositions or postpositions, and the verb morphology plays a significant role in encoding grammatical relations. This means that Abkhaz does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Abkhaz in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"Eastern Armenian, a branch of the Armenian language, has a well-defined system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language exhibits a productive case paradigm that includes the following cases:

1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Dative
5. Ablative
6. Instrumental
7. Locative

Each of these cases serves a distinct grammatical function, marking the relationship of the noun to other elements in the sentence. The nominative case typically marks the subject of a sentence, the accusative marks the direct object, the genitive indicates possession, the dative marks the indirect object, the ablative indicates separation or source, the instrumental marks the means or instrument by which an action is performed, and the locative indicates location.

Given this information, Eastern Armenian has a total of 7 productive cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases
Basque,"Basque is known for its rich case system. It is an ergative-absolutive language, meaning it marks the subject of an intransitive verb the same way as the object of a transitive verb (absolutive case), and it marks the subject of a transitive verb differently (ergative case). Beyond these core cases, Basque also has a variety of other cases to mark different grammatical relations and functions.

The productive case paradigms in Basque include:
1. Absolutive
2. Ergative
3. Dative
4. Genitive
5. Instrumental
6. Comitative
7. Benefactive
8. Locative (with several sub-cases like inessive, allative, ablative, etc.)

Given this extensive system, Basque clearly has more than 10 cases.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Catalan, a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia, among other regions, does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. This is consistent with other Romance languages like Spanish, French, and Italian, which also lack a productive case system for nouns.

In Catalan, the roles that might be marked by cases in other languages are typically indicated by prepositions. For example:
- The subject of a sentence is indicated by word order (e.g., ""El nen menja"" - ""The boy eats"").
- The direct object is also indicated by word order and sometimes by the preposition ""a"" when referring to specific animate objects (e.g., ""Veig el nen"" - ""I see the boy"").
- Possession is indicated by the preposition ""de"" (e.g., ""El llibre de la nena"" - ""The girl's book"").

Given this reliance on prepositions and word order rather than morphological case marking, Catalan falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a West Germanic language spoken in the Netherlands, exhibits a relatively simple case system. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, similar to that of Old English and Old High German. However, in contemporary Western Frisian, the case system has largely eroded, and the language relies more on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Context:** Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system with nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases. However, this system has largely disappeared in modern usage.
   - **Modern Usage:** In contemporary Western Frisian, there is no productive case marking on nouns. Instead, grammatical relationships are primarily indicated through word order and prepositions.
   - **Comparison with English:** Similar to English, which has largely lost its inflected case system except for pronouns, modern Western Frisian does not use morphological case marking for nouns.

In Huitoto (Murui), the marking of grammatical relations is typically achieved through the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case endings. This means that the language does not have a productive system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would fit into the traditional categories of nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it relies on postpositional phrases to convey these relationships.

Given this information, Huitoto (Murui) does not have a productive case system in the sense of inflectional morphology. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Huitoto (Murui) is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Iquito,"Iquito is a language spoken in Peru, belonging to the Zaparoan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Iquito does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as word order and prepositions to indicate the relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. 

The absence of a productive case paradigm means that Iquito does not use inflectional morphemes attached to nouns to indicate grammatical roles such as subject, object, or indirect object. This characteristic aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Analysis**: Studies and descriptions of Iquito grammar indicate that the language does not employ a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, syntactic roles are typically indicated through word order and the use of prepositions or postpositions.
2. **Typological Classification**: In typological terms, languages without morphological case-marking often use alternative strategies such as fixed word order or adpositions to convey grammatical relationships. Iquito fits this typological profile.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Descriptive grammars and linguistic fieldwork on Iquito do not document a system of case inflections for nouns, further supporting the classification of the language as lacking morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Cacua,"Cacua, a language spoken by the Cacua people in Colombia, is part of the Tucanoan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Cacua does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical means such as word order and adpositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Linguistic Analysis:** Studies and descriptions of Cacua indicate that it does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. This means that nouns in Cacua do not change form to indicate their grammatical role (such as subject, object, etc.) within a sentence.
   - **Typological Characteristics:** Cacua, like many other languages in the Tucanoan family, uses strategies other than case-marking to convey grammatical relationships. These strategies include the use of word order and adpositions.
   - **Absence of Case Paradigms:** There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Cacua, meaning that nouns do not inflect for different cases. This aligns with the typological feature of ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Yuracare,"Yuracare, a language spoken in Bolivia, is known for its complex morphology. However, it does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, Yuracare relies on other grammatical mechanisms, such as word order and verbal affixes, to indicate syntactic roles and relationships within sentences.

In Yuracare, there are no distinct morphological case markers that apply to nouns to indicate their grammatical function (such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.). Instead, the language uses a combination of word order and verbal morphology to convey these relationships. This means that Yuracare does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns, fitting the description of ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: Yuracare does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. There are no distinct suffixes or prefixes that attach to nouns to indicate their grammatical roles.
2. **Alternative Mechanisms**: The language uses other strategies, such as word order and verbal affixes, to indicate syntactic relationships, which is common in languages without morphological case-marking.
3. **Typological Evidence**: Studies and descriptions of Yuracare, such as those by linguists who have worked on the language, consistently note the absence of a case system.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphological structure. However, when it comes to case marking, Kadiwéu does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages with extensive case systems (like Latin or Russian) do. Instead, Kadiwéu relies more on other grammatical mechanisms, such as word order and verb morphology, to indicate grammatical relations.

In Kadiwéu, there is no evidence of a system of morphological case-marking that applies broadly and productively to nouns. The language does not use inflectional endings on nouns to indicate roles such as subject, object, or indirect object. Instead, it uses other strategies, such as verb agreement and word order, to convey these grammatical relationships.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Kadiwéu in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Karajá,"Karajá is a language spoken by the Karajá people in Brazil. It belongs to the Macro-Jê language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Karajá, particularly its case system, it is important to note that Karajá does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do.

Instead, Karajá relies heavily on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships. While there may be some markers for specific semantic roles, such as locatives or instrumentals, these do not constitute a comprehensive case system. Therefore, Karajá does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Karajá in terms of case-marking is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"Baure is an Arawakan language spoken in Bolivia. In terms of its grammatical structure, Baure does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns.
