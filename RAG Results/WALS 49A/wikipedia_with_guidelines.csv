Dyirbal,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dyirbal, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about the case system.

1. **Paragraph 2** clearly states: ""There is a four-term case system for pronouns and a nine-term one for nouns, noun markers and adjectives."" This indicates that Dyirbal has a complex case system with nine cases for nouns, noun markers, and adjectives.

2. **Paragraph 4** lists the cases explicitly: ""The ablative case, and the stem-forming nominal affix 'out of - , from - ' have the same realisation: -yunu. ... Although the simple genitive cases in Dyirbal have some semantic similarities with genitive and dative cases set up for other languages (for example, Latin) there are significant differences. ... The locative case has, in addition to its central use as an indicator of position, the following uses: ...""

3. **Paragraph 22** provides a detailed table of case inflections for nouns and adjectives, confirming the presence of nine cases: nominative, ergative, instrumental, simple genitive, locative, general genitive, dative, allative, and ablative.

4. **Paragraph 15** discusses the dative and allative cases, noting that they are both realized by -gu but have different syntactic functions, further supporting the complexity and number of cases.

5. **Paragraph 23** mentions the presence of various stem-forming affixes and their interaction with case inflections, reinforcing the detailed case system.

6. **Paragraph 24** summarizes the nine cases and groups them into three categories: syntactic relations (nominative, ergative, instrumental, dative), genitives (simple and general), and motion-related cases (allative, locative, ablative).

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Dyirbal has a productive and complex case system with nine cases for nouns, noun markers, and adjectives.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases

The language uses these postpositions to mark various syntactic and semantic roles, including ergative, dative, locative, ablative, allative, perlative, comitative, and deprivative. Therefore, the number of cases in Gooniyandi falls into the category of ""10 or more cases.""

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayardild,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Kayardild, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Case Concord and Multiple Case Marking**:
   - Kayardild exhibits ""unbounded concord"" where all cases percolate downwards to subconstituents until the unit ""word"" is reached, resulting in multiple case suffixes (Paragraph 4).
   - The language allows for extensive multiple inflection, with sequences of up to four case-like inflections (Paragraph 49).

2. **Types of Cases**:
   - The language has a rich set of case functions, including nominative, locative, ablative, proprietive, oblique, allative, genitive, instrumental, associative, origin, privative, consequential, utilitive, and verbal cases (Paragraphs 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48).
   - The verbal cases include verbal ablative, verbal allative, verbal dative, verbal donative, verbal evitative, verbal purposive, and verbal translative (Paragraph 24).

3. **Case Functions**:
   - Cases are used for various functions such as marking subjects, objects, instruments, locations, goals, sources, possession, and more (Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).

4. **Productivity and Integration**:
   - The verbal cases are fully integrated into the Kayardild case system and are productive (Paragraph 24).
   - The language has a tightly organized and rich system of case marking, typical of Pama-Nyungan languages (Paragraph 9).

5. **Examples of Case Usage**:
   - Examples provided in the text illustrate the use of multiple cases in a single phrase, such as the use of nominative, instrumental, modal ablative, and complementizing oblique (Paragraph 27).

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed descriptions and examples provided, it is clear that Kayardild has a very rich and complex case system with a large number of productive cases. The language exhibits extensive use of multiple case marking and has a wide variety of cases that cover a broad range of syntactic and semantic functions.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Malakmalak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malakmalak, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 41** lists several suffixes that can be attached to nouns, including:
   - Possessor suffix
   - Benefactive suffix
   - Intentive suffix
   - Relator suffix
   - Comitative suffix
   - Locative suffix
   - Agentive suffix
   - Proprietive affix
   - Resemblance suffix
   - Quantifying suffix
   - Dubitative suffix

2. **Paragraph 26** mentions the agentive marker ""-waQ"" which can be attached to a free subject NP.

3. **Paragraph 48** describes the functions of the suffix ""-no,"" which includes complement-marker, benefactive, possessor, and relator.

From the information provided, it is clear that Malakmalak has a productive system of case marking on nouns. The listed suffixes indicate that the language marks several grammatical and semantic relationships, such as possession, benefaction, location, and agency.

Given the number of distinct suffixes and their functions, it is reasonable to conclude that Malakmalak has a relatively large inventory of cases. Specifically, the language appears to have at least six to seven distinct cases, possibly more, depending on the exact nature and productivity of each suffix.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of multiple suffixes that mark different grammatical and semantic relations (e.g., locative, agentive, comitative) indicates a robust case system.
- The explicit mention of various suffixes and their functions supports the classification of Malakmalak as having a significant number of cases.

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mangarrayi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mangarrayi, the language exhibits the following case distinctions:

1. **Nominative**: Used for intransitive subjects and transitive subjects in masculine and feminine nouns.
2. **Accusative**: Used for direct objects in masculine and feminine nouns.
3. **Ergative**: Used for transitive subjects in neuter nouns.
4. **Absolutive**: Used for intransitive subjects and direct objects in neuter nouns.
5. **Genitive**: Used to express possession.
6. **Dative/Purposive**: Used to mark beneficiaries, indirect objects, and purposive meanings.
7. **Instrumental**: Used to express the means by which an action is performed.
8. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.
9. **Allative**: Used to indicate motion towards.
10. **Ablative**: Used to indicate motion away from or source.

The paragraphs indicate that Mangarrayi has a productive case system with distinct morphological markers for these functions. The presence of these multiple cases, including core syntactic cases (nominative, accusative, ergative, absolutive) and peripheral cases (genitive, dative/purposive, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative), suggests a rich inflectional system.

**Reasoning**:
- The language has distinct markers for core syntactic roles (nominative, accusative, ergative, absolutive).
- It also has markers for peripheral roles (genitive, dative/purposive, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative).
- The genitive, dative/purposive, and instrumental cases are used in specific syntactic and semantic contexts, indicating their productivity.
- The locative, allative, and ablative cases are used to express spatial relations, which are typical of languages with a rich case system.

**Conclusion**: 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Maranungku,"To determine the number of cases in Maranungku, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses class markers preceding nouns but does not mention case marking.
2. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions the benefactive case, which changes form depending on whether the beneficiary is a noun or pronoun.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Provides an example of sentence structure involving indirect objects but does not explicitly mention case marking.
4. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses the positioning of indirect objects but does not provide explicit case marking information.
5. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions the privative phrase marked by ""nangara"" following the noun, similar to the benefactive.
6. **Paragraph 14**: Provides examples of benefactive forms following the affix unit and verb stem.
7. **Paragraph 24**: Mentions accompaniment expressed by a noun followed by the marker ""witya.""
8. **Paragraph 29**: Discusses the instrument or agent phrase marked by ""nunu"" following the noun.
9. **Paragraph 33**: Mentions cause expressed by a noun followed by ""yanganafpom.""

From the information provided, we can identify several markers that function similarly to cases:

- **Benefactive**: Marked by ""nala"" for nouns and specific forms for pronouns.
- **Privative**: Marked by ""nangara.""
- **Accompaniment**: Marked by ""witya.""
- **Instrument/Agent**: Marked by ""nunu.""
- **Cause**: Marked by ""yanganafpom.""

These markers indicate that Maranungku has a system of marking nouns for specific semantic roles, which aligns with the concept of case marking. However, the markers identified are primarily for peripheral or concrete relations (benefactive, privative, accompaniment, instrument, and cause), and there is no evidence of core syntactic cases like nominative, accusative, or genitive.

Given this information, Maranungku appears to have overt marking only for concrete case relations, which fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Reasoning**: The language has markers for specific semantic roles but lacks evidence of a full-fledged case system with core syntactic cases. The markers identified are for peripheral roles, which aligns with the ""Exclusively borderline case-marking"" category.

**Conclusion**: Exclusively borderline case-marking.",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tiwi,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Nominal Morphology (Paragraph 1):**
   - ""Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi.""
   - This statement directly indicates that Tiwi does not use morphological case-marking for its nouns.

2. **Pronouns (Paragraph 11):**
   - The pronouns are used without inflexion in syntactic positions such as subject intransitive, subject transitive, object, and possessor.
   - This further supports the absence of case-marking as pronouns do not change form based on their syntactic role.

3. **Syntax (Paragraph 6):**
   - ""Tiwi, however (like many other Australian languages), has neither case inflexion nor fixed word order, and yet manages to avoid structural ambiguity.""
   - This reinforces the absence of case-marking and highlights that Tiwi relies on other means (such as word order and context) to convey grammatical relationships.

4. **Possessor Orientation (Paragraph 8):**
   - The process for indicating possession involves juxtaposition without any case inflexion or other overt mark of their relationship.
   - This indicates that even possessive relationships are not marked by case.

5. **General Observations (Paragraph 3):**
   - The description of word classes and their functions does not mention any case-marking.
   - The explanation of how structural relations are expressed without case inflexion further supports the absence of morphological case-marking.

Given these points, it is clear that Tiwi does not employ morphological case-marking for its nouns. The language uses other strategies such as word order, context, and specific syntactic constructions to convey grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Ungarinjin,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ungarinjin, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that Coate and Oates were under the impression that there were two distinct cases marked by ""ra,"" a locative and an instrumental agentive, the latter occurring only on pronouns and proper nouns.
2. **Paragraph 4** states that nominal postpositions in Ungarinjin do not normally indicate grammatical case relations, and noun phrases cross-referenced on the verb do not ordinarily bear case postpositions.
3. **Paragraph 9** discusses the locative usage and mentions that locative clauses often occur without case postpositions in positions where a noun phrase would demand one.
4. **Paragraph 11** indicates the use of a genitive postposition that sometimes serves a local function, similar to an ablative-elative counterpart to a lative.
5. **Paragraph 15** mentions a postposition ""-gu"" that serves some functions associated with the dative case in some Indo-European languages.
6. **Paragraph 17** distinguishes between grammatical and non-grammatical cases, stating that grammatical case relations are signaled only by cross-reference on the verb, while non-grammatical cases are signaled mainly by nominal postpositions.

From these points, it is clear that Ungarinjin primarily uses postpositions to indicate non-grammatical (semantic) relations such as locative, instrumental, and dative. The grammatical relations are marked by cross-referencing on the verb rather than by case postpositions on the noun. This suggests that the language does not have a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations on nouns.

**Reasoning:**
Ungarinjin uses postpositions for marking locative, instrumental, and dative relations, which are considered peripheral or semantic cases. The core grammatical relations are marked by cross-referencing on the verb, not by morphological case marking on the nouns. Therefore, the language does not have a productive case system for core grammatical relations but does mark some peripheral relations.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.**",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wambaya,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the case-marking system described for nominals.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Wambaya has an ergative-absolutive system for nominals and a nominative-accusative system for free pronouns. It also mentions an oblique form used in the dative case and as a base for other case forms.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides examples of case suffixes for different cases, including nominative, accusative, ergative/locative, dative, allative, ablative, comitative, perlative, and causal. This suggests a rich case system.
3. **Paragraph 3** confirms the presence of a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative, and accusative.
4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the genitive suffix and its use, along with other suffixes like proprietive, privative, and origin, which are different from the case suffixes.
5. **Paragraph 6** lists the Wambaya case suffixes in detail, including nominative, accusative, ergative/locative, dative, allative, ablative, comitative, perlative, and causal.
6. **Paragraph 10** mentions the use of the locative case and the comitative case.
7. **Paragraph 12** discusses the ergative/locative/instrumental case, indicating that one case covers multiple functions.
8. **Paragraph 16** mentions the dative case and its various functions.
9. **Paragraph 19** discusses the ablative case and its use in prior clauses.
10. **Paragraph 26** mentions the comitative case and its allomorphs.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive case paradigms for nouns in Wambaya:

1. **Nominative**: Used for subjects in intransitive and some transitive clauses.
2. **Accusative**: Used for direct objects.
3. **Ergative/Locative/Instrumental**: A single case suffix that covers ergative (agent of transitive verbs), locative (location), and instrumental (means by which an action is performed).
4. **Dative**: Used for indirect objects, possession, purpose, beneficiary, and other oblique functions.
5. **Allative**: Indicates direction towards an object or destination.
6. **Ablative**: Indicates direction away from a location or object.
7. **Comitative**: Expresses accompaniment.
8. **Perlative**: Indicates movement through or along.
9. **Causal**: Indicates cause or reason.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided, Wambaya has a productive case system with **10 or more cases**.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Amharic,"1. **Reasoning:**
Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amharic, there is evidence of case-marking in the language. Specifically, Paragraph 16 mentions the use of the marker -n for the direct object, and Paragraph 18 provides examples of the direct object marker -n being used with adjectives and nouns. Additionally, Paragraph 28 discusses the use of object suffix pronouns in relative clauses, indicating a system of marking dependent nouns for their grammatical relationships. However, there is no mention of a wide range of cases beyond the direct object marker and possessive constructions.

Given this information, it appears that Amharic has a limited case system primarily involving direct object marking and possessive constructions, rather than a fully developed case system with multiple distinct cases.

2. **Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Beja,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Beja, the language distinguishes between two cases: nominative and accusative. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""Two cases are distinguished in the noun-phrase: nominative and accusative,"" and further explains their functions and formal distinctions.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** do not provide additional information about the number of cases but rather discuss other grammatical aspects such as possessive constructions and vowel qualities.
3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** elaborate on noun-phrase structures and modifiers, but they do not introduce any additional cases beyond nominative and accusative.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** discuss verb forms and sentence structures, again without introducing new cases.
5. **Paragraph 8** and **Paragraph 9** focus on pronoun suffixes and other morphological details, reiterating the use of nominative and accusative forms.
6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** provide further details on noun and adjective stems, gender distinctions, and plural markers, but do not introduce new cases.
7. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** discuss temporal suffixes and derivational forms, without adding to the number of cases.
8. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss auxiliary verbs and sentence types, maintaining the focus on nominative and accusative cases.
9. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** discuss extended verbs and verb morphology, without introducing new cases.
10. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss intensification and derivation of verbs, again without adding new cases.

12. **Paragraph 22** and **Paragraph 23** discuss number distinctions and verb paradigms, without introducing new cases.
13. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** discuss syllable structure and consonants, without adding new cases.
14. **Paragraph 26** and **Paragraph 27** discuss temporal suffixes and predicative constructions, maintaining the focus on the two cases.
15. **Paragraph 28** and **Paragraph 29** discuss verb forms and derivation, without introducing new cases.
16. **Paragraph 30** and **Paragraph 31** discuss negative forms and strong stems, maintaining the focus on the two cases.
17. **Paragraph 32** and **Paragraph 33** discuss verb paradigms and concordial forms, without adding new cases.
18. **Paragraph 34** and **Paragraph 35** discuss optative forms and object pronoun suffixes, maintaining the focus on the two cases.
19. **Paragraph 36** and **Paragraph 37** discuss negative forms and derivation, without introducing new cases.
20. **Paragraph 38** and **Paragraph 39** discuss verb paradigms and preterite forms, maintaining the focus on the two cases.

22. **Paragraph 42** and **Paragraph 43** discuss object suffixes and other morphological details, maintaining the focus on the two cases.
23. **Paragraph 44** and **Paragraph 45** discuss present forms and negative concordial forms, without introducing new cases.

**Conclusion:** 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Berber (Middle Atlas),"Based on the provided paragraphs, it appears that Middle Atlas Berber (Tamazight) does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various morphological and syntactic features of the language, including the concept of ""state"" marking, which affects the form of nouns depending on their syntactic environment. However, this ""state"" marking does not correspond to a traditional case system that marks grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

The concept of ""state"" marking in Berber, which includes forms like the ""construct state"" and the ""free state,"" is more about the noun's syntactic position rather than marking specific grammatical relations. This is different from a productive case system where distinct morphological markers indicate specific syntactic or semantic roles of nouns within a sentence.

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion based on the provided information is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking
Diola-Fogny,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Diola-Fogny, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that noun phrases can function as genitives, infinitive complements, and in concept juxtaposition. It also describes possessive phrases and the use of bound possessive suffixes, but there is no mention of distinct morphological case markers for core syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, or dative.

2. **Paragraph 3** describes the use of relative pronouns and genitive particles, indicating that possession and relative clauses are marked, but again, there is no indication of a broader case system marking core grammatical relations.

3. **Paragraph 7** discusses genitive phrases and possessive phrases, indicating the use of genitive particles and bound possessive markers. However, these are not indicative of a full-fledged case system but rather specific markers for possession.

4. **Paragraph 8** explains the concord system in Diola-Fogny, where concord morphemes are used extensively. This suggests that agreement and relational markers are more prominent than a case system.

5. **Paragraph 9** elaborates on the concord system further, indicating that concord morphemes are used to maintain agreement within noun phrases and with verbs, but there is no mention of distinct morphological case markers for different syntactic roles.

6. **Paragraph 10** describes noun class markers and possessive suffixes, indicating a system of noun classification and possession marking rather than a case system.

Gimira,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gimira, the following observations can be made regarding the case system:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that case is marked by suffixes added to the final element of the noun phrase or penultimate element when a final quantifier is present.
2. **Paragraph 2** describes an ""oblique case form"" which functions as an object, possessive pronoun, and in adverbial cases. It also mentions three forms of subject pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 4** lists suffixes that may replace the nominative or accusative case marker or may be added to the locative or ablative suffix.
4. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of noun phrases with case suffixes, such as nominative, accusative, and locative.
5. **Paragraph 12** states that when the head of the phrase is a pronoun, the subject almost always bears the nominative suffix, and the object bears the accusative suffix when it is especially prominent.
6. **Paragraph 13** indicates that nominative and accusative suffixes are obligatory for specific nouns.
7. **Paragraph 23** provides examples of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative/benefactive, locative, and ablative cases.
8. **Paragraph 24** mentions that a locative or nominative case marker may also be affixed to the determiner.
9. **Paragraph 29** discusses the reflexive pronoun and its extended use beyond normal reflexive pronouns.

From these observations, it is clear that Gimira has a productive case system with at least the following cases:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Genitive
- Dative/Benefactive
- Locative
- Ablative

This indicates that Gimira has a case system with six or more cases. Given the explicit mention of these six cases and the possibility of additional cases not explicitly mentioned in the provided paragraphs, the most appropriate classification is ""6-7 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Grebo,"### Reasoning:

To determine the number of cases in Grebo, we need to look for evidence of productive case paradigms of nouns. This involves identifying any morphological markers that indicate different grammatical relationships such as nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, etc.

From the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that there is no significant difference in meaning between phrases with pre-nominal verbal adjectives and post-nominal adjectives, but this does not provide any evidence of case marking.

2. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss various grammatical structures, including relative pronouns and their tones, but again, there is no mention of morphological case marking.

3. **Paragraph 6** describes the use of particles like ""ne"" and ""no"" in different syntactic positions, but these particles do not function as case markers.

4. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss tone marking and stress patterns, which are important for understanding the phonology of Grebo but do not indicate morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss verb tense suffixes and plural forms of nouns, but there is no mention of case marking.

6. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 13** describe the tone of verbal affixes and the use of verbal nouns, but again, there is no evidence of case marking.

7. **Paragraph 14** and **Paragraph 15** discuss commands and nominal sentences, but do not provide information on case marking.

8. **Paragraph 16** and **Paragraph 17** describe nominal suffix units and their alternants, but these are related to plurality and derivation rather than case marking.

9. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** discuss verb forms and their tones, but do not mention case marking.

10. **Paragraph 20** and **Paragraph 21** describe suffix units and complex sentences, but do not provide evidence of case marking.

11. **Paragraph 22** and **Paragraph 23** discuss subjunctive mood and statements, but do not indicate case marking.

12. **Paragraph 24** and **Paragraph 25** describe postpositions and possessive pronouns, which are important for understanding syntactic relationships but do not function as case markers.

13. **Paragraph 26** and **Paragraph 27** discuss consonant clusters and translations of texts, but do not provide information on case marking.

14. **Paragraph 28** and **Paragraph 29** describe the origin of the Grebo people and notes on specific texts, but do not indicate case marking.

23. **Paragraph 46** and **Paragraph 47** describe noun-postposition phrases and adverb-noun phrases, but do not provide evidence of case marking.

24. **Paragraph 48** and **Paragraph 49** describe negative conjugation and relative clauses, but do not indicate case marking.

25. **Paragraph 50** describes nouns derived from verbs, but does not provide evidence of case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no evidence of productive morphological case marking in Grebo. The language appears to rely on other syntactic and morphological strategies, such as word order, particles, and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, the following points are relevant to determining the presence and number of productive case paradigms of nouns:

1. **Paragraph 2**: The text mentions that the category of case is present in Igbo grammar but is expressed through tonal relationships rather than morphological case marking. This suggests that case relations are not marked by inflectional suffixes on nouns but rather by tone and word order.

2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph describes genitival relationships in Igbo, where the relationship between nouns is indicated by tone rather than morphological case marking. Both nouns in a genitival relationship take non-inherent tones, but there is no mention of specific case suffixes.

3. **Paragraph 8**: It reiterates that grammatical relations in Igbo are expressed by word order and tone, not by morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph further emphasizes that tone is used to express grammatical relationships, including genitival relationships, rather than morphological case marking.

5. **Paragraph 19**: It discusses the expression of grammatical relations such as subject, object, and genitive through word order and tone, without mentioning any morphological case markers.

6. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph highlights that subject and object relationships are expressed tonally and through word order, not by morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 35**: It confirms that grammatical relations are expressed by tone and word order, with no mention of morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 47**: It provides examples of grammatical relationships of nouns, including genitive, subject, object, and post-prepositional, all expressed through tone and word order rather than morphological case marking.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Igbo does not use morphological case marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on tone and word order to express grammatical relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iraqw, we can identify the following case markers:

1. **Construct Case Suffix**: This is used when a noun is modified by another noun, an adjective, or a relative clause. It is also used when the noun phrase is followed by adverbial case clitics.
2. **Adverbial Case Suffixes**: These include:
   - **Directive Case Suffix**: Indicates direction towards something.
   - **Ablative Case Suffix**: Indicates direction away from something.
   - **Instrumental Case Suffix**: Indicates the means by which an action is performed.
   - **Reason Case Suffix**: Indicates the reason for an action.
3. **Background Case Suffix**: Used for noun phrases that are to be taken as a unit.
4. **Vocative Case**: Indicated by a high tone on the penultimate syllable.

The presence of these case markers indicates that Iraqw has a system of morphological case-marking. Specifically, the language has productive case paradigms for nouns that include at least the following cases:
- Construct
- Directive
- Ablative
- Instrumental
- Reason
- Background
- Vocative

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Iraqw has **6-7 cases**.",exclusively borderline case-marking,6-7 cases
Kinyarwanda,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kinyarwanda, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The paragraphs mention various syntactic constructions, verb forms, and some locative and instrumental uses, but they do not indicate a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would fit the definition of grammatical case as outlined.

Here is the reasoning for the chosen option:

1. **No mention of nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive cases**: The paragraphs do not describe any morphological markers that distinguish between subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, or possessors in a way that would suggest a case system.
2. **Locative and instrumental markers**: There are mentions of locative and instrumental uses (e.g., ""kuku"" for 'on', 'at', 'to', 'from'), but these are not part of a broader case system and seem to function more like adpositions or locative constructions rather than true cases.
3. **Verb-focused morphology**: The examples provided focus heavily on verb morphology and the roles of subjects and objects in relation to verbs, but they do not indicate that nouns themselves are inflected for case.
4. **Absence of a case paradigm**: There is no evidence of a systematic inflectional paradigm for nouns that would indicate multiple cases.

Given these points, the most appropriate conclusion is that Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Lango,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lango, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states: ""Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (ä la Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles. Word order, which is fairly rigid, is the primary device used to indicate grammatical roles in simple sentences.""

2. **Paragraph 6** reiterates: ""Nouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord class.""

3. **Paragraph 5** discusses existential, locative, and possessive constructions but does not mention any case marking on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 12** describe the organization of the noun phrase and associative constructions, respectively, without indicating any case marking.

5. **Paragraph 7** and **Paragraph 8** discuss various morphological and syntactic features but do not mention any productive case paradigms.

6. **Paragraph 10** and **Paragraph 11** discuss additional morphological and syntactic features, including agent nouns and personal names, but again, no mention of case marking.

7. **Paragraph 4** discusses the grammatical status of parataxis and serialization, which are syntactic constructions, not morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 9** discusses relative clauses and embedded cleft and topic constructions, focusing on syntactic roles rather than morphological case marking.

### Conclusion

Based on the evidence from the provided paragraphs, Lango does not exhibit morphological case marking on nouns. The primary device for indicating grammatical roles is word order, and there are no particles or affixes used to mark case. Therefore, the appropriate classification for Lango is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Murle,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Murle, the following information is relevant for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions ""Accusative Case,"" ""Nominative Case,"" and ""Genitive Case.""
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses a ""dative case"" used for indirect objects.
3. **Paragraph 3** refers to the ""accusative case"" and mentions a ""locative/instrumental context.""
4. **Paragraph 4** mentions ""accusative"" and ""nominative"" cases.
5. **Paragraph 5** discusses ""nominative"" and ""accusative"" cases.
6. **Paragraph 6** mentions ""locative/instrumental case.""
7. **Paragraph 11** lists ""accusative, locative/instrumental"" and mentions ""four plural case endings.""
8. **Paragraph 12** discusses the locative case and its context-dependent meanings.
9. **Paragraph 29** lists ""Genitive, acc, nom, fen, loc/ins"" as case markers.
10. **Paragraph 49** mentions ""nominative"" and ""accusative"" cases.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Murle:
- **Nominative Case**: Used for the subject of a clause.
- **Accusative Case**: Used for the direct object of a clause.
- **Genitive Case**: Used to indicate possession.
- **Dative Case**: Used for the indirect object of a clause.
- **Locative/Instrumental Case**: Used to indicate location or instrument.

This gives us a total of five distinct cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative/instrumental.

**Reasoning**: The descriptive grammar mentions five distinct cases that are used productively in the language. These cases are used to mark different grammatical functions and relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion**: 5 cases",4 cases,5 cases
Nama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nama, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the subordinative suffix -@, which is used to mark noun phrases of subordinate status. It mentions that if Nama is considered a ""case"" language, it would have two cases: an unmarked case and a marked case with the subordinative -@ suffix. Additionally, there are remnants of an agentive case marked by -i in certain fixed expressions. However, the analysis suggests that describing Nama as having a case system would be unnecessarily complex since there is only one grammatically productive morpheme involved.

Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case-marking in the language:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions the use of postpositions and nominal modifiers, indicating that relational functions are often expressed through postpositional phrases rather than inflectional case marking on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 8** describes the use of postpositions like ""bhéyi"" and ""ti"" to express relational meanings such as ""like"" and ""with,"" which are typically handled by cases in languages with morphological case systems. This suggests that Ngiti uses postpositions instead of morphological case markers.

3. **Paragraph 17** discusses the use of postpositions derived from inalienable nouns, which further supports the idea that relational meanings are expressed through postpositions rather than inflectional case marking.

4. **Paragraph 46** provides examples of compound postpositions and their modification by possessive pronouns, reinforcing the use of postpositional phrases for expressing relational meanings.

5. **Paragraph 47** mentions the use of the noun ""idza"" both as a noun and a locative modifier, indicating that locative meanings are expressed through nominal modifiers rather than inflectional case marking.

6. **Paragraph 33** describes the use of postpositions with pronominal modifiers, further indicating that relational meanings are expressed through postpositions rather than inflectional case marking.

7. **Paragraph 43** discusses particles and conjunctions, which are used for clause-level modifications and do not indicate the presence of morphological case marking on nouns.

8. **Paragraph 42** describes the derivation of nouns from verbs, but does not mention any inflectional case marking on these derived nouns.

9. **Paragraph 41** provides examples of possessive pronouns used for alienable possession, but does not indicate the presence of inflectional case marking on nouns.

10. **Paragraph 40** discusses the classification of Lendu and Ngiti as separate languages, but does not provide information on case marking.

11. **Paragraph 39** mentions the application of diphthongization rules, which are phonological processes and do not indicate the presence of inflectional case marking.

12. **Paragraph 38** describes the vowel harmony system in quadrisyllabic nouns, but does not mention any inflectional case marking.

13. **Paragraph 37** discusses diminutive derivations in verbs, which are morphological processes but do not indicate the presence of inflectional case marking on nouns.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Jamsay,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, Jamsay does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on postpositions to indicate relationships such as dative, locative, and instrumental. The language uses postpositions like ""le$"" for various grammatical functions, including locative, instrumental, and dative, rather than employing morphological case markers directly on nouns. This is evident from the descriptions in Paragraphs 1, 4, 8, and 16, where postpositions are used to express these relationships. Additionally, the language does not show evidence of a systematic case paradigm with multiple distinct morphological cases applied to nouns.

2. **Conclusion:**

Emai,"### Reasoning:

1. **Personal Pronouns and Case Marking:**
   - The language Emai has personal pronouns that reflect case distinctions, including nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. This is evident from the detailed tables and examples provided in the descriptive grammar. For instance, the nominative pronouns are ""i"" (1st person singular), ""u"" (2nd person singular), and ""o"" (3rd person singular), while the accusative pronouns are ""mè"" (1st person singular), ""é"" (2nd person singular), and ""óì"" (3rd person singular).

2. **Genitive Case:**
   - Genitive pronouns are also mentioned, such as ""ámáí"" (1st person singular), ""àvbá"" (2nd person singular), and ""ìyáín"" (3rd person singular). This indicates a productive genitive case system.

3. **Applicative and Benefactive Marking:**
   - The language uses applicative markers (li/ni) to indicate recipients and beneficiaries, which is a form of argument marking that could be considered a type of case marking.

4. **Absence of Extensive Case Paradigms for Nouns:**
   - Despite the presence of case distinctions in pronouns, there is no extensive evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns themselves. The examples provided focus on pronouns and do not extend to a wide range of noun case inflections.

5. **Use of Prepositions and Postpositions:**
   - The language relies on prepositions and postpositions to indicate various grammatical relations, such as location and direction, rather than inflecting nouns for these relations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided, Emai does not have a fully productive case system for nouns but does exhibit case distinctions in pronouns. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for Emai is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking.**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns that fits the traditional definition of grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, the language seems to rely heavily on word order, pronominal subjects, and postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses possession using a determiner and a possessive construction but does not indicate a case system.
2. **Paragraph 7**: Mentions pronominal subjects and adjoined subjects but does not indicate a case system.
3. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the syntax of possessive and locational postpositions, indicating that possession and location are marked by postpositions rather than cases.
4. **Paragraph 26**: Differentiates between grammatical and possessive uses of ""ni,"" suggesting a postpositional strategy rather than a case system.
5. **Paragraph 27**: Shows possessive constructions using ""a"" as a postposition, again indicating a postpositional strategy.
6. **Paragraph 30**: Discusses the use of ""na"" as a determiner in subordinate clauses, but this does not indicate a case system.
7. **Paragraph 39**: Provides cultural and linguistic background but does not discuss a case system.

Given the reliance on postpositions and the absence of clear morphological case markers for syntactic roles, it is reasonable to conclude that Ma'di does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Reasoning**: The language uses postpositions and pronominal subjects to indicate relationships between nouns and other sentence elements rather than a system of morphological case marking.

**Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Seme,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Seme. The information given primarily discusses pronouns, tone melodies, verb forms, and other grammatical aspects, but does not provide evidence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Paragraphs discuss pronouns and their usage in different syntactic positions without inflection for grammatical function, indicating no case-marking for pronouns.
   - There is no mention of noun inflections that would indicate different cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).
   - The examples provided focus on verb forms, aspect, tone melodies, and other grammatical features but do not show nouns being marked for case.

2. **Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that Koyra Chiini has no overt case marking for postverbal NPs, indicating a lack of morphological case-marking for subjects and objects.

2. **Paragraph 2**: It states that subject and direct object NPs have zero case and may be informally considered as nominative. However, there are nonzero postpositions such as Dative ""se"" and Locative ""kuna"". This suggests that while there is no case marking for core grammatical relations (subject, object), there are specific markers for certain semantic roles.

3. **Paragraph 5**: It reiterates that subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers and that most grammatical relations are expressed by postpositions. This reinforces the idea that Koyra Chiini does not use morphological case-marking for core syntactic functions but uses postpositions for other relations.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language with subjects in the nominative case, direct objects in the accusative case, and indirect objects in the dative case. It also mentions case affixes on nouns and adnominal constituents.

2. **Paragraph 2** elaborates on the case marking, indicating that Sidaama has nominative, dative-locative, allative, ablative-instrumental, accusative, oblique, and genitive cases. It specifies that the accusative and oblique cases are marked by suprafixes, while the genitive case is marked by both a suffix and a suprafix.

3. **Paragraph 3** confirms the nominative, accusative, and dative cases for pronouns, with distinct forms and pitch accent patterns.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the case marking on demonstrative pronouns and adjectives, indicating nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.

5. **Paragraph 5** provides a table showing nominative, accusative, and dative case forms for personal pronouns.

6. **Paragraph 6** mentions that grammatical cases on pronouns are distinguished by different forms and pitch accent patterns.

7. **Paragraph 8** provides a table summarizing nominative, accusative, and dative case marking on nouns, and mentions locative, allative, and ablative-instrumental suffixes.

8. **Paragraph 10** discusses the use of case suffixes and suprafixes on adjectives, indicating nominative, genitive, accusative, and oblique cases.

9. **Paragraph 16** provides examples of genitive case marking on adjectives modifying nouns.

10. **Paragraph 24** discusses the use of the dative-locative suffix and mentions the genitive stem of nouns.

11. **Paragraph 30** provides examples of the use of the possessive pronominal suffix and case suffixes, indicating genitive and dative cases.

12. **Paragraph 33** discusses the use of double case suffixes, specifically genitive followed by dative, locative, allative, ablative, or instrumental.

13. **Paragraph 34** provides a table showing different forms of the nominative case suffix.

14. **Paragraph 38** provides a table showing different forms of the genitive case suffix and mentions the use of a suprafix for genitive case marking.

15. **Paragraph 47** discusses the nominative case suffix and its use on masculine nouns.

From the information provided, Sidaama has the following productive cases:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Dative
- Genitive
- Locative
- Allative
- Ablative-Instrumental
- Oblique

This gives us a total of 8 distinct cases.

**Reasoning:**
The paragraphs indicate that Sidaama has distinct morphological markers for nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, locative, allative, ablative-instrumental, and oblique cases. These cases are marked either by suffixes, suprafixes, or both, and they apply to nouns, pronouns, and adjectives.

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Kunama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kunama, we can extract the following relevant information regarding case marking:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It mentions that inflectional case is lacking in Kunama. The primary means of expressing nominal relationships such as possession, objects, and locatives are through postpositions. There is a mention of a possible nominative case marked by tone, but this is not confirmed.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph reiterates that nominal relationships, including locatives, are expressed by postpositions. It also mentions that postpositions are self-standing words and not enclitics, suggesting they are not fully integrated into the nominal morphology as case markers.

3. **Paragraph 4**: The paragraph mentions the use of the postposition +si for dative (and also accusative) functions, reinforcing the idea that postpositions are used instead of inflectional case markers.

4. **Paragraph 30**: This paragraph provides examples of genitive constructions using the suffix -yna, indicating that genitive marking is present in Kunama.

5. **Paragraph 31**: It mentions the use of postpositions for locative and other functions, further supporting the use of postpositions rather than inflectional case markers.

6. **Paragraph 45**: Discusses the use of postpositions for indicating direct and indirect objects, again emphasizing the role of postpositions in expressing grammatical relationships.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, it is clear that Kunama primarily uses postpositions to express various grammatical relationships such as locative, dative, and accusative. The only potential inflectional case marker mentioned is the genitive suffix -yna. However, the overall system relies heavily on postpositions rather than a fully developed inflectional case system.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking

7. **Instrumental Case**:
   - Paragraph 41 also mentions the instrumental case marker, which encodes modal roles such as direct instrument, indirect instrument, and manner instrument.

8. **Comitative Case**:
   - Paragraph 30 discusses the comitative case marker, which relates one noun phrase to another, encoding several semantic roles.

### Conclusion

Based on the information provided, Alamblak exhibits a productive case system with the following identified cases: genitive, adessive, referent, specific setting, general setting, allative, instrumental, and comitative. This totals to at least eight distinct cases.

**Conclusion: 8-9 cases**",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Amele,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Amele, the information relevant to determining the number of cases in the language is somewhat scattered. However, the following points are particularly pertinent:

1. **Possession and Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that possession is expressed formally on the noun in the case of inalienably possessed nouns.
   - Paragraph 6 distinguishes between alienable and inalienable possession, with alienable possession expressed by a possessive noun phrase and inalienable possession marked on the noun itself.
   - Paragraph 40 further elaborates that alienably possessed nouns are preceded by a possessive postpositional phrase, while inalienably possessed nouns are marked for possession.

2. **Postpositional Phrases**:
   - Paragraph 20 describes the use of postpositions in Amele, indicating that postpositions can express various semantic relationships such as time, location, instrument, and possession.
   - Paragraph 48 discusses compound postpositions, which also indicate semantic functions like direction and location.

3. **Syntactic Functions**:
   - Paragraph 4 indicates that nouns can function as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, or adverbials of time, location, or manner.
   - Paragraph 45 mentions that the syntactic indirect object category can have the semantic case functions of recipient, benefactive, malefactive, and allative.

4. **Case Marking**:
   - Paragraph 11 discusses verbal object marking, where clitic object markers on the verb can distinguish direct from indirect objects.

From the above points, it is clear that Amele uses postpositions extensively to mark various semantic relationships, including possession, location, and direction. However, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns that would indicate a system of morphological case marking similar to languages with nominative, accusative, dative, etc.

Given the reliance on postpositions and the lack of evidence for a morphological case system, it is reasonable to conclude that Amele does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Arapesh (Mountain),"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system in Mountain Arapesh. The descriptions focus on noun phrase structures, verb classifications, and other grammatical features without mentioning specific case markers for nouns that would indicate a system of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, or other cases typically found in languages with morphological case-marking.

The paragraphs discuss various noun phrase structures, verb affixation, and agreement systems, but they do not provide examples of nouns being inflected for different cases. Instead, the language seems to rely on word order, verb agreement, and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships.

**Reasoning:**
1. The provided paragraphs do not mention any specific case markers or inflectional paradigms for nouns that would indicate the presence of a case system.
2. The descriptions focus on noun phrase agreement, verb morphology, and other syntactic structures without reference to case inflection.
3. The language appears to use other means, such as word order and verb agreement, to express grammatical relationships.

Batak (Karo),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karo Batak, the language does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, including noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and the use of pronouns, but there is no mention of a systematic morphological case paradigm for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, the language appears to rely on word order, prepositions, and other syntactic means to express these relationships.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 4** mentions prepositions like ""ibas"" or ""bas"" used for locative and possessive meanings, indicating that relational meanings are conveyed through prepositions rather than case inflections.
2. **Paragraph 14** discusses possessive constructions and mentions the genitive marker ""ni = nu = u"" in certain archaic expressions, but this does not constitute a productive case system.
3. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 8** describe the use of personal pronouns and clitics for subject and object roles, suggesting that pronouns, rather than nouns, carry specific forms for different syntactic functions.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 22** describe the use of prefixes for marking passive voice on verbs, but there is no indication of case marking on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 15** explicitly states that features like case-marking on pronouns do not play a part in Karo morphosyntactic organization, reinforcing the absence of a case system.

Given the absence of evidence for a productive case-marking system and the reliance on other syntactic devices, the appropriate classification for Karo Batak is:

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs, Chamorro does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The language relies heavily on word order, prepositions, and possessive pronouns to indicate grammatical relationships rather than inflectional case markers. The examples given in the paragraphs show that Chamorro uses articles, possessive pronouns, and prepositions to convey relationships that might be marked by case in other languages. There is no evidence of a systematic inflectional case paradigm for nouns that would indicate multiple cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

For instance:
- The use of possessive pronouns (e.g., -hu, -mu, -ña) to indicate possession rather than a genitive case.
- The use of prepositions like ""gi"" and ""ginen"" to indicate locative and ablative relationships.
- The absence of inflectional endings on nouns to mark different grammatical roles.

Given these observations, Chamorro fits the description of a language with ""No morphological case-marking.""

2. **Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Daga,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Daga, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various grammatical features such as clitics, pronouns, verb forms, and phrase structures, but they do not provide information about a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would indicate the presence of multiple cases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Paragraph 1**: Discusses locatives acting as pronouns but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 2**: Mentions the Substantive Clitic but does not relate it to a case system.
   - **Paragraph 5**: Talks about adjectives and their grammatical roles but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 7**: Describes the structure of the Modified Noun Phrase without reference to cases.
   - **Paragraph 9**: Lists pronouns and their forms but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 12**: Discusses the roles of pronouns in various tagmemes but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 19**: Describes the Included Clause Clitic and its forms but does not relate to a case system.
   - **Paragraph 23**: Mentions possessive pronouns but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 25**: Discusses nominalized verbs but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 29**: Describes adjectives and their grammatical roles but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 31**: Discusses Equational Clauses and their structure but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 35**: Lists postpositions and their roles but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 39**: Describes the Possessive Phrase structure but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 41**: Discusses the structure of the Ditransitive Clause but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 43**: Describes the Emphatic Intensified Phrase but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 45**: Mentions suffixes and their roles but does not indicate a case system.
   - **Paragraph 47**: Lists various tagmemes but does not mention cases.
   - **Paragraph 49**: Discusses the Location Postposition and Clitic but does not indicate a case system.

Given the lack of explicit mention of a productive case-marking system for nouns, it is reasonable to conclude that Daga does not have morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dani (Lower Grand Valley), there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The paragraphs primarily discuss case relationships marked by verbs, post-positions, and clitics, but do not provide information about a distinct set of morphological case markers directly affixed to nouns themselves.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, and 48 discuss case relationships in the context of verbs and other syntactic elements, but not as direct morphological markers on nouns.
   - The mention of case roles and relationships often pertains to how verbs interact with their arguments, rather than indicating a system of noun inflection.
   - There is no mention of a set of case suffixes or inflections that apply directly to nouns to mark grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
   - The language appears to use other means (such as word order, verb affixes, and clitics) to express grammatical relationships, rather than a productive case system on nouns.

2. **Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Hamtai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hamtai, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions objective pronoun prefixes and the presence of direct and indirect objects, but it does not provide explicit information about case marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2** indicates that both direct and indirect objects can follow or precede each other, but again, there is no mention of morphological case marking.
3. **Paragraph 11** states that nouns in object position have the same form as nouns in subject position, suggesting a lack of morphological differentiation between these roles.
4. **Paragraph 19** discusses clitics forming adverbial prepositional phrases, which might indicate some form of locative marking, but this is not explicitly tied to a productive case system on nouns.
5. **Paragraph 29** mentions a suffix for possession, which could be indicative of a genitive case, but it is not clear if this is part of a broader case system.
6. **Paragraph 48** explicitly states that the noun is not declined, which strongly suggests the absence of a morphological case system.

Given these points, it appears that Hamtai does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. The mention of possession suffixes and adverbial clitics does not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the guidelines.

**Reasoning:**
- The grammar does not provide evidence of distinct morphological case markers for different syntactic roles (e.g., nominative, accusative, dative).
- The explicit statement that nouns are not declined supports the conclusion that there is no morphological case-marking system in Hamtai.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking

Ilocano,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ilocano, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system for nouns. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Core and Oblique Cases**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that noun phrases can be marked for core cases (ergative and absolutive) and oblique cases.
   - Paragraph 3.1 (Paragraph 24) explicitly states that articles in Ilocano encode two cases: core and oblique.

2. **Ergative and Absolutive Cases**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 5 discuss the use of ergative and absolutive cases for marking the actor and non-actor in transitive verbs.
   - Paragraph 15 and Paragraph 16 further elaborate on the use of absolutive case for single arguments of intransitive verbs and patient arguments of transitive verbs.

3. **Oblique Case**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that all other nouns not in core cases are encoded in the oblique case.
   - Paragraph 24 (3.1) also confirms the presence of oblique case marking.

4. **Demonstratives and Pronouns**:
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 20 discuss how demonstratives and pronouns inflect for case, including core (ergative, absolutive) and oblique cases.

5. **Summary of Cases**:
   - The grammar outlines consistently refer to three main cases: ergative, absolutive, and oblique.

Given this information, Ilocano has a productive case system with three distinct cases: ergative, absolutive, and oblique.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, we can identify the case-marking system of the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Case Marking Overview**:
   - The case marker `-m` is primarily a goal marker but also has syntactic functions such as marking objects, recipients, and beneficiaries (Paragraphs 5, 10, 35, 49).
   - The locative case is marked by `-ia` (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).
   - The source case is marked by `-n&i` (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).
   - The instrumental case is marked by `-na` (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).

2. **Specific Case Functions**:
   - **Goal and Purpose**: The goal marker `-m` is used for goals of motion verbs and purposes (Paragraph 49).
   - **Locative**: The locative marker `-ia` indicates location (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).
   - **Source**: The source marker `-n&i` indicates the origin or source (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).
   - **Instrumental**: The instrumental marker `-na` is used for instruments (Paragraphs 5, 10, 49).

3. **Peripheral Case Relations**:
   - The language has a typical Papuan case system with peripheral case relations including locative, cause, goal, source, and instrument (Paragraph 21).
   - The goal marker `-m` can also substitute for the locative marker `-ia` in some contexts (Paragraph 21).

4. **Case Inventory**:
   - The language has a quaternary system conflating locative and cause, with the goal marker `-m` sometimes assuming the functions of `-ia` (Paragraph 21).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Imonda has a productive case-marking system with at least four distinct cases: locative, source, goal, and instrumental. Additionally, the goal marker `-m` has multiple functions, including marking recipients and beneficiaries, which suggests a complex and multifunctional case system.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",5 cases,4 cases
Atayal,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Atayal, the language exhibits three productive case paradigms for nouns: nominative, genitive, and dative.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Nominative Case:** The nominative case is used for the subject, predicate, and topic of a sentence (Paragraphs 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 16, 23).
   - **Genitive Case:** The genitive case is used to refer to possession and other functions (Paragraphs 11, 18, 20, 24, 36, 48).
   - **Dative Case:** The dative case is used for the object of prepositions and phrases meaning ""belong to"" and for expressing location (Paragraphs 6, 24, 35).

These three cases are consistently mentioned and exemplified throughout the paragraphs, indicating that they form a productive case system in Atayal.

2. **Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Kewa,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kewa, the following information is relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions that case markers in Kewa are described according to their function at various grammatical levels. It lists several semantic co-functions of grammatical functions, such as location, time, instrument, accompaniment, referent-reason, and topic. This suggests that Kewa has a variety of case markers that correspond to different semantic roles.

2. **Paragraph 21** provides examples of case markers in Kewa:
   - **-para** for locative (e.g., ""to the two good men"")
   - **-me** for instrumental (e.g., ""by means of a jeep"")
   - **-nane** for directional (e.g., ""toward the big garden"")

3. **Paragraph 23** mentions the accusative case marker **-daa**, which often marks the object-as-referent rather than simply as a goal.

4. **Paragraph 31** suggests that clitics such as **-me** and **-para** function as surface case markers for certain tagmemes, indicating that these markers are used to denote specific grammatical roles.

From this information, it is clear that Kewa has a productive system of case marking with distinct markers for various grammatical and semantic roles. Specifically, the language has at least the following cases:
- Locative (e.g., -para)
- Instrumental (e.g., -me)
- Directional (e.g., -nane)
- Accusative (e.g., -daa)

Given the presence of these markers and their distinct functions, Kewa appears to have a mid-sized inventory of cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The presence of at least four distinct case markers (locative, instrumental, directional, and accusative) indicates that Kewa has a productive case system.
- The examples provided show that these markers are used in various grammatical contexts, supporting the idea that they are part of a productive case paradigm.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",6-7 cases,4 cases

Kombai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kombai, it is evident that Kombai does not exhibit productive case paradigms for nouns. The language relies on word order, possessive pronominal prefixes, and relational nouns rather than morphological case marking to indicate grammatical relationships.

Here are the key points leading to this conclusion:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that ""Apart from the expression of possession there is no noun-related morphology."" This indicates that nouns do not inflect for case.
   
2. **Paragraph 5** discusses the use of relational nouns and verbs to express semantic relations, such as instruments, rather than using case markers.

3. **Paragraph 12** elaborates on relational nouns and their grammaticalization, but does not mention any case marking on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 21** describes the syntactic and pragmatic functions of relational nouns like ""ro"" (thing) and ""rumu"" (person), which serve as head nouns in various constructions, again without any indication of case marking.

5. **Paragraph 47** discusses the development of ""ro"" into a subordinator, indicating a shift towards grammatical functions without case marking.

6. **Paragraph 25** mentions that question-words, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses are expressed as modifiers of relational head nouns, not through case marking.

7. **Paragraph 36** defines verbs as the primary inflected category, with nouns and adjectives requiring copula-support or verbalization to function predicatively, further supporting the absence of noun case marking.

Given these observations, Kombai does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it uses other grammatical strategies to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Lavukaleve,"### Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking

**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, the language exhibits case marking primarily for spatial/relational cases, which have a low functional load. The relevant information is found in the following excerpts:

1. **Paragraph 1**: ""There is case marking for three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load.""
2. **Paragraph 2**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
3. **Paragraph 3**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
4. **Paragraph 4**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
5. **Paragraph 5**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
6. **Paragraph 6**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
7. **Paragraph 7**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
8. **Paragraph 8**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
9. **Paragraph 9**: No additional relevant information about case marking.
10. **Paragraph 10**: No additional relevant information about case marking.

The information provided indicates that Lavukaleve has overt marking for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, but does not have a more extensive or syntactically significant case system. This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete case relations and not for core syntactic roles like subject or object.

Therefore, the conclusion based on the provided information is that Lavukaleve exhibits ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Madurese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Madurese, there is no evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The language primarily uses prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relations, as seen in the examples and discussions of various sentence structures, including transitive and ditransitive clauses, and the use of prepositions for marking objects and other roles. Additionally, the discussions on morphology and syntax do not mention any case paradigms for nouns.

1. The paragraphs describe various aspects of Madurese grammar, including the use of prepositions, word order, and verbal morphology to indicate grammatical relations. There is no mention of noun inflections that would indicate a case-marking system. Instead, grammatical relations are expressed through prepositions and word order, which is typical of languages without morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mokilese,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mokilese, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns. The text does not mention any specific case markers or case distinctions that apply to nouns in a systematic way. Instead, the focus is on other grammatical features such as possessive constructions, pronouns, and determiners.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The paragraphs discuss various aspects of Mokilese grammar, including phonology, morphology, pronouns, possessive constructions, and determiners.
   - There is no mention of case markers or case distinctions for nouns that would indicate a productive case system.
   - The possessive constructions and pronouns are discussed in detail, but these do not constitute a case system as defined in the context of grammatical case.

2. **Conclusion**: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Palauan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Palauan, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of Palauan grammar, such as pronouns, verb forms, and sentence structures, but they do not mention any specific morphological case markers for nouns that would indicate a system of nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, or other cases.

The information provided focuses on pronouns, verb forms, and relational phrases, but there is no indication of a system where nouns are marked for different grammatical cases. The examples given show nouns in different syntactic positions (e.g., subject, object) but do not show any morphological changes to the nouns themselves that would indicate case marking.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Palauan does not have a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Sentani,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, the following observations can be made regarding case-marking:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of postpositions to indicate relationships such as possession, origin, and location. Examples include ""ondofolo le fola"" (the chief’s bow-and-arrow) and ""Dasim Kalawbew de omi"" (D.K.’s daughter). This suggests that Sentani uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markings to indicate these relationships.

2. **Paragraph 15** describes various postpositional constructions, such as ""ifa na"" (in the (men’s) canoe), ""bu na"" (in the water), and ""jo da"" (to the village). This further supports the idea that Sentani relies on postpositions rather than morphological case markers.

3. **Paragraph 35** discusses predicative constructions and mentions the use of postpositions for indirect objects and direction, such as ""jo da ake"" (he went to the village) and ""ime da owoke"" (he descended from the house). Again, this indicates the use of postpositions instead of morphological case markers.

4. **Paragraph 50** provides examples of subordinate clauses using the postposition ""na"" to indicate temporal and causal relationships, such as ""daje makale na"" (when I came) and ""na u kaban da ake nakawole na"" (as he went and lived in great style). This shows that Sentani uses postpositions for various syntactic functions.

5. **Paragraph 16** discusses the difficulty in distinguishing between derivational and inflectional morphology due to the strong tendency for phrase sandhi, but it does not provide evidence of morphological case marking.

6. **Paragraph 5** mentions the use of pseudo-flexion for genitive (possessive) forms through apophony, but this does not constitute a productive case paradigm.

7. **Paragraph 2** describes personal pronouns and their forms used with postpositions, indicating that postpositions are used for relational marking rather than inflectional case markers.

Based on these observations, it is clear that Sentani does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate various syntactic and semantic relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Suena,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Suena. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, such as verb forms, sentence structures, and specific examples of usage, but they do not provide evidence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

Given the absence of information on case-marking in the provided text, and assuming that the descriptive grammar would mention such a system if it existed, it is reasonable to conclude that Suena does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Reasoning:**
1. The paragraphs provided do not mention any morphological case-marking for nouns.
2. The discussion focuses on verb forms, sentence structures, and specific examples without indicating a case system.
3. If Suena had a productive case-marking system, it would likely be mentioned in the descriptive grammar.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Taba,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Taba:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that Taba has adpositions that mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases. This suggests that Taba uses adpositions rather than morphological case markers for oblique roles.

2. **Paragraph 4** discusses reflexive constructions and the use of the reflexive particle ""do,"" but it does not mention any morphological case marking on nouns.

3. **Paragraph 6** describes nominal clauses and their formal characteristics, but there is no mention of morphological case marking.

4. **Paragraph 10** states that the heads of noun phrases are always nouns and mentions various ways nouns can be qualified, but it does not mention any case marking.

5. **Paragraph 13** provides examples of nouns in different syntactic roles but does not indicate any morphological case marking.

6. **Paragraph 16** mentions the use of pronominal copies in reflexive clauses but does not indicate any morphological case marking.

7. **Paragraph 17** discusses the syntactic roles of arguments and mentions that arguments may be marked adpositionally, but it does not indicate any morphological case marking.

8. **Paragraph 18** describes a nominalisation process but does not mention any morphological case marking.

9. **Paragraph 19** discusses conjunctions and their use in noun phrases but does not mention any morphological case marking.

10. **Paragraph 22** describes the use of proclitics and enclitics but does not mention any morphological case marking.

11. **Paragraph 23** discusses the marking of number on noun phrases but does not mention any morphological case marking.

12. **Paragraph 30** mentions the use of adpositional expressions for marking extra arguments but does not indicate any morphological case marking.

13. **Paragraph 31** describes the use of prepositions and postpositions but does not mention any morphological case marking.

14. **Paragraph 37** mentions the use of prepositions to mark comitative, instrumental, and beneficiary roles but does not indicate any morphological case marking.

15. **Paragraph 48** describes particles and their use in verb phrases, noun phrases, and adpositional phrases but does not mention any morphological case marking.

From the information provided, it is clear that Taba uses adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) to mark various roles such as locative, comitative, instrumental, and beneficiary. There is no evidence of a productive morphological case paradigm for nouns. Instead, the language relies on adpositions to express these relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tagalog,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tagalog, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Tagalog has three types of marked nominals: personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns, with their functions indicated by their forms or preceding markers.
2. **Paragraph 2** and **Paragraph 3** detail the forms of personal pronouns, which change according to their function in the sentence. These forms are categorized into ang, ng, and sa forms, corresponding to different grammatical functions.
3. **Paragraph 4** and **Paragraph 5** discuss pluralization and the use of markers like mga for indicating plurality, but do not introduce additional case markers.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 7** explain that unmarked nouns do not have their functions explicitly indicated by their forms, unlike marked nouns.
5. **Paragraph 9** and **Paragraph 10** further elaborate on the use of personal pronouns and their forms in different grammatical contexts.
6. **Paragraph 18** and **Paragraph 19** describe the use of sa phrases and ng phrases, indicating that these markers are used to express different grammatical relations.
7. **Paragraph 34** explicitly states that every marked noun occurs in three different forms or with three different markers: ang, ng, and sa, each indicating a particular set of sentence functions.

From the information provided, it is clear that Tagalog uses three primary markers (ang, ng, and sa) to indicate different grammatical functions of nouns. These markers correspond to what can be considered as cases in the context of this analysis.

**Reasoning:**
- The ang form typically marks the subject or topic.
- The ng form marks possessive or genitive relations and sometimes object relations.
- The sa form marks locative, directional, or other oblique relations.

These markers are used consistently and productively across different types of nouns and pronouns, fulfilling the criteria for being considered a case system.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Tukang Besi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tukang Besi, we can extract relevant information regarding the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions the nominative case marker ""na"" and the non-nominative core marker ""te"". It also discusses the genitive case marker ""nu"" and the oblique marker ""i/di"".
2. **Paragraph 9** reiterates the presence of four articles used to mark case relations: nominative ""na"", non-nominative core ""te"", genitive ""nu"", and oblique ""i/di"".
3. **Paragraph 24** summarizes the use of the nominative ""na"" and non-nominative ""te"" in both verbal and non-verbal clauses.
4. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 13** provide examples of the genitive case marker ""nu"".
5. **Paragraph 25** discusses the structure of noun phrases and case phrases, indicating that all noun phrases must appear with a preceding article or preposition, which marks their case.
6. **Paragraph 39** provides a table summarizing the marking strategies on noun phrases, including the core articles ""na"" and ""te"", and the oblique article ""i/di"".

From these points, it is clear that Tukang Besi has a productive case-marking system with at least four distinct cases:

1. **Nominative** (na)
2. **Non-nominative core** (te)
3. **Genitive** (nu)
4. **Oblique** (i/di)

### Conclusion:
4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Una,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Una, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Una has a case system that marks semantic relationships between participants, locations, and objects within a clause. It lists several case markers, including vocative, nominative, genitive, locative, allative, instrumental, referential, and reflexive.

2. **Paragraph 2** provides more details about these cases:
   - Nominative: marks the subject of an intransitive verb.
   - Genitive: indicates possession.
   - Locative: indicates location (at, on, in, within, from).
   - Allative: indicates direction towards (to, towards).
   - Instrumental: indicates means or accompaniment (with, by).
   - Referential: indicates reference or concern (for, concerning, about, regarding).
   - Reflexive: indicates reflexivity or emphasis (-self).

3. **Paragraph 3** confirms the use of the nominative case for subjects of intransitive verbs.

4. **Paragraph 4** discusses the ergative case, which marks the subject of a transitive verb.

5. **Paragraph 5** elaborates on the dative case, which marks the indirect object of the verb (the person to whom the action is designated).

6. **Paragraph 6** describes the reflexive case in more detail, indicating its use for reflexive actions and emphasis.

7. **Paragraph 7** provides examples of the genitive case, showing its use to indicate possession.

8. **Paragraph 8** discusses the locative case in more detail, indicating both exterior (adessive) and interior (inessive) locations.

9. **Paragraph 9** confirms the ergative case and provides examples.

10. **Paragraph 10** mentions the instrumental case, indicating means or accompaniment.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive cases in Una:
- Nominative
- Genitive
- Locative
- Allative
- Instrumental
- Referential
- Reflexive
- Ergative
- Dative

This gives us a total of nine distinct cases. Therefore, the number of cases in Una falls into the category of ""8-9 cases.""

**Conclusion:** 8-9 cases",no morphological case-marking,8-9 cases
Usan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Usan, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points relevant to determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses possessive pronouns and their usage but does not indicate any morphological case-marking on nouns.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Similar to Paragraph 1, it focuses on possessive pronouns and reflexives without mentioning case-marking.
3. **Paragraph 4**: Mentions postpositions used for comitative relations, indicating that relational meanings are expressed through postpositions rather than case inflections.
4. **Paragraph 5**: Discusses the structure of noun phrases and the genitive-noun order but does not mention morphological case-marking.
5. **Paragraph 9**: States that nouns in Usan do not have inflection, which implies the absence of morphological case-marking.
6. **Paragraph 16**: Mentions that Usan is a postpositional language, which typically correlates with a lack of morphological case-marking.
7. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses medial verbs and their role in clause chaining, which is unrelated to case-marking on nouns.
8. **Paragraph 26**: Describes the function of the determiner ""eng"" and its use in various constructions, but does not indicate case-marking.
9. **Paragraph 34**: Provides a formula for noun phrases, including possessive and qualifying elements, but does not mention case-marking.

From the information provided, it is clear that Usan uses postpositions and other syntactic means to express relational meanings rather than morphological case-marking on nouns. The explicit statement in Paragraph 9 that nouns do not inflect supports the conclusion that Usan lacks morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yimas,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can determine the number of productive cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **General Case Marking**:
   - Yimas has a single oblique case inflection, which marks nouns functioning in an instrumental or locative role (Section 3.1, 3.2, 4.1.1).
   - The oblique case suffix is -n or -nan (Section 3.1, 4.1.1, 4.2).
   - Examples of the oblique case include ""nam-n"" (in the house), ""wanwa-n"" (with a knife), and ""tmat-jlan"" (on another day) (Section 3.1).

2. **Absence of Other Cases**:
   - There is no mention of other productive case markers for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive.
   - The language relies heavily on pronominal affixes on verbs to indicate grammatical relations (Section 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3).
   - The pronominal affixes on verbs indicate the roles of core nominals, functioning similarly to case markers in other languages (Section 5.1.1).

3. **Possession**:
   - Possession is marked by a particle postposed to the possessor, not by a case suffix (Section 3.1, 4.5).

4. **Locational and Instrumental Marking**:
   - Locational and instrumental roles are marked by the oblique case suffix -n or -nan (Section 3.1, 4.2).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Yimas has a single productive case, the oblique case, which is used for marking locative and instrumental roles. There are no other productive case markers for core grammatical relations. Therefore, the number of productive cases in Yimas is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can identify the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological markers and their functions. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Nominative and Accusative Cases**:
   - The nominative case marker ""te"" is used optionally to mark subjects, both intransitive and transitive (Paragraph 1, 3, 7).
   - The accusative case marker ""ke"" is used to mark objects and can also mark locations or temporal expressions (Paragraph 1, 3, 7, 15).

2. **Dative Case**:
   - The dative case marker ""ni"" is used to mark beneficiaries, purposes, addressees, or non-patient-like complements of certain verbs (Paragraph 15).

3. **Instrumental Case**:
   - The instrumental case marker ""fini"" or ""namu"" is used to mark instruments or source materials and certain temporal expressions (Paragraph 15).

4. **Comitative Case**:
   - The comitative case marker ""kumu"" is used to indicate accompaniment (Paragraph 15).

5. **Optional Nature and Pragmatic Function**:
   - The case markers ""te"" and ""ke"" are optional and can be left out when the context makes the syntactic roles clear. They also have pragmatic functions (Paragraph 3, 7, 15, 16).

6. **Postpositional Case Markers**:
   - The language uses postpositional case markers to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles (Paragraph 15, 27).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Aghu has a productive case system with at least five distinct cases: nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, and comitative. Therefore, the number of cases in Aghu is best categorized as:

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",no morphological case-marking,5 cases

Duna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can identify several instances of case-marking that are relevant to determining the number of productive cases in the language:

1. **Contrasted Subject (CS) Marking**:
   - Paragraph 2 discusses the use of the contrasted subject marker -ka, which is used to distinguish the subject NP from other clausal participants or to highlight the identity of the subject.
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of CS marking in nominal phrases, indicating its role in marking subjects.

2. **Locative and Beneficiary/Possessor Marking**:
   - Paragraph 3 also mentions the NP marker (§6.3) which is obligatory in nominal phrases that include a spatial demonstrative.
   - Paragraph 18 discusses the use of the postposition -ya for marking beneficiaries or possessors.

3. **Instrumental and Other Role-Marking Postpositions**:
   - Paragraph 25 mentions the instrumental marker -ka and the accompanier marker -aka.
   - Paragraph 18 also discusses the use of the locative marker -ta and the concealing/inner place marker -ra.

4. **Specificity and Grouphood Marking**:
   - Paragraph 8 discusses the specificity marker -na, which can be added to verbs and nouns to indicate specificity or definiteness.
   - Paragraph 16 mentions the use of the enclosure marker -nda to form nouns denoting enclosures or shelters.

5. **Dependent Third Person Pronouns**:
   - Paragraph 4 discusses the use of dependent third person pronouns, which can be encliticized to NPs and typically reference subjects.

6. **Other Case-Like Markers**:
   - Paragraph 11 mentions the use of evidential markers and information status markers, which, while not strictly cases, indicate the speaker's epistemic stance and can affect the interpretation of the clause.

From these observations, we can identify several productive case markers in Duna:
- Contrasted Subject (CS) marker -ka
- Locative marker -ta
- Beneficiary/Possessor marker -ya
- Instrumental marker -ka
- Enclosure marker -nda
- Specificity marker -na

These markers indicate that Duna has a system of morphological case-marking that includes at least six distinct cases: nominative (CS), locative, beneficiary/possessor, instrumental, enclosure, and specificity.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",no morphological case-marking,6-7 cases

Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant morphological and syntactic features described.

1. **Paragraph 3** (Typological profile):
   - It explicitly states: ""There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it indicates an associative plural.""
   - This indicates that Mian does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

2. **Paragraph 5** (Grammatical relations):
   - It mentions: ""Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked.""
   - This further supports the absence of morphological case-marking for objects.

3. **Paragraph 17** (Properties common to all nouns):
   - It states: ""Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather, verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause.""
   - This confirms that Mian does not use morphological case-marking on nouns.

4. **Paragraph 1** (Noun phrase syntax):
   - The description of noun phrase structure does not mention any case markers, focusing instead on the order of adjectives, possessors, and determiners.

5. **Paragraph 4** (Attributive possession):
   - The possessive construction involves juxtaposition of possessor and possessed without any case marking.

6. **Paragraph 6** (Simple spatial postpositional phrases):
   - The use of postpositions derived from nouns (e.g., tem ‘in(to)’, dim ‘on(to)’) indicates that spatial relations are expressed through postpositions rather than case markers.

7. **Paragraph 15** (Polarity):
   - This paragraph discusses gender polarity and agreement patterns but does not mention any case-marking.

8. **Paragraph 16** (Head-internal relative clauses):
   - The description of relative clauses does not involve any case-marking on the nouns.

9. **Paragraph 18** (Topic-only questions):
   - The formation of topic-only questions does not involve any case-marking.

10. **Paragraph 19** (Object suffix - indirective alignment):

Inanwatan,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we need to determine the number of productive case paradigms of nouns in the Inanwatan language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 5** mentions that personal pronouns in Inanwatan are differentiated for subject, object, emphatic subject, and oblique functions. This indicates that there are at least distinct forms for subject and object, and possibly oblique cases.

2. **Paragraph 11** provides a set of subject and object prefixes for verbs, showing clear morphological distinctions between subjects and objects. This suggests the presence of at least nominative (subject) and accusative (object) cases.

3. **Paragraph 28** discusses peripheral nominals marked by postpositions, such as -go for circumstantial relations (time, place, instrument, manner), indicating that Inanwatan uses postpositions for some semantic roles rather than inflectional case marking.

4. **Paragraph 30** describes possessive prefixes for inalienable nouns, which do not differentiate gender but indicate possession. This is more about possessive constructions rather than a genitive case.

5. **Paragraph 31** mentions the use of postpositions for peripheral functions like instrument, place, and time, which are not typically considered core grammatical cases.

6. **Paragraph 33** states that gender in nouns is determined by the last vowel, and there is a distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns, but this does not directly relate to case marking.

7. **Paragraph 44** describes the use of the topic marker/subordinator -qe(de) for relative and adverbial clauses, which is more about clause structure than case marking.

8. **Paragraph 47** provides examples of question words with peripheral functions marked by postpositions, reinforcing the use of postpositions for non-core grammatical relations.

From the information above, it is clear that Inanwatan has distinct morphological markers for subjects and objects, suggesting at least two cases (nominative and accusative). The use of postpositions for other roles like instrument, place, and time indicates that these are not marked by inflectional case but by separate words.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,2 cases
Abui,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Abui, it is evident that Abui does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. The language uses pronominal prefixes to indicate possession and argument roles, but there is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that marks nouns for grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, Abui relies on word order, pronominal prefixes, and serial verb constructions to convey syntactic and semantic relationships between clausal constituents.

For instance, the excerpts discuss the use of pronominal prefixes for possession (e.g., ""ne-fala"" for ""my house"") and the use of serial verb constructions to indicate various roles and relationships within the sentence. Additionally, the grammar explicitly states that ""nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or gender are not found in Abui.""

Given this information, it is clear that Abui does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Conclusion:**
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can identify the following productive case paradigms:

1. **Object Case**:
   - The object case is marked by suffixes such as -re/-te for nouns and pronouns (e.g., ""yaw-re"" for 'pig-O', ""Peyaw-re"" for 'Peyaw-O').
   - Object marking is obligatory for pronouns and personal names, and optional for common nouns depending on their empathy hierarchy.

2. **Instrumental/Comitative Case**:
   - The instrumental/comitative case is marked by the suffix -k (e.g., ""yekne-re-k"" for 'with an axe', ""wan-e-k"" for 'with me').
   - This case marks instruments and comitatives, and it is always attached to a form with object marking.

3. **Possessive Case**:
   - The possessive case is marked by the suffix -ke (e.g., ""yen-ke"" for 'your', ""KewmalY-ke"" for 'Kewmaey's').
   - This case is used to indicate possession and is applied to personal pronouns and nouns marked for number.

4. **Locative/Directional Case**:
   - The locative/directional case is marked by suffixes such as -ke/-ko/-ka after vowels and -e/-o/-a after consonants (e.g., ""Kamla-kw-o"" for 'in Kamnum', ""wiytape-yapo-ke"" for 'to/from/at a real big river').
   - This case marks the source or goal of motion and the location of a state, process, or action.

5. **Vocative Case**:
   - The vocative case is mentioned but not elaborated on in the provided paragraphs. It is typically used for direct address.

### Conclusion:
**5 cases**

The language Awtuw has a productive case system with at least five distinct cases: object, instrumental/comitative, possessive, locative/directional, and vocative.",5 cases,5 cases
Mpur,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made regarding the presence and nature of case marking in Mpur:

1. **Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2**: These paragraphs discuss the use of spatial nouns and person prefixes in locative phrases, indicating that spatial relations are marked by prepositions and possibly person prefixes, but there is no clear evidence of a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph describes the types of nouns in Mpur, including possessive inflection by means of bound pronouns and the use of verbs for possession. However, it does not mention any case marking for grammatical relations.

3. **Paragraph 6**: Discusses verb sequences and serialization, but does not provide information on case marking.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Details the use of free and bound pronouns, with bound pronouns serving as subject markers on verbs and possessive markers on inalienable nouns. This suggests that grammatical relations are marked by pronouns rather than case inflections on nouns.

5. **Paragraph 10 and Paragraph 11**: These paragraphs describe the use of locative prepositions and spatial nouns to indicate spatial orientation, again relying on prepositions rather than case marking.

6. **Paragraph 17**: Discusses inalienable nouns and their possessive prefixes, but does not indicate any case marking for other grammatical relations.

7. **Paragraph 20**: Mentions the use of prepositions for locative phrases, reinforcing the idea that spatial relations are marked by prepositions rather than case inflections.

8. **Paragraph 21**: Discusses clitics and their functions, but does not provide evidence of case marking.

9. **Paragraph 31**: Describes the use of directional prepositions with spatial nouns, further supporting the use of prepositions for indicating spatial relations.

10. **Paragraph 32**: Provides examples of locative phrases with prepositions and spatial nouns, consistent with the use of prepositions rather than case marking.

From the provided information, it is evident that Mpur relies heavily on prepositions and person prefixes to indicate spatial relations and possession. There is no clear evidence of a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, spatial and possessive relations are marked by prepositions and bound pronouns.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking.",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 6** (5.10 Relational Nouns and the Locative/Instrumental Clitic):
   - The clitic `=k` functions as a case marker covering locative (LOC) and instrumental (INS) meanings. This indicates the presence of at least two cases: locative and instrumental.

2. **Paragraph 7** (Relational Nouns):
   - Relational nouns like `kana` ('with') and `yungu` ('like') are used to signal semantic relationships between noun phrases and verbs. These relational nouns might be analyzed as postpositions rather than true case markers.

3. **Paragraph 10** (5.4.2 Object Pronouns):
   - The discussion of object pronouns and their usage does not indicate additional case markers beyond the locative and instrumental.

4. **Paragraph 11** (5.4.3 Imperative Pronouns):
   - This section discusses imperative pronouns but does not provide evidence of additional case markers.

5. **Paragraph 16** (5.4.8 Reflexive kuna):
   - The reflexive word `kuna` is used to indicate coreference between participants but does not function as a case marker.

6. **Paragraph 23** (5.9 Relative Clauses):
   - Relative clauses precede the head noun and are not marked by specific case morphology.

7. **Paragraph 24** (5.14 Noun Phrase Structure):
   - The structure of noun phrases includes determiners, possessive pronouns, adjectives, and numerals, but there is no mention of additional case markers.

8. **Paragraph 25** (5.11.1 Asymmetrical Compounds):
   - This section discusses compound nouns and their stress patterns but does not provide information on case marking.

9. **Paragraph 26** (5.11.3 Animals and Plant Names):
   - Animal and plant names are discussed in terms of compound structure, not case marking.

10. **Paragraph 27** (5.4.7 Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns):
    - Interrogative and indefinite pronouns are discussed, but there is no mention of additional case markers.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Mehek has overt marking for locative and instrumental cases through the clitic `=k`. There is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms for nouns beyond these two cases. Therefore, the number of cases in Mehek is:

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Abun:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It is stated that Abun subjects and objects are encoded by word order alone, with no case-marking or other coding devices to signify subjects or objects. This indicates a lack of morphological case-marking for core grammatical relations.

2. **Paragraph 2**: Reiterates that Abun does not mark the case of nouns and that grammatical relations are normally marked by word order.

3. **Paragraph 3**: Discusses the agglutinating nature of Abun and mentions that grammatical relations are defined by word order and prepositions for obliques, rather than by affixation.

4. **Paragraph 7**: Confirms that there is no case marking on nouns in Abun and that objects are identified solely by word order.

5. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions that Abun uses prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking.

6. **Paragraph 16**: States that Abun lacks any form of case marking, which is not a means through which a complement clause could be marked.

7. **Paragraph 17**: Indicates that Abun pronouns are invariant in form, irrespective of their grammatical role (subject, object, or possessor).

8. **Paragraph 22**: Describes the use of negative particles and the lack of variation for tense, aspect, number, or agreement, consistent with the isolating nature of Abun.

9. **Paragraph 30**: Discusses prepositional phrases filling various grammatical roles (dative, locative, instrumental, etc.), indicating that these roles are marked by prepositions rather than case affixes.

10. **Paragraph 43**: Provides examples of relative clauses and mentions that word order is sufficient to locate gaps created by the omission of the head, further emphasizing the reliance on word order rather than case marking.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence provided in the paragraphs, it is clear that Abun does not employ morphological case-marking for grammatical relations. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical roles.

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Pomo (Southeastern),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the information relevant to determining the number of cases in Southeastern Pomo is somewhat fragmented. However, several key points can be extracted:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions suffixes like ""-it"" and ""-baq"" but does not provide clear information on the number of cases.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses postpositional phrases and mentions that the benefactive is treated as a postposition rather than a case suffix.
3. **Paragraph 3** describes possessive suffixes and locative suffixes like ""-baq"" and ""-ytin,"" indicating some form of case marking for possession and location.
4. **Paragraph 5** lists various suffixes that indicate grammatical relations, including locative and instrumental markers.
5. **Paragraph 31** provides examples of benefactive suffixes like ""-itib,"" suggesting a productive system of case marking for specific roles.
6. **Paragraph 37** mentions a locative suffix ""-we"" and provides an example of a locative phrase.
7. **Paragraph 38** lists various suffixes for different grammatical relations, including possessive and locative markers.

From these observations, it is clear that Southeastern Pomo uses suffixes to mark several grammatical relations, including possession, location, and benefactive roles. However, the exact number of distinct cases is not explicitly detailed in the provided paragraphs. The presence of locative and instrumental markers, along with possessive suffixes, suggests that the language has a system of case marking that goes beyond purely syntactic roles and includes semantic roles.

Given the evidence of multiple specific suffixes for different roles, it is reasonable to conclude that Southeastern Pomo has a system of case marking, but it is not extensive enough to be classified as having a large number of cases.

**Reasoning:**
- The language has productive case marking for possession, location, and benefactive roles.
- The presence of specific suffixes for these roles indicates a system of case marking.
- The number of distinct cases appears to be limited, likely falling within the range of 2 to 5 cases.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",6-7 cases,4 cases

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Squamish, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Case Prefixes**:
   - Paragraph 16 (XIV CASE-PREFIX) mentions that Squamish has two case forms: Absolutive and Relative. The Absolutive case is unmarked, while the Relative case is marked by a prefix /t-/. This prefix is added to articles or demonstrative substitutes, indicating a syntactic relationship other than the subject or direct object.
   - The Relative case is used for various syntactic functions, including marking secondary relata (R2) and initiators of actions in passive constructions.

2. **Nominal Expressions**:
   - Paragraph 18 (XXIII NOMINAL EXPRESSIONS) and Paragraph 24 (XXIV SECONDARY RELATA) provide examples of nominal expressions and their syntactic roles. The Relative case is used to mark nominal secondary relata, which correspond to English prepositional phrases or objects of prepositions.

3. **Productivity and Use**:
   - The Relative case prefix /t-/ is used productively in various syntactic constructions, indicating that it is an integral part of the language's grammar. It is used with articles, demonstratives, and in marking secondary relata in sentences.

4. **Absence of Other Cases**:
   - There is no mention of additional case markers beyond the Absolutive and Relative cases. The grammar does not describe any other morphological case markers for functions such as dative, genitive, instrumental, etc.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, Squamish has a productive case system with two cases: Absolutive (unmarked) and Relative (marked by the prefix /t-/). There is no indication of additional morphological case markers beyond these two.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases
Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can analyze the case system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that the determinative category of nouns is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative. The definitive case uses gender-number suffixes, the non-definitive case uses no inflectional suffixes, and the locative case is expressed by one of three locative suffixes.

2. **Paragraph 1**: It provides examples of the use of the non-definitive and locative cases. The non-definitive case is used as objects of postpositions and as modifiers of auxiliary and active verbs. The locative case is used similarly but is explicitly marked with locative suffixes.

3. **Paragraph 12**: It reiterates that the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.

4. **Paragraph 11**: It describes the locative suffixes used in the formation of the locative case and mentions that these suffixes are mutually exclusive with gender-number suffixes.

5. **Paragraph 7**: It mentions that nouns in the definitive case take gender-number suffixes, while the locative case uses locative suffixes.

From these points, we can conclude that Tunica has a system of three productive cases:

- **Definitive Case**: Marked by gender-number suffixes.
- **Non-definitive Case**: Unmarked, serving as a default or base form.
- **Locative Case**: Marked by one of three locative suffixes.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,3 cases
Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no clear evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Washo. The term ""case"" appears frequently, but it is used in a general sense rather than referring to grammatical case marking on nouns. There is no mention of specific case markers or a system of morphological case marking that would indicate the presence of a case system.

Given the lack of explicit information about morphological case marking on nouns, the most appropriate conclusion is that Washo does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wichita,"Based on the provided paragraphs, it is clear that Wichita does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. The paragraphs mention various grammatical elements and constructions, but there is no evidence of a systematic morphological case paradigm for marking syntactic relations on nouns. Instead, the language appears to rely on other grammatical strategies, such as word order, verb morphology, and possibly adpositions or particles, to indicate grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - The paragraphs do not provide any examples of nouns being inflected for case.
   - There is no mention of a case system or specific case markers that apply to nouns.
   - The language seems to use other means (e.g., verb morphology, word order) to convey grammatical relationships.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wintu, the language exhibits a system of morphological case-marking. Here is the reasoning for determining the number of cases:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions inalienably possessed nouns being inflected for three cases: an object case, a possessive case, and an instrumental case. It also states that both possessive and instrumental functions are marked by a single case, the genitive, for alienably possessed nouns.
   
2. **Paragraph 3** states that nouns are inflected for three morphological cases.

3. **Paragraph 6** lists the case suffixes: {um} for the object case, {un} for the genitive case, {in} for the locative case, {r} for the instrumental case, and {t} for the possessive case.

4. **Paragraph 7** describes the relational role of the substantival morphological cases, marking subjects, objects, instrumentality, location, and possession.

5. **Paragraph 10** mentions that non-possessed nouns are maximally inflected for three cases.

6. **Paragraph 14** lists four case suffixes: object, possessive, instrumental, and locative.

7. **Paragraph 17** states that alienably possessed nouns are inflected for three cases: object, genitive, and locative.

8. **Paragraph 31** mentions that pronouns distinguish six cases: subject, object, dependent possessive, independent possessive, instrumental, and locative.

From the information provided, it is clear that Wintu has a productive case system with at least the following cases:
- Object case
- Genitive case
- Locative case
- Instrumental case
- Possessive case

Given the evidence of these five distinct cases, the appropriate classification for Wintu's case system is:

**Conclusion: 5 cases**",4 cases,5 cases
Acoma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Acoma, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 7**: ""Nouns do not distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for a possessor, with distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession.""
   - This indicates that Acoma nouns do not have morphological case marking.

2. **Paragraph 14**: ""Laguna marks two roles morphologically: actor and undergoer. The actor corresponds to the subject in all cases except with impersonal verbs where it is simply a dummy argument. The undergoer corresponds to the subject with intransitive verbs, to the object with transitive verbs, and to the recipient with ditransitive verbs.""
   - This suggests that Acoma uses a system of marking roles on verbs rather than on nouns, which is consistent with a lack of nominal case marking.

3. **Paragraph 23**: ""It is for this reason that Laguna cannot be analyzed as having a fourth person or an obviative, as Miller and Valiquette have done. In true obviative systems, such as those in Algonquian languages, the distinction between the third and fourth person is maintained across both (di)transitive and intransitive clauses, which is not the case in Laguna.""
   - This further supports the idea that Acoma does not use nominal case marking but rather relies on verbal morphology to indicate roles.

4. **Paragraph 36**: ""Often the predicate in such a question is just a noun or pronoun, either singular or plural, with no verb.""
   - This suggests that nouns and pronouns do not carry case markers to indicate their grammatical roles.

5. **Paragraph 50**: ""There are several issues which this description raises: 1. The Set A prefixes seem to basically be subject prefixes, even in the case of Impersonal verbs which have no subject either syntactically or semantically. Yet, with transitive and ditransitive verbs they also seem to code for a third person argument, either object or recipient.""
   - This indicates that grammatical relations are marked on the verb rather than the noun, consistent with a lack of nominal case marking.

Given the information from these paragraphs, it is clear that Acoma does not use morphological case marking on nouns. Instead, it relies on verbal morphology to indicate grammatical roles.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aleut, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about case paradigms and their productivity.

1. **Paragraph 6** mentions that Aleut has two grammatical (relational) cases for ordinary nouns: absolutive and relative. It also states that Aleut has only two local cases, called locative and ablative, which are limited to positional nouns and certain adverbs.
   
2. **Paragraph 1** and **Paragraph 13** discuss the transformation of the ergative system in Aleut and the loss of oblique cases, indicating that Aleut does not have a complex case system like Eskimo.

3. **Paragraph 32** and **Paragraph 42** further support the presence of locative and ablative cases for positional nouns and certain adverbs, but these are not part of the core grammatical cases for ordinary nouns.

4. **Paragraph 40** and **Paragraph 41** provide examples of possessive suffixes and their usage, but these do not constitute additional grammatical cases.

5. **Paragraph 17** summarizes the inflectional system of Aleut, confirming the presence of absolutive and relative cases for ordinary nouns and the use of possessive suffixes.

From the information provided, it is clear that Aleut has a minimal case system with two primary grammatical cases for ordinary nouns: absolutive and relative. The locative and ablative cases are restricted to positional nouns and certain adverbs, which do not contribute to the core case system of ordinary nouns.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",2 cases,2 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following key points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Barbareño Chumash:

1. **Agglutinative and Head-Marking Language**:
   - Barbareño Chumash is described as an agglutinative language with significant head-marking on verbs, and no case marking on nouns (Paragraph 1).

2. **No Case Marking on Nouns**:
   - It is explicitly stated that there is no case marking on nouns in Barbareño Chumash (Paragraph 1).

3. **Grammatical Relations**:
   - Grammatical relations are marked on the verb, showing a nominative-accusative pattern (Paragraph 1).

4. **Absence of Canonical Adpositions**:
   - There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives in the language (Paragraph 1).

5. **Pronominal Affixes**:
   - Pronominal affixes on verbs indicate grammatical relations, showing a nominative-accusative pattern (Paragraph 1).

### Conclusion:
Based on the explicit statement that there is no case marking on nouns in Barbareño Chumash and the description of grammatical relations being marked on the verb, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Barbareño Chumash is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Comanche,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Comanche, we can extract the relevant information regarding the case system of the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that ""The noun and its modifiers are inflected for case (subjective, objective, and possessive) and number (singular, dual, and plural).""
2. **Paragraph 4** reiterates that ""Nouns are inflected for case (subjective, objective, and possessive) and for number (singular, dual, and plural).""
3. **Paragraph 10** provides examples of objective case marking: ""He sees a horse. [puki u vunni] horse-OBJ see-CMPL:ASP"" and ""He sees the house. [kahni 'u venni] house-OBJ he see.""
4. **Paragraph 11** discusses the use of subjective, objective, and possessive cases in pronouns: ""Pronoun stems are inflected for first, second, and third person; and for subjective, objective, and possessive case and singular, dual, and plural number.""
5. **Paragraph 15** states, ""The subject is in subjective case and the object or objects take objective case.""
6. **Paragraph 23** mentions possessive forms in relative clauses: ""When the relative clause modifies the subject of the main verb, the verb of the subject of the relative clause is in possessive form.""

From these points, it is clear that Comanche has a productive case system with at least three distinct cases: subjective (nominative), objective (accusative), and possessive (genitive).

### Conclusion:
3 cases",3 cases,3 cases
Kiowa,"To determine the number of cases in Kiowa, we need to analyze the provided paragraphs for any mention of morphological case-marking on nouns. Here is the analysis based on the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses various syntactic constructions in Kiowa, including relative clauses and noun phrases.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yup'ik (Central),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Yup'ik, we can identify several distinct cases used in the language. Here is the reasoning based on the information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Absolutive Case**: Used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs.
2. **Relative Case**: Used for the subject of transitive verbs and the possessor of another noun.
3. **Ablative-Modalis Case**: Used for indefinite objects, indicating the place from which motion occurs, and for specification.
4. **Terminalis Case**: Indicates the place to which motion occurs and is used for the subject of embedded transitive verbs.
5. **Localis Case**: Indicates the place at which something occurs.
6. **Vialis Case**: Indicates the route or means by which something occurs.
7. **Equalis Case**: Indicates similarity or comparison.

From the paragraphs, we can identify at least seven distinct cases: Absolutive, Relative, Ablative-Modalis, Terminalis, Localis, Vialis, and Equalis. This suggests that Central Yup'ik has a productive case system with at least 6-7 cases.

**Reasoning**:
- The Absolutive and Relative cases are clearly defined and used for core syntactic functions.
- The Ablative-Modalis, Terminalis, Localis, Vialis, and Equalis cases are used for various oblique and semantic functions.
- The presence of these cases indicates a robust system of morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion**: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Yurok,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, there is no clear evidence of a productive case-marking system for nouns. The information provided focuses on various aspects of Yurok grammar, including verb forms, word order, pronominal prefixes, and other morphological and syntactical features, but it does not indicate the presence of a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The paragraphs discuss verb forms, pronominal prefixes, and other syntactical structures but do not mention any specific case markers for nouns.
   - There is no indication of a system where nouns change form based on their syntactic or semantic role in the sentence, which is a key characteristic of case-marking systems.
   - The examples provided in the paragraphs show nouns in various contexts but do not demonstrate any morphological changes that would indicate case distinctions.

2. **Conclusion**:
   - No morphological case-marking

Therefore, based on the information provided, Yurok appears to lack a productive morphological case-marking system for nouns.",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Zuni,"1. **Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Zuni, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant information about noun inflections and pronoun paradigms.

- **Paragraph 2** mentions that nouns are inflected for number, and pronouns are inflected for number and case.
- **Paragraph 3** provides a table of personal pronouns differentiated for number (singular, dual, plural) and for case (subject, object, possessive). This indicates that Zuni has at least three cases for pronouns.
- **Paragraph 4** states that pronoun inflection includes case as well as number, and that pronouns will be treated synthetically as paradigmatic forms rather than analytically as forms composed of stem and suffix.
- **Paragraph 10** indicates that nouns are inflected only for number (singular and plural), and there is no mention of additional case markers for nouns.

From this information, it is clear that Zuni has a productive case system for pronouns, with three distinct cases (subject, object, possessive). However, for nouns, there is no mention of additional case markers beyond number inflection.

Given that the case system is productive for pronouns but not for nouns, the appropriate classification for Zuni would be ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This classification is used for languages that have overt marking only for concrete (or ""peripheral"", or “semantic”) case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, but do not have a full case-marking system for nouns.

2. **Conclusion:**
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Columbia-Wenatchi,"Based on the provided paragraphs, the evidence suggests that Columbia-Wenatchi has a system of case-marking, but it is not extensive. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the ""absolutive case"" for the subject.
2. **Paragraph 10** refers to ""direct case"" for the agent and ""oblique"" for the patient.
3. **Paragraph 11** also mentions ""direct case"" for both agent and patient in certain constructions.
4. **Paragraph 22** mentions ""quirky case"" for topical object agents, which is a noted property of ergative arguments.
5. **Paragraph 25** refers to ""ergative case"" for agents of transitive verbs and ""absolutive"" for agents of intransitives.
6. **Paragraph 45** mentions ""quirky case"" for the ergative argument (transitive subject).

From these references, we can infer the presence of at least the following cases:
- Absolutive
- Ergative
- Direct
- Oblique
- Quirky (which might be a specific instance of oblique or another case)

Given this information, Columbia-Wenatchi appears to have a system with at least four distinct cases: absolutive, ergative, direct, and oblique. The mention of quirky case might suggest a fifth, but it could also be a specific instance of one of the other cases.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Tlingit,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in Tlingit. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions ""borderline case"" and ""locative words,"" indicating some form of locative marking.
2. **Paragraph 2** discusses ""limited inflectional suffixation"" among nominal and locative words, suggesting that there is some morphological marking but it is not extensive.
3. **Paragraph 5** mentions ""locative phrases"" and ""indefinite locative,"" indicating the presence of locative case marking.
4. **Paragraph 6** defines various phrase types, including nominal and locative phrases, and mentions that nominal phrases are not followed by locative markers, implying that locative markers are used in specific contexts.
5. **Paragraph 9** describes compound noun stems involving locative roots, indicating the use of locative elements in noun formation.
6. **Paragraph 10** outlines the functions of nominal phrases, including subject, object, indirect object, and extension, but does not mention extensive case marking for these roles.
7. **Paragraph 12** discusses the structure of nominal phrases and their agreement with pronominal prefixes in verbs, but again, no extensive case marking is mentioned.
8. **Paragraph 19** mentions inflectional components in verb stems but does not provide evidence of extensive case marking on nouns.
9. **Paragraph 22** describes the nominal phrase functioning as an object and its agreement with pronominal words, indicating some form of marking but not a full case system.
10. **Paragraph 45** discusses locative phrases functioning as adverbial phrases, again indicating the presence of locative marking.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Tlingit exhibits some form of locative marking and possibly other peripheral case relations, but there is no evidence of a full, productive case paradigm for nouns. The marking seems to be limited to specific contexts, particularly locative and possibly instrumental functions.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet:

1. **Obviation and Possession**:
   - The language marks nouns for obviative (distanced) and proximate (focus of attention) distinctions, particularly for animate nouns. This is a feature of many Algonquian languages but does not necessarily constitute a case system in the traditional sense.
   - Possession is marked on the possessed noun rather than the possessor, with specific forms for possessed nouns (e.g., npihtin 'my hand', kpihtin 'your hand').

2. **Locative Inflection**:
   - There is a locative inflection for nouns, which is marked by endings such as -ok for singular and -ihkuk for plural (e.g., wikuwamok 'in, on, at the house').

3. **Absentative Forms**:
   - Nouns and pronouns have absentative forms to indicate absence in time or space, but this is more about marking absence rather than a productive case system.

4. **No True Adjectives**:
   - The language uses preverbs, prenouns, or other initial roots to carry adjectival meanings, indicating a complex morphological structure but not necessarily a case system.

5. **Possessed Inflection**:
   - Possessed forms of nouns are marked differently, and there are specific forms for dependent nouns that exist only in possessed forms.

6. **Verb Agreement**:
   - Verbs agree with nouns in terms of animacy and obviation, but this agreement is not the same as a case system marking syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, etc.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet does not exhibit a productive case system for marking syntactic roles of nouns. Instead, it uses a combination of obviation, possession markers, and locative inflections. The presence of locative inflection and the absence of a broader case system suggest that the language has ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Tsimshian (Coast),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in the Coast Tsimshian language by analyzing the relevant information about its grammatical structure, particularly focusing on the presence and function of case markers.

### Analysis:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Tsimshian distinguishes between absolutive and ergative noun phrases.
   - Subjects of intransitive sentences and direct objects of transitive sentences are marked as absolutive.
   - Subjects of transitive sentences are marked as ergative.

2. **Paragraph 4**:
   - Topicalized ergatives must be expressed by pronouns, not by nouns.
   - This suggests a syntactic distinction but does not necessarily indicate additional morphological cases beyond ergative and absolutive.

3. **Paragraph 7**:
   - Discusses possessive constructions using enclitics (-a/null for common nouns, -as/-s for proper nouns).
   - Possessive pronominals are expressed as enclitics or suffixes, indicating possession but not adding to the core case system.

4. **Paragraph 33**:
   - Provides examples of sentences with ergative and absolutive markers.
   - The enclitic -da attaches to the verb when it precedes an ergative, and -t enclitic attaches to the temporal designation.
   - This reinforces the presence of ergative and absolutive cases.

5. **Paragraph 43**:
   - When an absolutive pronominal occurs in a sentence with a noun ergative, a -t enclitic must be attached to the temporal designation.
   - This further supports the ergative-absolutive distinction.

### Reasoning:

The information provided consistently highlights the presence of ergative and absolutive cases, which are used to mark subjects of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs/direct objects of transitive verbs, respectively. There is no mention of additional morphological cases such as dative, genitive, instrumental, or locative that would expand the case system beyond these two core cases.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abkhaz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abkhaz, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the ""predicative case in -s"" and its use in various constructions.
2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of the predicative case in conjunction with interrogative pronouns.
3. **Paragraph 6** mentions the predicative case in -s and its use with reflexive possessive adjectives.
4. **Paragraph 7** discusses the predicative case and its alternative form in -na.
5. **Paragraph 17** mentions the predicative case used with quantified nouns.
6. **Paragraph 21** discusses the predicative case-form ending in -n.
7. **Paragraph 36** mentions the use of the predicative case in various contexts.
8. **Paragraph 38** discusses the use of the predicative case in plural formations.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Abkhaz has a productive case paradigm involving the predicative case. However, there is no mention of other cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, instrumental, etc., which are typically found in languages with more extensive case systems.

Given the information, it appears that Abkhaz primarily uses a single productive case form, the predicative case, which is used in various syntactic and semantic contexts. There is no evidence of a more extensive case system with multiple distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",2 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Armenian (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Eastern Armenian, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions that nouns have five case forms: Nominative (NOM), Dative (DAT), Ablative (ABL), Instrumental (INST), and Locative (LOC).
2. **Paragraph 4** provides further details on the endings for each case:
   - NOM has a zero ending (unmarked).
   - DAT ends in various suffixes depending on the declension type.
   - ABL ends in {-ic}.
   - INST ends in {-ov}.
   - LOC ends in {-um}.

These paragraphs clearly outline a productive case system with five distinct morphological cases for nouns in Eastern Armenian.

Hunzib,"Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Hunzib, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system described.

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions several syntactic cases: nominative, ergative, genitive, instrumental, and dative. It also refers to location and direction, which implies the presence of locative cases.

2. **Paragraph 4** describes the formation of oblique stems and mentions that oblique case endings include ergative, genitive, instrumental, and local endings. It specifies that there are seven local endings, which can be followed by directional suffixes like elative and translative.

3. **Paragraph 5** confirms the presence of nominative and oblique cases for adjectives and mentions that adjectives can be fully inflected with the usual case endings.

4. **Paragraph 7** lists various oblique markers and mentions the formation of oblique singular and plural stems, indicating a productive case system.

5. **Paragraph 11** provides examples of case forms, including the allative, which is used to indicate direction.

6. **Paragraph 19** lists several case endings, including nominative, genitive, ergative, instrumental, and mentions the use of local endings like superessive, subessive, and contactive.

7. **Paragraph 25** details the use of the nominative, ergative, instrumental, and genitive cases, and provides examples of their usage.

8. **Paragraph 31** lists seven local endings: dative, adessive, superessive, subessive, contactive, comitative, and allative.

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following cases in Hunzib:
- Nominative

The grammar descriptions and examples provided indicate that Hunzib has a rich and productive case system with at least 11 distinct cases, including both core syntactic cases (like nominative and ergative) and various local cases (like superessive and allative).

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kayah Li (Eastern),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kayah Li (Eastern), we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the relevant morphological structures and their functions.

1. **Paragraph 6** explicitly states: ""There is no marking of nouns for case, number or gender."" This indicates that Kayah Li does not use morphological case-marking for nouns.

2. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Kayah Li phenomena should not be assumed to be identical to those in familiar languages like English, suggesting that traditional grammatical categories might not apply directly.

3. **Paragraph 5** and **Paragraph 6** further reinforce the lack of inflectional morphology, stating that there is no inflection of verbs for tense, person-number agreement, voice, or anything else, and that the language lacks inflectional morphology of any kind.

4. **Paragraph 6** also mentions that the language uses prepositions and localizers to express relationships typically marked by cases in other languages, such as locative expressions.

5. **Paragraph 11** discusses locative expressions and embedded clauses functioning as locatives, further indicating that spatial and relational functions are handled by prepositions and localizers rather than case endings.

6. **Paragraph 49** discusses the use of prepositions and localizers in various syntactic roles, including as objects and topics, which are functions that might be marked by cases in other languages.

Given these points, it is clear that Kayah Li (Eastern) does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies on word order, prepositions, and localizers to convey these relationships.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Khanty,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Khanty (Ostyak), we can analyze the case system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that personal pronouns inflect for case and have a paradigm that includes three cases: Nominative, Accusative-Dative, and Locative.
2. **Paragraph 7** explicitly states that the case system includes the unmarked Nominative, the Locative in -na, and the Translative.
3. **Paragraph 16** indicates that the morphology of eastern Ostyak possesses a more complicated system of case marking (about 10-11 cases) compared to northern dialects which have 3 or 4 cases.
4. **Paragraph 9** mentions that the case marking for lexical NPs can be characterized as neutral, lacking an overt Accusative marker.
5. **Paragraph 5** discusses postpositions and their agreement patterns, which might suggest additional locative or instrumental-like functions but does not explicitly add to the core case system.

From these points, it is clear that Khanty (Ostyak) has a basic system of at least three core cases: Nominative, Accusative-Dative, and Locative. Additionally, the Translative is mentioned, making it four core cases. However, the mention of 10-11 cases in the eastern dialects suggests a more complex system that includes additional cases beyond these core ones.

### Conclusion:
**10 or more cases**

This conclusion is based on the explicit mention of a more complex case system in the eastern dialects of Khanty, which includes about 10-11 cases.",3 cases,10 or more cases
Korean,"### Reasoning:

- **Dative**
- **Locative (Static and Dynamic)**
- **Source**
- **Goal**
- **Instrumental**
- **Ablative**
- **Directional**
- **Comitative**

This gives us a total of more than 10 productive cases.

### Conclusion:
10 or more cases",6-7 cases,10 or more cases
Latvian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Latvian, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 2** explicitly states that traditionally, Latvian grammars have worked with a system of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, instrumental, accusative, locative, and vocative. However, the status of the instrumental case is questioned because it occurs only with the preposition ""ar"" (with) and is identical in form with the accusative in the singular and the dative in the plural. The conclusion drawn in this paragraph is that modern Latvian does not have a separate instrumental case, leading to a system of six cases.

2. **Paragraph 6** mentions the syntactic functions of the oblique cases in Latvian, which include all cases except the nominative and the vocative. This further supports the existence of six cases.

3. **Paragraph 21** indicates that the functions of the cases will be described in the following order: genitive, accusative, dative, locative, nominative, and vocative, which aligns with the six-case system described in Paragraph 2.

4. **Paragraph 12** discusses the nominative case and its functions, reinforcing its role as one of the six cases.

5. **Paragraph 17** mentions the nominative case in the context of grammatical subjects, further confirming its inclusion in the case system.

6. **Paragraph 25** discusses the adnominal dative, providing examples of its use, which supports the presence of the dative case.

7. **Paragraph 35** discusses the genitive case, particularly in negative constructions, supporting its presence in the case system.

8. **Paragraph 44** discusses the adverbal accusative, confirming the accusative case's role in Latvian.

9. **Paragraph 39** mentions the locative case in the context of ordinal numbers and dates, confirming its presence.

10. **Paragraph 28** discusses possessive pronouns, some of which are genitive forms of personal pronouns, further supporting the genitive case's role.

Given the consistent references to these six cases and the explicit exclusion of the instrumental as a separate case in modern Latvian, we can conclude that Latvian has a system of six productive cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",5 cases,6-7 cases

Meithei,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meithei, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - The table shows the inflectional paradigm of 'ηιιρά' (male child) with the following case markers:
     - Agentive/Instrumental: -na
     - Accusative: -pu
     - Locative: -ta
     - Ablative: -tegi
     - Genitive: -ki
     - Associative: -ka

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - There is a discussion about the agentive -na and the contrastive marker -nd, but it is clarified that -nd is not a case marker.

3. **Paragraph 14**:
   - Case markers for peripheral noun phrases include:
     - Locative: -ta
     - Instrumental: -na
     - Associative: -ka
     - Ablative: -tagi

4. **Paragraph 17**:
   - The genitive case is indicated by -ki, and it can be further marked by locative or associative markers.

5. **Paragraph 23**:
   - Clausal subordinators derived from case markers include:
     - Associative: -ka
     - Genitive: -ki
     - Locative: -ta
     - Ablative: -tagi
     - Instrumental: -na

From these paragraphs, we can identify the following productive case markers in Meithei:

- **Agentive/Instrumental**: -na
- **Accusative**: -pu
- **Locative**: -ta
- **Ablative**: -tegi / -tagi
- **Genitive**: -ki
- **Associative**: -ka

This gives us a total of six distinct cases. The presence of these markers indicates that Meithei has a productive case system with six cases.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Mundari,"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Mundari. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions case markers indicating syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions, but does not specify the number of cases.
2. **Paragraph 3** states that Mundari is not an inflectional language and that both the subject and object are morphologically unmarked for case. It also mentions the use of postpositions for expressing functions like the instrumental.
3. **Paragraph 11** mentions that the instrumental is expressed by the postposition ""te"" following a noun or pronoun.
4. **Paragraph 14** lists several postpositions used for expressing locative functions: ""re"" (in), ""te"" (to), ""ate/ete"" (from), ""sa?"" (on the side), ""ta?"" (vicinity), ""lo?"" (with), and ""ko"" (approximate).
5. **Paragraph 15** discusses the possessive suffix ""-rea?/ra?"" for animate and inanimate nouns.
6. **Paragraph 25** mentions the use of postpositions for expressing location in time.
7. **Paragraph 39** discusses the use of postpositions in forming postpositional phrases as adjuncts.

From these points, it is clear that Mundari uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate various grammatical relationships. The language relies on postpositions for expressing functions typically associated with cases in other languages, such as locative, instrumental, and possessive functions.

Given this information, Mundari does not have a productive case paradigm of nouns in the traditional sense but instead uses postpositions to express these relationships. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete (or peripheral, or semantic) case relations.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Nivkh,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the case markers and their functions.

1. **Paragraph 1** lists several case markers including nominative, dative/accusative, comparative, locative, locative/ablative, dative/additive, limitative, and instrumental. This suggests a rich case system.
2. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that there are 8 cases in one dialect (AD) and 7 cases in another (ESD). This confirms the presence of a significant number of cases.
3. **Paragraph 4** mentions that all plural personal pronouns have the same case system as nouns, indicating that the case system is productive and applies broadly across different types of nouns and pronouns.
4. **Paragraph 24** describes specific uses of cases such as the locative, which indicates a place of action, possessor, or time of action.
5. **Paragraph 23** provides examples of the dative/accusative case being used to express cause in causative constructions and as a subject in indirect speech, further illustrating the functional range of the case system.

Given the evidence from these paragraphs, it is clear that Nivkh has a productive and extensive case system that includes at least 7-8 distinct cases.

### Conclusion:
8-9 cases",8-9 cases,8-9 cases
Tati (Southern),"### Reasoning:

1. **Direct and Oblique Cases**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions the use of direct and oblique cases in Southern Tati dialects, with specific functions assigned to each. The direct case is used for subjects, vocatives, agents in most dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions. The oblique case is used for genitives, agents in some dialects, some verb objects, and objects of some postpositions.
   - Paragraph 5 reiterates the retention of an oblique case in nouns and pronouns, indicating a productive case system.
   - Paragraph 21 explicitly states that Eshtehardi has a clear system of two cases: direct and oblique.

2. **Examples and Usage**:
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 14 provide examples of postpositions that create case-like forms, but these are not considered genuine case endings.
   - Paragraph 24 and Paragraph 46 illustrate the use of the direct case for subjects and vocatives and the oblique case for genitives in Chali, reinforcing the two-case system.
   - Paragraph 48 confirms that in Chali, the agent is expressed in the oblique case, further supporting the presence of a two-case system.

3. **General Remarks**:
   - Paragraph 33 discusses the general agreement among dialects in distinguishing direct and oblique cases, with some variation in plural endings.
   - Paragraph 41 mentions that both numbers (singular and plural) generally distinguish a direct and an oblique case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, Southern Tati exhibits a productive case system with two cases: direct and oblique.

**Conclusion: 2 cases**",2 cases,2 cases

Urdu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urdu, the following observations can be made:

1. **Nominative Case**: This is the default case used for the subject of a sentence. It is mentioned multiple times across the paragraphs, indicating its presence and usage in Urdu.
   
2. **Oblique Case**: This case is used when a noun or pronoun is followed by a postposition. It is frequently mentioned in the context of various postpositions such as ""ko"", ""ka"", ""méth"", ""sé"", etc. The oblique case is also used with ergative postpositions like ""né"".

3. **Vocative Case**: This case is used for directly addressing someone or something. It is mentioned explicitly in the context of nouns and pronouns.

4. **Dative Case (as interpreted by some grammarians)**: There is a mention of objects marked by ""ko"" being treated as in the dative case by some grammarians. However, this is not universally accepted and is considered a grammatical postposition by others.

5. **Ergative Case (as interpreted by some grammarians)**: Similarly, subjects marked by ""né"" are considered to be in the ergative case by some grammarians, but this is also treated as a postposition by others.

Given these observations, the productive case paradigms of nouns in Urdu include:
- Nominative
- Oblique
- Vocative

The mentions of dative and ergative cases are based on the interpretation of postpositions as case markers, which is not universally accepted. Therefore, they are not considered separate productive cases in the traditional sense.

**Reasoning**: Urdu has three primary cases: nominative, oblique, and vocative. The dative and ergative interpretations are based on postpositions, which are not universally accepted as true case markers.

**Conclusion**: 3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided excerpts from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can determine the number of productive cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Core Cases**:
   - The language has a Nominative case for subjects (S) and agents (A), and an Accusative case for objects (O). The Accusative case is used under specific conditions, such as when the agent is third person (Paragraph 1).
   - The Predicative case is used for focus marking and can be applied to S and O participants (Paragraph 1).
   - The Instrumental case can also mark the patient (O) under certain conditions (Paragraph 1).

2. **Case Paradigm**:
   - The case paradigm includes Nominative, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ablative, Prolative, and Comitative (Paragraph 7).
   - Personal pronouns are inflected for these cases, with some minor differences (Paragraph 2).

3. **Examples and Functions**:
   - The grammar provides examples and functions for each case, showing their usage in various syntactic roles (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

4. **Productive Cases**:
   - The language has a productive system of case marking for nouns, including Nominative, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ablative, Prolative, and Comitative (Paragraph 7).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Yukaghir (Kolyma) has a productive case system with **10 or more cases**. This includes Nominative, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ablative, Prolative, and Comitative, among others.

**Conclusion: 10 or more cases**",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã offer detailed insights into the language's morphological structure, particularly focusing on noun phrases and the use of various markers. Here is a summary of the key points relevant to determining the number of cases in Apurinã:

1. **Oblique Markers**:
   - The language uses oblique markers to indicate peripheral grammatical relations, such as associative, instrumental, locative, and goal markers (e.g., -kata, -ã, -mokaru).
   - These markers attach to the last word of a noun phrase and have a semantic scope over the entire noun phrase.

2. **Possession**:
   - Apurinã distinguishes between possessed and unpossessed forms of nouns, with specific markers for each (e.g., -te, -ne, -re1, -re2 for possessed forms and -txi for unpossessed forms).
   - Possession markers are lexically determined and do not function as cases but rather as markers of possession.

3. **Subject and Object Markers**:
   - The language uses pronominal markers to indicate subjects and objects, which are in complementary distribution with coreferential free nominal expressions.
   - These markers are not considered cases but rather pronominal agreement markers.

4. **Special Bound Formatives**:
   - Apurinã has a set of special bound formatives that can attach to nouns, verbs, and other word classes, including perfective and imperfective markers, predicate markers, and focus markers.
   - These formatives do not function as cases but rather as aspectual or syntactic markers.

5. **Relative Clauses**:
   - The language uses relative pronominal markers to form relative clauses, which can indicate the role of the head noun within the clause.
   - These markers are not cases but rather relativizers.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Apurinã does not have a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or genitive. Instead, it uses a combination of pronominal markers, possession markers, and oblique markers to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles. The oblique markers, which indicate peripheral relations like associative, instrumental, and locative, suggest that the language employs a system of borderline case-marking for these specific functions.

**Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awa Pit,"### Reasoning:

1. **Postpositions and Case Marking**:
   - Awa Pit uses postpositions extensively to mark grammatical relations, as seen in Paragraphs 3, 7, and 11. The language does not have a case-suffix system for nouns, relying instead on postpositions to indicate relationships between noun phrases and verbs.
   - The accusative marker ""ta"" is used to indicate the object or second object, as discussed in Paragraphs 3, 11, and 17. This marker behaves like a postposition rather than a suffix, which is a significant indicator that Awa Pit does not have a traditional case system but uses postpositions to fulfill similar functions.

2. **Special Pronoun Forms**:
   - Paragraphs 2, 8, and 9 mention special accusative forms for personal pronouns, which are treated as suffixes rather than clitics. This indicates a limited use of morphological case marking specifically for pronouns, but not for nouns in general.

3. **Core and Oblique Functions**:
   - Paragraph 6 distinguishes between core and oblique functions, with core functions corresponding to syntactic cases and oblique functions to semantic cases. However, this distinction is made in the context of syntactic roles rather than morphological case marking.

4. **Nominal Modifiers and Possession**:
   - Paragraphs 5, 23, and 31 discuss possessive constructions and the use of possessive adjectives and postpositions to indicate possession. This further supports the idea that Awa Pit uses postpositions rather than morphological case markers for nouns.

5. **Nominative-Accusative Alignment**:
   - Paragraphs 11 and 21 confirm that Awa Pit follows a nominative-accusative alignment, with subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbs being treated similarly and objects being marked differently. However, this marking is achieved through postpositions rather than inflectional case endings.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The evidence points to Awa Pit not having a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to indicate grammatical relations, with limited morphological case marking restricted to personal pronouns.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Barasano,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barasano, we can identify the following productive case markers:

1. **-re**: This morpheme is used to mark objects, experiencers, benefactees, and manner.
2. **-réka**: This morpheme marks accompaniment and instrument.
3. **-h#**: This morpheme marks locations or times.
4. **-ya**: This morpheme marks the genitive case.

These markers are used to indicate various syntactic and semantic roles of noun phrases within sentences. The presence of these four distinct morphemes suggests that Barasano has a productive case system with four cases.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Epena Pedee,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Epena Pedee, we can determine the number of cases in the language by identifying the productive case paradigms of nouns. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Ergative Case**: The ergative case is marked by the suffixes -pa and -a. The ergative case marks the subject of a transitive clause (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 22, 23, 26, 27, 38, 39, 41).

2. **Absolutive Case**: The absolutive case is not overtly marked. It is the default case for the subject of an intransitive clause and the object of a transitive clause (Paragraphs 2, 3, 10, 11, 14, 22, 23, 26, 27).

3. **Dative Case**: The dative case is marked by -maa, -mda, -a, or vowel lengthening and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase. It indicates the recipient or goal in bitransitive clauses and verbs of motion (Paragraphs 2, 4, 7, 12, 19, 23, 37).

4. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is marked by the clitic -pa, which is also used to mark the ergative case (Paragraphs 2, 4, 24).

5. **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by -ma, -de, -da, indicating location (Paragraphs 2, 4, 7, 19, 23, 24, 37).

6. **Benefactive Case**: The benefactive case is marked by -it'ée, indicating the participant for whom the action is performed (Paragraphs 4, 37).

7. **Comparative Case**: The comparative case is marked by -ra, indicating comparison (Paragraphs 2, 26, 31, 39).

8. **Possessive Case**: The possessive case is marked by -de, indicating possession (Paragraphs 2, 19, 24, 37, 50).

From the above information, we can conclude that Epena Pedee has a productive case system with at least the following cases: ergative, absolutive, dative, instrumental, locative, benefactive, comparative, and possessive.

### Conclusion:
6-7 cases",10 or more cases,6-7 cases
Hixkaryana,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hixkaryana, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information extracted:

1. **Paragraph 2** mentions the use of postpositional phrases governed by the instrumental relator ""ke"" and other postpositions indicating various semantic roles such as material, cause, and purpose. This suggests that Hixkaryana uses postpositions rather than case inflections to mark these relations.

2. **Paragraph 13** discusses the expression of subjects and objects in verbs, indicating that nominal subjects are optional and take the same form as subjects of intransitive verbs. This implies that there is no distinct morphological case marking for subjects and objects.

3. **Paragraph 16** describes derived nominals and their syntactic behavior, mentioning that subjects of underlying transitives surface as postpositional phrases with the noun followed by ""wya"" (normally an indirect object marker). This further supports the use of postpositions rather than case inflections.

4. **Paragraph 24** explicitly states that instrumental is expressed by the relator ""ke"" and source by ""hoye,"" indicating the use of postpositions for these functions.

5. **Paragraph 30** provides examples of adverbial phrases and postpositional particles, reinforcing the idea that Hixkaryana uses postpositions to express various syntactic and semantic relationships rather than morphological case markers.

6. **Paragraph 36** discusses the use of postpositional phrases and particles for expressing different grammatical relations, further confirming the reliance on postpositions.

7. **Paragraph 41** mentions specific sets of postpositional relators for expressing inferior-contact and other spatial relations, again indicating the use of postpositions instead of case inflections.

8. **Paragraph 44** describes the use of derivational processes for negation and nominalization, but does not mention any case inflections.

From these observations, it is clear that Hixkaryana does not use morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, it relies on postpositions to express syntactic and semantic relationships.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Paumarí,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Paumarí, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Ergative Case**: The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the enclitic -a 'ERG' (Paragraphs 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).
2. **Objective Case**: The object is marked by the enclitic -ra 'OBJ' (Paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).
3. **Oblique Case**: The enclitic -a 'OBL' is used for various oblique functions, including locations and other peripheral relations (Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

These three cases (ergative, objective, and oblique) are consistently marked and productive in the language. There is no evidence of additional productive case paradigms beyond these three.

**Conclusion: 3 cases**",3 cases,3 cases
Pirahã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pirahã, we can analyze the case-marking system as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that word order is the principal marker of grammatical relations in Pirahã. However, it also states that there are morphological markers for oblique relations, specifically mentioning the instrumental case marked by `-oal-ai` and the locative/general oblique case marked by `-o`. This indicates that Pirahã has at least two distinct morphological cases: instrumental and locative/oblique.

2. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph reiterates that oblique case is generally shown by the suffix `-o`. It also mentions that verbs do not treat indirect objects differently from other oblique objects, suggesting that the oblique case marking is quite general and not highly differentiated.

3. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph provides examples of locative case marking with the suffix `-o` and mentions the possibility of double occurrence of this suffix within postpositional phrases. This reinforces the presence of locative case marking.

4. **Paragraph 34**: This paragraph discusses the use of the suffix `-sai` as a nominalizer but does not introduce any new case markers.

5. **Paragraph 1** (continued): The paragraph also mentions that the principal marker of grammatical relations is word order, and no affix has been observed to mark participants or grammatical relations in subordinate clauses, further emphasizing the limited use of morphological case marking.

From the information provided, it is clear that Pirahã has morphological markers for at least two cases: instrumental and locative/oblique. There is no evidence of a more extensive case system beyond these two cases.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,2 cases
Quechua (Imbabura),"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imbabura Quechua, we can identify the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case markers on nouns and their functions. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Accusative Case (-ta):**
   - Used to mark direct objects (e.g., ""Marya-ta"" in ""Marya-ta juya-ni"" - 'I love Maria').
   - Can also be used for objects of comparison and other functions (e.g., ""Fransisku ka Juzi-shna jatun mi ka-rka"" - 'Francisco was as big as José').

2. **Dative Case (-man):**
   - Used to mark indirect objects (e.g., ""Ruza-man ni-rka-ni"" - 'I told Rosa').
   - Obligatory for indirect objects in Imbabura Quechua.

3. **Locative Case (-pi):**
   - Used to indicate location (e.g., ""wasi-pi"" - 'in the house').

4. **Ablative Case (-manda):**
   - Used to indicate source or origin (e.g., ""Kitu-manda shamu-ni"" - 'I come from Quito').

5. **Allative Case (-man):**
   - Used to indicate direction towards (e.g., ""Utavalu-man ri-ju-ni"" - 'I am going to Otavalo').

6. **Instrumental Case (-wan):**
   - Used to indicate the means or instrument (e.g., ""Marya-wan tushu-rka-ni"" - 'I danced with Maria').

7. **Benefactive Case (-paj):**
   - Used to indicate the beneficiary (e.g., ""Marya-paj fishta-ta rura-rka"" - 'José made a party for Maria').

8. **Limitative Case (-lla):**
   - Used to indicate limitation (e.g., ""Marya-ta-lla juya-ni"" - 'I love only Maria').

9. **Comparative Case (-shna):**
   - Used to indicate comparison (e.g., ""Fransisku ka Juzi-shna jatun mi ka-rka"" - 'Francisco was as big as José').

These cases are productive and used to mark various syntactic and semantic relationships in noun phrases. The presence of these distinct and productive case markers indicates that Imbabura Quechua has a robust case system.

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",8-9 cases,10 or more cases
Sanuma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sanuma, we can identify the following case markers:

1. **Ergative Marker (-nd)**: This marker is used to indicate the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses, functioning as an ergative marker. It is also used for superordinate subjects in stative, intransitive, and semitransitive clauses.
2. **Instrumental Marker (-nd)**: The same marker (-nd) is also used to mark instruments in certain contexts.
3. **Goal/Locative Marker (niha/ha)**: These markers indicate a goal or locative function in various types of clauses, including motion clauses and ditransitive clauses.
4. **Agent Marker (-nd)**: This marker is used in experience clauses to mark the agent, which is the participant experiencing an emotion or perception.

From the analysis, it is clear that Sanuma has a productive case-marking system with at least three distinct cases: ergative, instrumental, and locative/goal. The ergative marker is used for subjects in transitive clauses, the instrumental marker for instruments, and the locative/goal markers for indicating goals or locations.

### Reasoning:
- **Ergative Case**: The marker -nd is used to mark the subject in transitive and ditransitive clauses, functioning as an ergative marker.
- **Instrumental Case**: The same marker -nd is used to indicate instruments in certain contexts.
- **Locative/Goal Case**: The markers niha/ha are used to indicate goals or locations in various types of clauses.

### Conclusion:
3 cases",2 cases,3 cases
Shipibo-Konibo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Shipibo-Konibo, we can determine the number of cases in the language by examining the morphological case-marking system described.

1. **Ergative-Absolutive System**:
   - The language exhibits an ergative-absolutive pattern, where the ergative case is marked overtly, and the absolutive case is marked by zero (Paragraph 1). The ergative morpheme {-n} has multiple allomorphs and is used to mark ergative, genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal functions.

2. **Case Functions**:
   - The ergative morpheme is used for multiple functions:
     - Ergative
     - Genitive
     - Instrumental
     - Locative-Directional
     - Temporal
   - There are alternative ways to mark locative-directional and temporal functions, and zero marking is used for recipients or goals (Paragraph 1).

3. **Examples of Case Usage**:
   - Examples provided show the ergative morpheme {-nin} being used for ergative, genitive, and oblique functions (Paragraph 1).
   - The language also uses zero marking for absolutive cases, which is evident in the examples where objects and subjects of intransitive verbs are marked with zero (Paragraph 1).

4. **Additional Case Markers**:
   - The language has a benefactive applicative suffix -xon, which can be added to both intransitive and transitive verbs, indicating a benefactive or malefactive function (Paragraph 29).
   - The associative applicative -kin ~ -kiin and the malefactive applicative -(V)naan ~ (V)n are also used, with the latter being restricted to transitive verbs (Paragraph 29).

5. **Summary of Case Markers**:
   - Ergative: {-n} (with multiple allomorphs)
   - Absolutive: Zero marking
   - Genitive: {-n}
   - Instrumental: {-n}
   - Locative-Directional: {-n} (with alternatives)
   - Temporal: {-n} (with alternatives)
   - Benefactive: -xon
   - Associative: -kin ~ -kiin
   - Malefactive: -(V)naan ~ (V)n

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Shipibo-Konibo has a productive case system with at least six distinct cases: ergative, absolutive, genitive, instrumental, locative-directional, and temporal, with additional applicative markers for benefactive, associative, and malefactive functions. Therefore, the number of cases in Shipibo-Konibo falls into the category of **6-7 cases**.

**Conclusion: 6-7 cases**",6-7 cases,6-7 cases
Trumai,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the number of cases in Trumai by examining the morphological case-marking system described. Here are the key points:

1. **Case Markers**:
   - Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 14 list the case markers in Trumai: Ergative (-ak /-ek /-k), Dative (-atl /-etl / -tl, -ki, -as /-es /-s), Locative (-an/-en/-n), and Genitive (-kate/-kte).
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 10 further elaborate on the Dative markers, indicating that there are multiple Dative markers depending on the semantic characteristics of the NP.

2. **Types of Arguments**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4 state that Trumai has an Ergative-Absolutive alignment and identifies three main argument types: Absolutive, Ergative, and Dative.
   - Paragraph 16 and Paragraph 20 discuss the alignment and the argument types in more detail, emphasizing the distinction between core arguments (Absolutive, Ergative, Dative) and peripheral arguments.

3. **Productivity and Usage**:
   - Paragraph 29 and Paragraph 40 indicate that the case-marking of arguments required by a Trumai verb is rigid and cannot be changed, suggesting a productive and consistent use of these case markers.

4. **Borderline Case-Marking**:
   - Paragraph 12 mentions postpositions like Ablative, Instrumental, Comitative, and Allative, which are distinct from the core case markers and are used to mark more peripheral relations.

### Conclusion: 4 cases

The analysis of the provided paragraphs indicates that Trumai has a productive case-marking system with four primary cases: Ergative, Absolutive, Dative, and Locative. The presence of multiple Dative markers does not increase the number of distinct cases but rather shows variation within the Dative case. The Genitive is also mentioned but seems to be used in possessive constructions rather than as a core grammatical case. Peripheral markers like Ablative, Instrumental, and Comitative are treated separately and do not count towards the core case system.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",5 cases,4 cases
Urubú-Kaapor,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the language Urubú-Kaapor exhibits the following characteristics relevant to case marking:

1. **Object Marker ""ke""**: The suffix ""ke"" is used to mark the object in transitive clauses when two nominals occur. This is explicitly mentioned in multiple paragraphs, indicating that ""ke"" functions as an object marker (Paragraphs 1, 3, 19).

2. **Possessive Constructions**: Possession is expressed using possessive pronouns and nominal phrases. There is no mention of a genitive case marker, but possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession (Paragraph 4).

3. **Postpositional Phrases**: There are examples of postpositional phrases, such as ""a'erehe"" (for, to) and ""rupi"" (through, along), but these are not considered cases in the traditional sense as they are not inflectional markers on the noun itself (Paragraphs 3, 24).

4. **Lack of Other Case Markers**: There is no evidence of additional case markers for roles such as nominative, dative, instrumental, locative, etc. The only morphological marker that could be considered a case marker is ""ke"" for the object.

Given these observations, Urubú-Kaapor does not have a fully developed case system with multiple cases. Instead, it has a single productive case marker for the object, and other relationships are expressed through possessive pronouns and postpositions.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Warao,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can analyze the case-marking system of the language. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that Warao uses suffixes to mark case, with examples like ""totira-si"" (woman-DAT) for ""my wife"" and ""dani-mo"" (father-ABL) for ""from his/her father"".
2. **Paragraph 2** lists specific case markers: DAT (dative), LOC (locative), ALL (allative), and ABL (ablative). It also states that these cases are used mostly for peripheral constituents like indirect objects and adjuncts.
3. **Paragraph 4** discusses the dative case in more detail, mentioning suffixes like ""-(i)si"", ""-ta"", and ""-ima"" for different dative functions.
4. **Paragraph 6** provides examples of demonstratives and pronouns inflected for dative and ablative cases.
5. **Paragraph 10** reiterates the use of dative markers ""-ma"", ""-(i)si"", and ""-to"" for beneficiaries.
6. **Paragraph 12** gives examples of locative and allative cases in sentences.
7. **Paragraph 21** provides examples of locative and ablative cases in use, such as ""hanoko-ira-no"" (house-LOC) and ""ururu-ira-no"" (creek-ABL).
8. **Paragraph 32** mentions the comitative case expressed by the postposition ""kaika"" (with someone).

From the information provided, Warao has the following productive case markers:
- **Dative**: ""-(i)si"", ""-ta"", ""-ima""
- **Locative**: ""-no"", ""-te""
- **Allative**: ""-ya""
- **Ablative**: ""-mo""
- **Comitative**: ""kaika"" (postposition)

These cases are used to mark peripheral relations such as indirect objects, locations, and sources, but there is no mention of core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative being marked morphologically.

### Reasoning:
The case markers identified in Warao are primarily for peripheral or semantic relations (dative, locative, allative, ablative, comitative). There is no evidence of morphological case-marking for core syntactic relations (subject, direct object). This fits the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the language has overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",5 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in the language:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Explicitly states, ""There is no case marking in the language.""
2. **Paragraph 2**: Reiterates, ""since there is no case marking, it does not govern case.""
3. **Paragraph 4**: Confirms, ""There is no case marking in the language.""
4. **Paragraph 6**: States, ""There is no double case marking in the language.""
5. **Paragraph 9**: Mentions, ""Nonpronominal nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or gender.""
6. **Paragraph 18**: Indicates, ""there are no other ways, other than in kinship terms (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), for directly marking noun functions on the noun.""
7. **Paragraph 42**: States, ""There is no instrumental case.""

These statements consistently indicate that Wari' does not employ morphological case marking on nouns. The absence of case marking is explicitly mentioned multiple times, and no evidence is provided to suggest the presence of any productive case paradigms.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, we can analyze the presence and productivity of case-marking in the language. Here are the key points:

1. **Genitives**:
   - Genitive phrases (possessors) precede the head noun (possessed item). There is no mention of a specific genitive case marker, but rather the use of possessive constructions involving clitics (Paragraph 1).

2. **Postpositions**:
   - Yagua is a postpositional language with a significant number of postpositions (upwards of thirty). These include adlative, ablative, dative, and locative postpositions (Paragraph 2). These postpositions are used to indicate various oblique roles and are suffixed to nouns or nominalized clauses.

3. **Participant Reference Clitics**:
   - The language uses Set I and Set II clitics to mark subjects, objects, and possessors. These clitics are prefixed or suffixed to verbs, nouns, and postpositions (Paragraphs 6, 10, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 29, 34, 43, 48, 49, 50).

4. **Nominal Modifiers**:
   - Demonstratives, numerals, and other modifiers show agreement with the head noun through classifiers, but there is no explicit mention of case markers for these roles (Paragraphs 22, 23, 27, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41).

5. **Incorporation and Nominalizations**:
   - The language exhibits incorporation of nouns into verbs and uses nominalizations extensively. However, these processes do not indicate a productive case system but rather derivational morphology (Paragraphs 3, 18, 24, 28, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38).

6. **Absence of Morphological Case-Marking**:
   - There is no evidence of a productive morphological case system for marking core syntactic roles (such as nominative, accusative, etc.). Instead, syntactic roles are indicated through word order, clitics, and postpositions.

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**

The evidence suggests that Yagua does not have a productive case system for marking core syntactic roles but uses postpositions for marking oblique roles. Therefore, the language fits the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can analyze the case-marking system in Hup to determine the number of productive cases. Here are the key points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - Hup has a case system that marks both core and oblique arguments.
   - Subjects are unmarked.
   - Objects are marked with the suffix -a‡n, depending on animacy and definiteness.
   - Oblique arguments are marked with the suffix -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and with -an for locative and allative/ablative roles.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - Hup employs morphological case marking.
   - Differential object case marking and differential plural marking are sensitive to an animacy hierarchy.

3. **Paragraph 15**:
   - Oblique case -Vêt is used for various non-core participants in the clause.
   - The oblique marker is always required where applicable and is not dependent on animacy, definiteness, or number.

4. **Paragraph 24**:
   - The oblique case -Vêt indicates locative, instrumental, and comitative roles.

5. **Paragraph 37**:
   - Case marking in Hup is not limited to individual nominal words but also occurs on noun phrases and relative clauses.

From these points, we can identify the following productive cases in Hup:

- **Nominative**: Unmarked for subjects.
- **Accusative**: Marked with -a‡n for objects, depending on animacy and definiteness.
- **Oblique**: Marked with -Vêt for instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and with -an for locative and allative/ablative roles.

Thus, Hup has three productive cases:
1. **Nominative** (unmarked)
2. **Accusative** (-a‡n)
3. **Oblique** (-Vêt, -an)

### Conclusion:
3 cases",4 cases,3 cases
Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can determine the number of cases in the language by analyzing the information about the case-marking system.

1. **Paragraph 1** (315):
   - Murui has a nominative-accusative case marking system.
   - Core arguments can be marked for nominative (S/A), accusative (O), and locative/dative.
   - There are five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

2. **Paragraph 2** (316):
   - Table 6.3 lists the core and oblique cases.
   - Core cases: nominative (S/A), accusative (O), and dative/locative.
   - Oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

3. **Paragraph 5** (117):
   - Confirms the presence of the same cases mentioned earlier: topical S/A, non-S/A markers, locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

4. **Paragraph 6** (1.1):
   - Mentions the nominative-accusative alignment and the presence of dependent marking (case).

5. **Paragraph 7** (273):
   - Table 6.1 provides a summary of grammatical relations and core case argument marking.
   - Confirms the nominative (S/A), accusative (O), and dative/locative cases.

6. **Paragraph 12** (299):
   - Table 6.2 lists the oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.

7. **Paragraph 13** (5.1):
   - Discusses possessive constructions and mentions the genitive marker -ɨe.

8. **Paragraph 18** (292):
   - Mentions the differential object marking and the use of the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Huitoto (Murui) has a total of 8 cases:
- Core cases: nominative, accusative, dative/locative.
- Oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative.
- Additionally, there is a genitive marker, which is considered a case as it does not encode categories of the possessum like number or gender and does not show explicit adjective-like properties.

Thus, the total number of cases in Huitoto (Murui) is 8-9 cases.

**Conclusion: 8-9 cases**",6-7 cases,8-9 cases
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Iquito. The paragraphs discuss various aspects of the language, such as word order, pronouns, tense, aspect, and derivational morphology, but they do not provide evidence of a morphological case-marking system for nouns.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention any specific case markers or suffixes that would indicate a productive case system for nouns.
   - There is a focus on word order and cliticization, which suggests that syntactic relationships might be expressed through word order rather than morphological case marking.
   - The discussion of pronouns and their positions in sentences does not imply the presence of case markers but rather the use of resumptive pronouns and clitics.
   - The detailed descriptions of verbal morphology and tense-aspect systems do not include any reference to nominal case marking.

Conclusion: **No morphological case-marking**",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can determine the number of cases in the language as follows:

1. **Paragraph 1**: It explicitly states that Movima has no case marking and no agreement indicating grammatical relations. This is a crucial point indicating the absence of morphological case-marking in the language.

2. **Paragraph 4**: It mentions that there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). However, this is the only case marking mentioned, and it is not sufficient to establish a productive case paradigm.

3. **Paragraph 7**: It discusses the hierarchical alignment system and the differentiation of arguments through cliticization, not case marking. This further supports the absence of a productive case system.

4. **Paragraph 6**: It mentions that grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in which the argument is cliticized to the base, not by case marking.

5. **Paragraph 9**: It refers to the oblique case marker n- but does not provide evidence of a productive case system beyond this single marker.

6. **Paragraph 10**: It discusses the structure of the language and mentions the use of cliticization and other morphological processes but does not indicate a productive case system.

7. **Paragraph 11**: It mentions the use of oblique marking in certain constructions but does not provide evidence of multiple productive cases.

Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the case-marking system in Apinayé. Here are the key points:

1. **Ergative Case-Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions an ergative case-marking system conditioned by subordination environments. This indicates that Apinayé uses ergative marking in certain syntactic contexts, specifically in subordinate clauses.
   - Paragraph 9 further elaborates on this, stating that the ergative case marker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause in relative clauses.

2. **Dative Case-Marking**:
   - Paragraph 1 also mentions that the third argument in traditional ditransitive predicates bears the dative case-marking. Additionally, noncanonical verb types have second arguments that bear one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb.
   - Paragraph 7 discusses verbs that require a dative A (agent) for verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear, and desire.

3. **Instrumental and Other Case-Markers**:
   - Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 6 mention the use of various postpositions, including instrumental and locative, which are used to mark arguments that deviate from the standard patterns of argument marking.
   - Paragraph 27 discusses reflexivization involving postpositions, indicating that these postpositions can be marked for person and can take relational prefixes.

4. **Genitive Case-Marking**:
   - Paragraph 33 describes genitive constructions, where alienable nouns involve a genitive postposition õ, which requires a relational prefix.

5. **Nonfinite Forms and Case-Marking**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 12 mention that subordination in Apinayé requires nonfinite verb forms, and the ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument depending on coreference conditions.

6. **Relational Prefixes**:
   - Paragraph 38 and Paragraph 39 discuss relational prefixes, which serve as linkers between a root and some element that immediately attaches to it, indicating constituency between a head and a dependent element.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Apinayé exhibits a system of case-marking that includes ergative, dative, instrumental, and genitive cases. The presence of these multiple case markers suggests that Apinayé has a productive case paradigm with at least four distinct cases.

**Conclusion: 4 cases**",no morphological case-marking,4 cases
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kakua, we can determine the number of cases in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1 (Chapter 6 Introduction)**:
   - Kakua marks object arguments with case morphology.
   - Object arguments and adjuncts receive case marking.
   - Table 6.1 lists the case markers: 
     - Object (direct and indirect): =diʔ
     - Locative: =bǔ
     - Instrumental/Comitative: =hiʔ̃́
     - Terminative: pɨ (preposition)

2. **Paragraph 2 (Chapter 3 Overview)**:
   - Kakua nominal categories include case marking.
   - The language has a combination of head and dependent marking.

3. **Paragraph 3 (Chapter 11 Alignment and Word Order)**:
   - Object arguments are marked with the case marker =diʔ.
   - Subject arguments are not marked by case but are indexed on the verb.

4. **Paragraph 4 (Chapter 6 Object Marking)**:
   - Object marking is obligatory for certain noun phrases based on animacy and definiteness.
   - Object case marker =diʔ is used for various semantic roles including patients, themes, recipients, beneficiaries, and maleficiaries.

5. **Paragraph 5 (Chapter 6 Case Marking on Adjuncts)**:
   - Adjuncts are marked with specific case markers: 
     - Locative: =bǔ
     - Instrumental/Comitative: =hiʔ̃́
     - Terminative: pɨ (preposition)

6. **Paragraph 6 (Chapter 6 Summary)**:
   - The object case marker =diʔ serves to mark NPs functioning as object arguments in several different semantic roles.
   - The alignment of object arguments corresponds to a neutral type of object alignment, where P=T=R.

7. **Paragraph 7 (Chapter 6 Case Markers for Adjuncts)**:
   - Case markers for adjuncts include locative, comitative/instrumental, and terminative.

8. **Paragraph 8 (Chapter 6 Object Marking on Personal Pronouns)**:
   - Personal pronouns are obligatorily marked with object case when functioning as objects.

9. **Paragraph 9 (Chapter 6 Object Marking on Nouns Referring to Animals)**:
   - Nouns referring to animals are optionally marked for object case based on animacy hierarchy.

10. **Paragraph 10 (Chapter 6 Object Marking on Nouns Referring to Mythological Beings)**:
    - Mythological beings and deities are treated like humans and are obligatorily marked for object case when functioning as objects.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Kakua has a system of case marking that includes at least four distinct cases:
- Object (direct and indirect): =diʔ
- Locative: =bǔ
- Instrumental/Comitative: =hiʔ̃́
- Terminative: pɨ (preposition)

Therefore, the number of cases in Kakua is best described as **4 cases**.

### Conclusion:
4 cases",4 cases,4 cases
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

1. **Postpositional Enclitics**: The language Yuracare uses postpositional enclitics to mark case relations. These enclitics attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase and mark peripheral relations such as comitative, instrument, location, direction, and ablative. This is evident from Paragraph 1, which states: ""Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location, direction and ablative.""

2. **Peripheral Relations**: The postpositions marking case relations in Yuracare are used for more peripheral relations, which include comitative, instrument, location, direction, and ablative. This is further supported by Paragraph 5, which lists the postpositional markers: ""=tina (comitative), =la (instrument), =y (locative), =chi (direction), =jsha (ablative).""

3. **Classification as Adpositions**: These markers are considered postpositions rather than case markers because they mark non-central participants and are phrasal enclitics, attaching to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. Paragraph 5 explains this distinction: ""The markers in (41) mark non‐central (non‐obligatory) participants; therefore they are on the adpositional side of Payne’s continuum.""

4. **No Central Case Marking**: The language does not have central case marking for core grammatical relations like nominative, accusative, or genitive. Instead, it uses postpositional enclitics for peripheral relations, which are more characteristic of adpositions than of a full-fledged case system.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that Yuracare uses postpositional enclitics to mark peripheral relations and does not have a central case marking system for core grammatical relations, it falls under the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

### Conclusion:
**Exclusively borderline case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can identify several case markers that are used productively in the language. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Locative Case**: The locative case is marked by the suffix -ok for inanimate nouns and -bi-ok for animate nouns. Examples include ""yebn-ok"" (in the house) and ""bobonts-bi-oka"" (at the house of the young man).

2. **Ablative Case**: The ablative case is marked by the suffix -okan, which appears to be a composite of the locative -ok with an additional element -an. Examples include ""tj-okan"" (from the mountain) and ""bata-bi-okan"" (from my aunt).

3. **Allative Case**: The allative case is marked by the suffix -oy for inanimate nouns and -bi-oy for animate nouns. Examples include ""tjoy"" (to the mountain) and ""bata-bi-oy"" (to my aunt).

4. **Benefactive Case**: The benefactive case is marked by the suffix -am for inanimate nouns and -bi-am for animate nouns. Examples include ""shknen-am"" (for the plate) and ""bata-bi-am"" (for my aunt).

5. **Instrumental Case**: The instrumental case is marked by the suffix -ak, with allomorphs -k and -ek depending on the phonological environment. Examples include ""s̈knen-ak"" (with the plate) and ""tamo-k"" (with salt).

6. **Comitative Case**: The comitative case is marked by the suffix -abtak, which is used for animate nouns. Examples include ""kes̈-abtak"" (with the dog) and ""bata-btak"" (with my aunt).

7. **Genitive Case**: The genitive case is marked by the suffix -be, which is used to indicate possession. Examples include ""bata-be"" (aunt's) and ""Carmen-be"" (Carmen's).

8. **Adessive Case**: The adessive case is marked by the suffix -ents̈e, which indicates location at a place. Examples include ""taban-ents̈e"" (in the town) and ""kanÿ-ents̈e"" (in one place).

9. **Illative Case**: The illative case is marked by the suffix -iñ, which indicates motion into something. An example is ""kwashaj-iñ"" (into the gourd).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Camsá has a productive case system with at least nine distinct cases. Therefore, the number of cases in Camsá is best categorized as:

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kadiwéu, the language exhibits a system of semantic role markers that function similarly to what might be considered case markers in other languages. However, these markers are not used with nouns but rather with pronominal clitics and affixes. This suggests that Kadiwéu does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Here are the key points from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Indicates that subjects are in the nominative case and objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.
2. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that pronominal affixes or clitics co-occur with several different semantic case markers.
3. **Paragraph 8**: Lists semantic role markers such as -d: ‘theme’, -gi ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -k ‘allative’, and -lokom ‘adessive’.
4. **Paragraph 11**: States that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic case morphology.
5. **Paragraph 21**: Reiterates that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements that assign semantic roles, and nouns never co-occur with such semantic role assigners.
6. **Paragraph 22**: Confirms that Kadiwéu lacks prepositions and structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional phrases are actually serial verb constructions.

From these points, it is clear that Kadiwéu uses semantic role markers with pronominal clitics and affixes, but not with nouns. This indicates that Kadiwéu does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it uses what could be considered borderline case-marking for pronominals.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking

Baure,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Baure, the following points are relevant to determining the number of cases in Baure:

1. **Locative Case**: The grammar mentions the use of a locative suffix ""-ye"" to mark locations (e.g., ""mesi-ye"" for ""on the table""). This is a clear indication of a locative case.

2. **Absence of Core Cases**: The text explicitly states that there are no core cases in Baure, as semantic roles are generally marked on the verb (head-marking). This implies that there are no nominative, accusative, or dative cases.

3. **Possession**: Possession is marked by personal proclitics on the noun that is possessed (head-marking), and not by a genitive case.

4. **Peripheral Case**: The text mentions a ""peripheral case (locative)"" and suggests that specific locations are derived by compounds of nouns with locative noun roots.

5. **No Core Cases**: The grammar emphasizes that there are no core cases in Baure, reinforcing the idea that the language relies on other means (such as verb marking) to indicate grammatical relations.

6. **Other Morphemes**: The text lists other morphemes frequently attached to nouns, such as diminutive, augmentative, distributive, and emphatic, but these do not constitute additional cases.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided, Baure has a single productive case paradigm, which is the locative case. There are no core cases (nominative, accusative, dative), and possession is marked by proclitics rather than a genitive case. Therefore, Baure fits the description of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the only overt marking is for a concrete (or peripheral) case relation, such as the locative.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
