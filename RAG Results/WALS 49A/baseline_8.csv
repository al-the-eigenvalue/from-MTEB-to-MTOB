Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia, exhibits a relatively simple case system compared to many other languages. In Amharic, nouns are marked for case primarily through the use of suffixes, but the system is not extensive.

Amharic has a nominative case, which is the default form of the noun used for subjects of sentences. The accusative case is marked by the suffix ""-n"" and is used for direct objects. There is also a genitive case, which is marked by the suffix ""-ə"" or ""-i"" depending on the noun's ending, and it indicates possession.

In addition to these, Amharic has a dative case, which is marked by the suffix ""-nna"" and is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb. There are also locative and instrumental cases, but these are often expressed through prepositions rather than morphological case marking on the noun itself.

Given this information, Amharic can be said to have a productive case system with four primary cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. The locative and instrumental functions are typically handled by prepositions, which do not count towards the productive case paradigm of nouns.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases
Beja,"Beja, a Cushitic language spoken primarily in Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt, exhibits a relatively simple case system. The language primarily distinguishes between two cases: the nominative and the accusative. These cases are used to mark the subject and the direct object of a sentence, respectively. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Nominative Case:** This case is used for the subject of a sentence. For example, in a sentence like ""The man sees the boy,"" ""the man"" would be in the nominative case.
   - **Accusative Case:** This case is used for the direct object of a sentence. In the same example, ""the boy"" would be in the accusative case.
   
   The distinction between these two cases is productive and is a fundamental part of the grammatical structure of Beja. There are no additional cases for other grammatical functions such as dative, genitive, or locative, which are often found in languages with more complex case systems.

Conclusion: 2 cases",2 cases,2 cases

Iraqw,"Iraqw is a Cushitic language spoken in Tanzania. In terms of its grammatical structure, Iraqw exhibits a system of case marking that is somewhat limited and does not align with the extensive case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, Iraqw primarily uses prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships rather than relying heavily on inflectional case marking.

The language has been analyzed to have a minimal case system, with some sources suggesting the presence of nominative and accusative cases, but these are not marked through extensive morphological changes on the nouns themselves. Instead, the distinctions are often made through syntactic means and the use of particles.

Given this information, Iraqw does not have a robust system of productive case paradigms for nouns that would fit into the higher categories of case numbers. Instead, it fits into the category of having ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where the marking is minimal and often pertains to more peripheral relations rather than a full-fledged case system.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda, a Bantu language spoken in Rwanda, does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on a combination of prepositions, noun class prefixes, and verb conjugations to indicate grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case markings. 

In Bantu languages, noun classes play a significant role in the grammatical structure, and Kinyarwanda is no exception. These noun classes are marked by prefixes that attach to nouns and adjectives, and they govern agreement with verbs and other parts of speech. However, these prefixes do not function as cases in the traditional sense, as they do not mark the grammatical roles of nouns (such as subject, object, or indirect object) directly.

Instead, Kinyarwanda uses prepositions to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and possession. For example, the preposition ""ku"" can mean ""to"" or ""at,"" and ""na"" can mean ""with"" or ""and."" These prepositions are used in combination with noun class prefixes to convey meanings that might be expressed through cases in other languages.

Given this information, Kinyarwanda does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

1. **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking**: Inanwatan does not use inflectional morphology to mark grammatical cases on nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their syntactic roles (such as subject, object, etc.).
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: Instead of morphological case-marking, Inanwatan employs syntactic strategies such as word order and the use of particles to convey grammatical relationships.
3. **Typological Context**: Many languages in the Papuan region share this feature, relying more on syntactic means rather than morphological case-marking to indicate grammatical functions.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abui,"Abui, a Papuan language spoken in Indonesia, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on marking peripheral or concrete relations rather than core grammatical relations like subject or object. The language uses postpositions to mark various locative and instrumental relations, but it does not have a productive case system for marking core grammatical relations on nouns themselves.

Given this information, Abui does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on postpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. This aligns with the definition of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" where overt marking is only for concrete or peripheral relations.

### Reasoning:
1. Abui uses postpositions rather than inflectional case markers to indicate locative and instrumental relations.
2. There is no evidence of a productive case system marking core grammatical relations such as nominative, accusative, or genitive directly on nouns.
3. The marking system in Abui fits the description of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking,"" as it only marks peripheral relations like locatives and instrumentals.

### Conclusion:
Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Awtuw,"Awtuw, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. In Awtuw, there are two primary cases that are marked morphologically: the nominative and the accusative. These cases are used to indicate the subject and the direct object of a verb, respectively. The nominative case is typically unmarked, while the accusative case is marked with a suffix.

1. **Reasoning**:
   - The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence and is usually unmarked.
   - The accusative case is used for the direct object and is marked with a specific suffix.
   - There are no additional productive case paradigms for other grammatical functions such as dative, genitive, or locative within the core noun system.
   - The marking of these two cases is consistent and productive, fitting the definition of grammatical case provided.

Conclusion: 2 cases",5 cases,2 cases
Mpur,"Mpur, also known as Amberbaken, is a language spoken in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Papua, Indonesia. It is part of the East Bird's Head language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Mpur, particularly its case system, we need to consider how it marks grammatical relations on nouns.

Mpur does not have a productive case system in the sense of having a set of morphological markers that indicate different grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to convey these relationships. This is typical of many languages in the region, which often use other strategies rather than morphological case marking to indicate grammatical relations.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Mpur regarding the number of cases is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mehek,"Mehek, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, exhibits a system of case marking that is not highly developed in terms of syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, or dative. Instead, Mehek primarily uses postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This type of marking is more characteristic of peripheral or semantic relations rather than core grammatical functions.

Given this information, Mehek does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on postpositions to convey meanings that other languages might express through cases.

### Reasoning:
1. Mehek does not have a system of morphological case-marking for core grammatical functions (such as nominative, accusative, or dative).
2. The language uses postpositions to indicate relationships, which aligns more with peripheral or semantic case relations.
3. There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm that would suggest the presence of multiple cases.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Abun,"Abun, a language spoken in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Papua, is known for its lack of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead of using morphological case-marking, Abun relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations. This characteristic aligns with the typological feature of ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Linguistic Documentation**: Studies and linguistic descriptions of Abun indicate that the language does not employ morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated through word order and prepositional phrases.
2. **Absence of Case Affixes**: There are no affixes or inflections attached to nouns in Abun that would denote different grammatical cases, such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
3. **Alternative Strategies**: Abun uses alternative strategies like prepositions and fixed word order to convey relationships between nouns and verbs, which is a common feature in languages without morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koasati,"Koasati, a Muskogean language spoken by the Coushatta people in Louisiana and Texas, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, Koasati relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. While there are some affixes that can indicate locative or instrumental relations, these are not part of a broader, productive case system that applies to all nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Koasati does not have a comprehensive system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
   - The language uses word order and other syntactic strategies rather than inflectional morphology to indicate grammatical roles.
   - Any markers that do exist are limited and do not form a productive paradigm applicable to all nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Maricopa,"Maricopa, a Yuman language spoken in Arizona, exhibits a system of case marking that is relatively limited. The language primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relations rather than a rich inflectional case system. However, it does have some morphological case marking, particularly for marking subjects and objects.

Maricopa has been analyzed to have the following cases:
1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Genitive (possessive)

Given this information, Maricopa can be classified as having 3 cases.

**Reasoning:**
Maricopa uses morphological markers to distinguish between the subject (nominative), the direct object (accusative), and possessive relationships (genitive). This limited set of cases fits the definition of having productive case paradigms for nouns, but it does not extend to a larger number of cases.

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",6-7 cases,3 cases
Miwok (Southern Sierra),"The Southern Sierra Miwok language, part of the Miwok language family, exhibits a system of case marking that is somewhat limited and does not align with the extensive case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, Southern Sierra Miwok primarily uses postpositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships, rather than a rich inflectional case system.

In Southern Sierra Miwok, there is no productive case paradigm for nouns that would classify it under the categories of having multiple cases (such as 2 cases, 3 cases, etc.). Instead, the language relies on other grammatical mechanisms to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Southern Sierra Miwok in terms of case marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking

4. **Dative**: Used for the indirect object of a sentence.
5. **Locative**: Used to indicate location.

These cases are marked morphologically on nouns, making the case system productive and integral to the grammar of Nez Perce. Given this information, Nez Perce has a total of 5 cases.

**Reasoning**: The presence of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative cases in Nez Perce indicates a productive case-marking system with five distinct cases.

Conclusion: 5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is a language of the Iroquoian family, primarily spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. In terms of its grammatical structure, Oneida does not utilize a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology to convey grammatical relationships and roles that would typically be marked by cases in other languages. The language uses a combination of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes on verbs to indicate subject, object, and other grammatical relations, rather than marking these relations on the nouns themselves.

Given this information, Oneida falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" because it does not have a system of noun cases that mark grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"The Southeastern Pomo language, part of the Pomoan language family spoken in Northern California, is known for its complex morphological structure. However, when it comes to case marking, Southeastern Pomo does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that many other languages with rich case systems do. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships.

In Southeastern Pomo, there is no extensive system of morphological case marking that applies broadly across nouns to indicate their grammatical roles such as subject, object, etc. While there may be some markers for specific relational or locative functions, these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of productive case paradigms.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Southeastern Pomo regarding the number of cases is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Slave,"Slave, also known as Dene or Slavey, is an Athabaskan language spoken in Canada. Athabaskan languages are known for their complex verb morphology and relatively simple noun morphology. In the case of Slave, the language does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.

Slave uses postpositions to indicate relationships that in other languages might be marked by cases. For example, instead of having a dative case, Slave would use a postposition to indicate the indirect object of a verb. This reliance on postpositions rather than inflectional case marking is characteristic of the language.

Given this information, Slave does not have a productive case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wichita,"Wichita is a Caddoan language that was historically spoken by the Wichita people in Oklahoma. One of the notable features of Wichita is its lack of morphological case-marking on nouns. Instead of using case markers to indicate grammatical relations, Wichita relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to convey syntactic roles and relationships.

In Wichita, the syntactic functions that would typically be marked by cases in other languages are instead indicated through the structure of the sentence and the use of verb affixes. For example, subject and object roles are determined by their position relative to the verb and by specific verb forms rather than by changes to the noun itself.

Given this information, Wichita does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns, and thus falls into the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Wintu, a Native American language of Northern California, is known for its rich morphological system, including its use of case marking. In Wintu, nouns are marked for case to indicate their grammatical roles within sentences. The language has a productive case system that includes several distinct cases.

This absence of a productive case paradigm aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Aleut,"Aleut, a language of the Eskimo-Aleut family, exhibits a case system that is relatively complex. Aleut nouns are marked for case, and the language uses a variety of cases to indicate different grammatical functions and relationships.

Aleut has the following productive cases:
1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Locative
5. Ablative

These cases are used to mark the subject, direct object, possession, location, and source or separation, respectively. Given this information, Aleut has a total of 5 productive cases.

**Reasoning:**
Aleut employs a nominative-accusative alignment in its case marking, distinguishing between subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs (nominative) and direct objects (accusative). The genitive case marks possession, while the locative and ablative cases indicate location and source, respectively. These cases are morphologically marked and are productive in the language, meaning they are regularly used and form a systematic part of the grammar.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",2 cases,5 cases
Chumash (Barbareño),"Chumash, specifically the Barbareño dialect, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and other syntactic mechanisms to convey grammatical relationships. The language uses a combination of word order, verb morphology, and particles to indicate the roles of nouns within sentences, but it does not have a system of morphological case-marking where nouns change form to indicate their grammatical function.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Chumash languages, including Barbareño, are known for their polysynthetic nature, where much of the grammatical information is encoded in the verb rather than in the noun.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm for nouns in Barbareño Chumash. Instead, the language uses other strategies such as verb affixes and particles to indicate grammatical relations.
   - The absence of morphological case-marking aligns with the typological characteristics of many Native American languages, which often employ other means to convey syntactic roles.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Comanche,"Comanche is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Comanche people in the United States. In terms of its morphological structure, Comanche is known for its polysynthetic nature, which means it tends to use complex words made up of many morphemes. However, when it comes to case marking, Comanche does not have a productive case system for nouns similar to languages like Latin or Russian.

Instead, Comanche relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. The language uses postpositions rather than inflectional case endings to express relationships such as location, direction, and instrumentality. This means that Comanche does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Comanche in terms of case marking is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",3 cases,no morphological case-marking
Kiowa,"Kiowa, a Tanoan language spoken by the Kiowa people in Oklahoma, exhibits a system of case marking that is somewhat limited and does not align with the more extensive case systems found in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, Kiowa primarily uses word order and verb agreement to indicate grammatical relations. 

In Kiowa, there is no extensive system of morphological case marking on nouns. The language relies more on syntactic means (such as word order) and verbal morphology to convey grammatical relationships. While there might be some markers for specific roles or relations, they do not constitute a productive case paradigm as seen in languages with multiple cases.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Kiowa in terms of case marking is:

**Conclusion: No morphological case-marking**",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Tlingit,"Tlingit is a Na-Dené language spoken by the Tlingit people in Alaska and Canada. In Tlingit, the concept of grammatical case as found in many Indo-European languages is not present. Instead, Tlingit relies heavily on a combination of word order, verb morphology, and postpositions to convey grammatical relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Tlingit does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it uses postpositions to indicate relationships such as location, direction, and possession. For example, the possessive relationship is indicated by a possessive prefix on the noun rather than a genitive case ending.
   - **Verb Morphology:** Tlingit verbs are highly inflected and carry much of the grammatical information that might be conveyed by cases in other languages. This includes subject and object agreement, aspect, mood, and other verbal categories.
   - **Word Order:** Tlingit employs a relatively fixed word order (SOV - Subject-Object-Verb) to indicate grammatical relationships, which further reduces the need for case marking.

Given these characteristics, Tlingit does not use morphological case-marking for its nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet,"Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is an Algonquian language spoken by the Passamaquoddy and Maliseet peoples in the northeastern United States and Canada. Algonquian languages, including Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, typically do not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, these languages often use a combination of word order, verb morphology, and prepositions or postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

In Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, the primary means of indicating grammatical relations is through verb morphology, which includes complex agreement systems that mark subjects, objects, and other participants. Additionally, prepositions or postpositions may be used to indicate locative or instrumental relations, but these do not constitute a productive case system in the sense of having distinct morphological case paradigms for nouns.

Given this information, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet does not have a productive case system for nouns.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Basque,"Basque is a language isolate spoken in the Basque Country, which straddles the border between Spain and France. It is known for its rich case system, which is used to mark various grammatical relationships within sentences. 

In Basque, nouns can take a variety of case endings to indicate their role in the sentence. These cases include, but are not limited to, the nominative, genitive, dative, ergative, instrumental, comitative, and several locative cases. The exact number of cases can vary slightly depending on the analysis, but it is generally agreed that Basque has a productive case system with more than ten distinct cases.

The primary cases in Basque include:
- Nominative (unmarked)
- Ergative
- Absolutive
- Genitive
- Dative
- Instrumental
- Comitative
- Locative (several forms, including inessive, allative, ablative, etc.)

Given this extensive system, Basque clearly falls into the category of languages with ""10 or more cases.""

**Conclusion:** 10 or more cases",10 or more cases,10 or more cases
Catalan,"Catalan, a Romance language spoken primarily in Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and parts of France and Italy, does not have a productive case system for nouns. Like other Romance languages, Catalan relies on prepositions and word order to indicate the grammatical relationships between nouns in a sentence. 

In Catalan, the roles that might be marked by cases in other languages are instead indicated by prepositions (e.g., ""de"" for genitive, ""a"" for dative) and syntactic position. This is consistent with the typological characteristics of Romance languages, which generally lack morphological case-marking on nouns.

### Reasoning:
1. Catalan nouns do not inflect for case.
2. Grammatical relationships are indicated through prepositions and word order.
3. This aligns with the general typological pattern of Romance languages.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, also known simply as Frisian, is a West Germanic language spoken in the Netherlands. In terms of its grammatical structure, Frisian has largely lost its case system, similar to the development seen in English. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but in contemporary usage, it does not employ productive case paradigms for nouns.

Kayah Li (Eastern),"Kayah Li (Eastern) is a member of the Karenic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. In examining the grammatical structure of Kayah Li, particularly its nominal morphology, it becomes evident that the language does not utilize a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relations within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Morphological Analysis:** Kayah Li does not exhibit inflectional morphology that marks nouns for different grammatical cases. There are no suffixes, prefixes, or other morphological markers that change the form of a noun to indicate its syntactic role (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - **Syntactic Structure:** The language primarily uses word order to convey grammatical relationships. For example, the subject typically precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb.
   - **Prepositional Usage:** Instead of case markers, Kayah Li employs prepositions to express relationships that other languages might indicate through cases. For instance, locative and instrumental relations are conveyed through prepositions rather than through morphological changes to the noun.
   - **Linguistic Research:** Studies and descriptions of Kayah Li grammar, such as those found in linguistic surveys and typological databases, consistently report the absence of a case-marking system.

Given this information, it is clear that Kayah Li (Eastern) does not have a productive case-marking system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Iquito,"Iquito is a highly endangered Zaparoan language spoken in Peru. In terms of its grammatical structure, Iquito does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences. This lack of morphological case-marking is characteristic of many languages in the Amazonian region.

1. Reasoning:
   - Iquito does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns.
   - Syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are indicated through word order and other grammatical means rather than through inflectional case endings.
   - The language does not have a productive paradigm of cases that would classify it under any of the specific numerical case categories.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Movima,"Movima is a language spoken in Bolivia, and it is known for its unique typological features. One of the notable aspects of Movima is its lack of morphological case-marking. Instead of using case markers to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence, Movima relies on word order and other syntactic strategies.

### Reasoning:
1. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: Movima does not have a system of productive case paradigms for nouns. The language does not use suffixes, prefixes, or infixes to mark cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive. Instead, grammatical relationships are indicated through word order and other syntactic means.
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: Movima employs a variety of syntactic strategies to convey grammatical relationships. For example, it uses specific word orders to distinguish between subjects and objects. Additionally, it may use particles or other functional words to indicate roles that would be marked by cases in other languages.
3. **Typological Classification**: In the context of linguistic typology, Movima is classified as a language with no morphological case-marking. This classification is based on the absence of a productive system of case markers that modify nouns to indicate their grammatical roles.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Apinayé,"The Apinayé language, which is part of the Jê language family spoken in Brazil, does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, Apinayé relies on other grammatical means such as word order and postpositions to indicate syntactic and semantic relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This characteristic aligns with the typological feature of ""No morphological case-marking.""

1. **Reasoning**:
   - Apinayé does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. Instead, the language uses other strategies, such as word order and postpositions, to convey grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a productive case paradigm in Apinayé that marks nouns for different grammatical cases like nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
   - The language does not have overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations, which would otherwise qualify it for ""Exclusively borderline case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Cacua,"Cacua, a language spoken by the Cacua people in Colombia, is part of the Tucanoan language family. Tucanoan languages are generally known for their complex morphosyntactic structures, but they do not typically employ extensive case-marking systems. Instead, these languages often rely on other grammatical mechanisms such as word order, verb morphology, and postpositions to indicate grammatical relations.

In the specific case of Cacua, the language does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it uses other strategies to mark grammatical relations, such as verb agreement and postpositional phrases. This aligns with the general typological characteristics of many South American indigenous languages, which tend to have limited or no morphological case-marking.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Cacua regarding the number of cases is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",4 cases,no morphological case-marking
Yuracare,"Yuracare is a language spoken in Bolivia, and it is known for its complex morphological structure. However, when it comes to case marking, Yuracare does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns in the same way that languages with extensive case systems (like Russian or Finnish) do.

Instead, Yuracare relies more on other grammatical strategies such as word order and verb agreement to indicate grammatical relations. The language does have some markers that could be considered as encoding locative or instrumental relations, but these do not form a comprehensive or productive case system.

Given this information, Yuracare fits best into the category of ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This is because it has some overt marking for concrete or peripheral case relations but does not have a fully developed case system for marking syntactic roles like nominative, accusative, or dative.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking
Camsá,"The Camsá language, spoken by the Camsá people in Colombia, is known for its complex agglutinative structure. However, it does not exhibit a productive case system for nouns in the way that many Indo-European or Uralic languages do. Instead, Camsá relies more on word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence.

Given this information, Camsá does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. It does not mark nouns for case in the way that languages with nominative-accusative or ergative-absolutive systems do. Instead, it uses other grammatical strategies to convey the relationships between words.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphological structure. However, it does not employ a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns. Instead, Kadiwéu relies on other means such as word order and adpositions to indicate syntactic roles and relationships between nouns.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Kadiwéu does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. 
   - The language uses other strategies, such as word order and adpositions, to convey grammatical relationships.
   - There is no evidence of a system of morphological case-marking that categorizes nouns into different cases based on their syntactic or semantic roles.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Karajá,"Karajá is a language spoken by the Karajá people in Brazil. It belongs to the Macro-Jê language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Karajá does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and other syntactic means to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Karajá does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns. The language does not use inflections or suffixes to indicate different grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, grammatical relationships are typically expressed through word order, context, and other syntactic strategies.
   - **Typological Characteristics:** Many languages in the Macro-Jê family, including Karajá, tend to lack extensive case-marking systems. They often use other means, such as postpositions or word order, to convey grammatical relationships.
   - **Linguistic Descriptions:** Descriptions of Karajá grammar do not mention a productive case system. Instead, they focus on other aspects of the language's syntax and morphology, such as verb conjugation and the use of particles.

2. **Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",10 or more cases,no morphological case-marking
Baure,"Baure is an Arawakan language spoken in Bolivia. In the context of grammatical case, Baure does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships. This characteristic aligns with the option ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: Baure does not have a set of morphological case markers that are applied to nouns to indicate their grammatical roles. Instead, syntactic relationships are primarily indicated through word order and the use of prepositions.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: As an Arawakan language, Baure shares this feature with many other languages in the family, which typically do not employ extensive case-marking systems.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Baure grammar do not mention productive case paradigms for nouns, further supporting the conclusion that it lacks morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
