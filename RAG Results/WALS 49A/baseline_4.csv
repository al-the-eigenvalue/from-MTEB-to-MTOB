Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia, exhibits a relatively limited case system compared to some other languages. In Amharic, the primary case distinction is between the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is typically unmarked, while the accusative case is marked by the suffix ""-n"" (e.g., ""wänd"" for ""boy"" in the nominative and ""wänd-n"" for ""boy"" in the accusative). 

Additionally, Amharic has a genitive construction, but it is not marked by a specific case suffix on the noun itself. Instead, possession is indicated through a construct state or possessive suffixes attached to the possessed noun. This does not constitute a separate genitive case in the traditional sense of morphological case-marking.

Given this information, Amharic does not have a rich case system with multiple productive case paradigms for nouns. Instead, it primarily relies on a nominative-accusative distinction with some possessive constructions that do not fit the strict definition of morphological case-marking.

Berber (Middle Atlas),"The Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Berber, generally do not have a rich system of morphological case-marking. Instead, they rely more on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. In Middle Atlas Berber, there is a distinction between the ""free state"" and the ""construct state"" of nouns, which can be considered a minimal case system. However, this distinction is quite limited and does not constitute a full-fledged case system as seen in languages with multiple productive cases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Middle Atlas Berber primarily uses the ""free state"" and ""construct state"" to mark grammatical relations, which is a very minimal form of case marking.
   - There is no extensive system of morphological case-marking for various syntactic roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc.
   - The language relies more on syntactic structures and prepositions rather than a productive case paradigm.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking

Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda is a Bantu language spoken primarily in Rwanda. Bantu languages are generally known for their rich noun class systems rather than for having extensive case systems. In Kinyarwanda, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and possessive are typically indicated through word order and agreement markers rather than through a system of morphological case marking on nouns.

In Kinyarwanda, the primary means of indicating grammatical relationships are through:

1. **Noun Classes and Agreement**: Kinyarwanda has a complex system of noun classes, and agreement markers on verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech align with these noun classes.
2. **Prepositions**: Certain relational meanings (like locatives or instrumentals) are expressed through prepositions rather than case endings.
3. **Word Order**: The language relies heavily on word order to indicate grammatical roles, such as subject and object.

Given these characteristics, Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns in the sense of inflectional case marking. Instead, it uses other grammatical mechanisms to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Turkana,"Turkana, a Nilotic language spoken in Kenya, exhibits a system of case marking that is primarily focused on marking peripheral or semantic relations rather than core grammatical relations like nominative or accusative. In Turkana, there are specific markers for locative and instrumental cases, but there is no extensive system of morphological case marking for core grammatical relations such as subject or object.

The locative case in Turkana is used to indicate location, and the instrumental case is used to indicate the means by which an action is performed. These cases are marked by specific suffixes attached to the noun. However, Turkana does not have a productive case paradigm that includes a wide range of grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive, which are typically found in languages with rich case systems.

Given this information, Turkana falls under the category of languages that have overt marking only for concrete or peripheral case relations, such as locatives or instrumentals, without a broader system of grammatical case marking.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Yoruba,"Yoruba is a language spoken predominantly in Nigeria and belongs to the Niger-Congo language family. It is an analytic language, meaning it relies more on word order and function words rather than inflectional morphology to convey grammatical relationships. In Yoruba, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and possession are typically indicated through word order and prepositions rather than through morphological case marking on nouns.

For example:
- Subject: ""Ọmọkùnrin náà ń jẹun"" (The boy is eating)
- Object: ""Mo rí ọmọkùnrin náà"" (I saw the boy)
- Possession: ""Bàbá ọmọkùnrin náà"" (The boy's father)

In these examples, the relationships between the nouns and their grammatical functions are indicated by their position in the sentence and the use of prepositions, not by changes in the form of the nouns themselves.

Given this information, Yoruba does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies on syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical relationships.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Unfortunately, there is limited information available about the Seme language in the provided context. However, based on the general typological patterns and the classification of languages with similar characteristics, we can make an educated guess.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** This option is for languages that do not use any morphological markers to indicate grammatical relations on nouns. If Seme uses word order or prepositions exclusively to indicate grammatical relations, this would be the appropriate category.
   - **2 Cases:** This would typically include a nominative-accusative or ergative-absolutive distinction. If Seme has a minimal case system distinguishing only the subject and object, this might be the case.
   - **3 Cases:** This usually includes nominative, accusative, and genitive or another similar set. If Seme has a slightly more complex system, this could be the case.
   - **4 Cases:** This might include nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative or another similar set.
   - **5 Cases:** This would include a more complex system with additional cases like instrumental or locative.
   - **6-7 Cases:** This would indicate a fairly rich case system with several distinct grammatical relations marked.
   - **8-9 Cases:** This would indicate a very rich case system with numerous distinctions.
   - **10 or More Cases:** This would indicate an extremely rich case system with many distinctions.
   - **Exclusively Borderline Case-Marking:** This would apply if Seme only marks peripheral or semantic relations like locatives or instrumentals without marking core grammatical relations like subject or object.

Given the lack of specific information about Seme, we need to rely on general typological tendencies. Many languages with limited documentation and smaller speaker populations tend to have simpler case systems or rely on other means like word order or prepositions.

2. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the general typological tendencies and the absence of specific information, it is reasonable to conclude that Seme likely has ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Koyra Chiini,"Koyra Chiini, also known as Western Songhay, is a language spoken primarily in Mali. It belongs to the Songhay language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Koyra Chiini does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

This characteristic aligns with the typological feature of ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. **Lack of Case Paradigms**: Karo Batak does not have distinct morphological markers that change the form of nouns to indicate different grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.
2. **Use of Prepositions**: The language uses prepositions to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For example, possession, location, and other relationships are indicated through prepositions rather than inflectional changes to the noun.
3. **Word Order**: Karo Batak relies on a relatively fixed word order to convey syntactic roles, which is a common feature in languages without morphological case-marking.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Chamorro,"Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. Chamorro primarily distinguishes between two cases: the absolutive and the ergative.

1. **Absolutive Case**: This case is used for the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb.
2. **Ergative Case**: This case is used for the subject of a transitive verb.

These two cases are part of an ergative-absolutive alignment system, which is different from the more familiar nominative-accusative alignment found in languages like English. In addition to these primary cases, Chamorro also has prepositions that can indicate other relationships, but these do not constitute additional productive case paradigms for nouns.

Given this information, Chamorro has a productive case system with two cases.

Dani (Lower Grand Valley),"The Dani language, specifically the Lower Grand Valley dialect, is known for its relatively simple morphological structure compared to languages with extensive case systems. In the context of grammatical case, Dani does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies more on word order and other syntactic means to convey grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case marking.

### Reasoning:
1. **Morphological Simplicity**: Dani lacks the complex inflectional morphology that characterizes languages with multiple grammatical cases. There are no distinct morphological markers that indicate different cases for nouns.
2. **Syntactic Strategies**: Instead of using case markers, Dani employs word order and other syntactic strategies to indicate grammatical roles such as subject, object, and indirect object.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Dani grammar by linguists such as Karl Heider and others do not mention the presence of a case system. They emphasize the use of word order and context to understand the roles of nouns in sentences.

Given these points, it is clear that Dani does not utilize morphological case-marking for its nouns.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
Hamtai,"Hamtai, also known as Kapau, is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Trans-New Guinea language family. In examining the case system of Hamtai, it is important to consider the nature and number of productive case paradigms that are used to mark nouns.

Hamtai does not exhibit a rich case-marking system typical of languages with extensive nominal inflection. Instead, it primarily uses postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships, which is a common feature in many Papuan languages. These postpositions serve to mark roles such as location, direction, and other semantic relationships rather than syntactic functions like subject or object.

Given this information, Hamtai does not have a productive case system in the traditional sense where nouns are inflected for multiple grammatical cases. Instead, it relies on postpositions to convey meanings that might be expressed through case inflections in other languages.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",10 or more cases,exclusively borderline case-marking

There are no distinct morphological markers that consistently indicate different grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc., on nouns.

Given this information, Hua falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",8-9 cases,no morphological case-marking
Ilocano,"Ilocano, a language spoken in the Philippines, does not have a productive case system for nouns in the way that languages like Latin or Russian do. Instead, Ilocano relies heavily on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. While there are markers that indicate relationships such as possession or direction, these do not constitute a full-fledged case system as defined in the context of grammatical cases.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Ilocano does not have a system of inflectional endings attached to nouns to indicate different grammatical cases. Instead, it uses prepositions and particles to convey relationships that would be marked by cases in other languages.
   - **Prepositions and Particles:** Ilocano uses prepositions like ""ti"" (for) and particles like ""ni"" (subject marker) and ""iti"" (object marker) to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
   - **Lack of Inflectional Paradigms:** There is no evidence of a paradigm where nouns change form to reflect different grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.

Given these characteristics, Ilocano does not fit into any of the categories that involve multiple cases or even borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines, does not have a traditional case system like those found in many Indo-European languages. Instead, it uses a combination of particles and word order to indicate grammatical relationships. These particles, often referred to as ""markers,"" indicate the roles of nouns in sentences, such as the subject, object, and various oblique roles. The primary markers in Tagalog include:

1. **Ang** - marks the subject or topic of the sentence.
2. **Ng** - marks the direct object or a genitive relationship.
3. **Sa** - marks locative, dative, and other oblique relationships.

These markers do not inflect the nouns themselves but rather function as separate words that indicate the grammatical role of the noun they precede. Given this system, Tagalog does not have productive case paradigms of nouns in the traditional sense.

### Reasoning:
- Tagalog uses particles (ang, ng, sa) to indicate grammatical relationships rather than inflecting nouns.
- These particles function similarly to prepositions in English rather than morphological case markers.
- The system does not fit into the traditional case paradigm where nouns change form to indicate their grammatical role.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

**Conclusion:** 3 cases",no morphological case-marking,3 cases
Usan,"Usan, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. In Usan, there are two primary cases that are productively marked on nouns: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. 

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Usan has a nominative-accusative alignment, which means it distinguishes between the subject of a transitive verb (nominative) and the object of a transitive verb (accusative).
   - The case marking in Usan is relatively straightforward and does not extend to a large number of cases. There are no additional cases for locative, instrumental, or other peripheral relations that would increase the count beyond the basic nominative and accusative.

Conclusion: 2 cases",exclusively borderline case-marking,2 cases
Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it is known for its complex morphological structure. However, Yimas does not use case marking on nouns in the way that many other languages do. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. The language uses a system of pronominal affixes on verbs to indicate the roles of the subject, object, and other participants in the action described by the verb. This means that the grammatical relations that are typically marked by cases in other languages are instead marked by verb agreement in Yimas.

Given this information, Yimas does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations, which means it falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

### Reasoning:
1. Yimas uses pronominal affixes on verbs to indicate grammatical relations.

   - **Linguistic Documentation:** The linguistic documentation and descriptions of Mpur do not report any productive case paradigms for nouns. This further supports the conclusion that Mpur does not use morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Mehek,"Mehek, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, exhibits a typological feature that is relevant to the determination of its case system. Based on the available linguistic data, Mehek does not utilize a productive case paradigm for nouns in the way that languages with clear morphological case-marking do. Instead, Mehek relies on other grammatical means, such as word order and prepositions, to indicate grammatical relationships that would otherwise be marked by cases in other languages.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Morphological Case-Marking:** Mehek does not have a system of inflectional endings attached to nouns to indicate grammatical cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. This absence of morphological case-marking means that nouns do not change form to reflect their syntactic or semantic roles within a sentence.
   - **Alternative Grammatical Strategies:** Instead of using cases, Mehek employs alternative strategies like fixed word order and prepositions to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in a sentence. This is a common feature in languages that lack morphological case-marking.
   - **Linguistic Descriptions:** Descriptions of Mehek in linguistic literature do not mention the presence of a case system. This further supports the conclusion that Mehek does not utilize morphological case-marking.

Given this information, it is clear that Mehek falls into the category of languages that do not have morphological case-marking.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Miwok (Southern Sierra),"The Southern Sierra Miwok language, part of the Miwok language family, exhibits a system of case-marking that is not as extensive as some other languages with highly inflected case systems. In Southern Sierra Miwok, the case-marking is primarily used to indicate certain syntactic and semantic relationships, but it does not have a large number of productive case paradigms for nouns.

Southern Sierra Miwok primarily uses case markers to indicate locative and instrumental relations, which are concrete or peripheral case relations. These markers are used to show the location or the means by which an action is performed, rather than marking a wide range of syntactic functions such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc., which are typical in languages with more extensive case systems.

Given this information, Southern Sierra Miwok falls into the category of languages that have ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This means that the language has overt marking only for specific, concrete case relations like locatives or instrumentals, rather than a full-fledged system of multiple grammatical cases.

Conclusion: Exclusively borderline case-marking",6-7 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking
Nez Perce,"Nez Perce is a Sahaptian language spoken in the northwestern United States. It is known for its complex morphological structure, including a productive case system for nouns. The language has a nominative-accusative alignment in its case marking, which means it distinguishes between the subject of a transitive verb (accusative) and the subject of an intransitive verb or the direct object of a transitive verb (nominative).

The primary cases in Nez Perce are:

1. **Nominative**: Marks the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative**: Marks the direct object of a transitive verb.
3. **Genitive**: Marks possession.
4. **Dative**: Marks the indirect object or the recipient.

Given this information, Nez Perce has a productive case system with five distinct cases.

**Conclusion:** 5 cases",10 or more cases,5 cases
Oneida,"Oneida is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Oneida people in the United States and Canada. It is a polysynthetic language, which means it tends to use complex words composed of many morphemes to express what would be entire sentences in languages like English. In Oneida, grammatical relations are typically marked by verb morphology rather than by case marking on nouns. 

In Oneida, nouns do not inflect for case. Instead, the language relies on verb prefixes and suffixes to indicate the roles of nouns in a sentence. This means that Oneida does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. The relationships between nouns and verbs are indicated through the verb's morphology, which includes prefixes and suffixes that encode information about the subject, object, and other grammatical relations.

Given this information, Oneida falls into the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Pomo (Southeastern),"Southeastern Pomo, a language of the Pomoan family spoken in Northern California, does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns.

Athabaskan languages, including Slave, are generally known for their complex verb morphology and relatively simpler noun morphology. In the case of Slave, the language does not have a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relationships and roles within a sentence.

In Slave, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically indicated by verb prefixes and other verbal inflections rather than by case markings on the nouns themselves. This means that the language does not use a system of morphological case-marking for nouns to indicate their grammatical functions.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for the number of cases in Slave is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Squamish,"The Squamish language, also known as Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, is a Coast Salish language spoken by the Squamish people in British Columbia, Canada. In terms of its grammatical structure, Squamish does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences.

Squamish uses a combination of particles and word order to convey meanings that other languages might express through case markings. For example, relational nouns and prepositions are used to indicate locative and instrumental relationships, rather than inflecting the nouns themselves. This typological feature aligns Squamish with languages that do not have morphological case-marking.

Given this information, the appropriate classification for Squamish in terms of case-marking is:

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",2 cases,no morphological case-marking

Washo,"Washo is a Native American language spoken in the region around Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada. It is known for its complex morphology, but when it comes to case marking, Washo does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, Washo uses other means such as word order and postpositions to indicate grammatical relationships.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **No Morphological Case-Marking:** Washo does not exhibit a productive case system where nouns are inflected to show their grammatical roles such as nominative, accusative, dative, etc. Instead, the language relies on syntactic structures and postpositions to convey these relationships.
   - **Postpositions:** Washo uses postpositions to indicate relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages. For example, locative and instrumental relations are expressed through postpositions rather than noun inflections.
   - **Word Order:** The language also relies on word order to a certain extent to indicate the syntactic roles of nouns within a sentence.

Given these characteristics, Washo fits the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wichita,"Wichita, a Caddoan language spoken by the Wichita people in Oklahoma, does not employ a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations. The language uses a combination of subject-verb-object (SVO) and subject-object-verb (SOV) word orders, and it incorporates pronominal prefixes on verbs to indicate the subject and object. This means that the grammatical functions of nouns are not marked by morphological case endings.

Given this information, Wichita falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Wintu,"Wintu, a Native American language of the Wintu-Nomlaki branch of the Penutian language family, exhibits a case system that is relatively simple compared to languages with extensive case paradigms. In Wintu, there are primarily two productive cases: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. 

The language does not have a wide array of cases like some other languages (e.g., Finnish or Hungarian), nor does it rely exclusively on borderline case-marking for peripheral relations. Instead, it maintains a basic distinction between subjects and objects, which aligns with the ""2 cases"" category.

### Reasoning:
1. **Nominative Case**: This case is used for the subject of a sentence.
2. **Accusative Case**: This case is used for the direct object of a sentence.

These two cases are the primary productive cases in Wintu, and there is no extensive system of additional cases for other grammatical functions.

### Conclusion:
2 cases",4 cases,2 cases
Acoma,"Acoma, also known as Keresan, is a language spoken by the Acoma Pueblo people in New Mexico. It belongs to the Keresan language family. In terms of its grammatical structure, Acoma does not utilize a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and other grammatical markers to indicate syntactic relationships within sentences.

### Reasoning:
1. **No Productive Case Paradigms**: Acoma does not have a system of morphological case-marking for nouns that would correspond to nominative, accusative, genitive, etc., as seen in languages with rich inflectional morphology like Latin or Russian.
2. **Reliance on Word Order and Particles**: The language primarily uses word order and particles to convey grammatical relationships, rather than inflectional changes to the nouns themselves.
3. **Linguistic Descriptions**: Descriptions of Acoma grammar indicate that it lacks the kind of productive case system that would involve multiple distinct morphological forms for nouns based on their syntactic roles.

Given these points, Acoma fits the category of ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Nahuatl (Tetelcingo),"Nahuatl, specifically the Tetelcingo dialect, does not employ a productive case system for marking nouns. Instead, it relies on other grammatical strategies such as word order and prepositions to indicate the relationships between nouns and their roles in sentences. Nahuatl generally uses a combination of prefixes, suffixes, and particles to convey grammatical relationships, but these do not constitute a case system in the traditional sense.

### Reasoning:
1. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: Nahuatl does not have a system of inflectional endings that mark nouns for different grammatical cases. Instead, it uses other means such as prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships.
2. **Typological Characteristics**: Nahuatl is an agglutinative language, meaning it uses affixes to add grammatical information to words. However, these affixes do not function as case markers but rather as markers for possession, plurality, and other grammatical features.
3. **Linguistic Studies**: Studies on Nahuatl, including the Tetelcingo dialect, consistently describe the language as lacking a case system. Instead, the language relies on a combination of syntactic and morphological strategies to convey meaning.

### Conclusion:

Catalan,"Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to convey grammatical relationships that other languages might express through case marking. For example, Catalan uses prepositions like ""de"" (of) for genitive relationships and ""a"" (to) for dative relationships, similar to how English operates. This lack of morphological case-marking means that Catalan nouns do not change form to indicate their grammatical role in a sentence.

### Reasoning:
1. Catalan nouns do not inflect for case.
2. Grammatical relationships are indicated by prepositions and word order rather than morphological changes to the noun.
3. The language does not have a system of nominative, accusative, dative, or other cases that are marked on the noun itself.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a language spoken in the Netherlands, has a relatively simple case system compared to many other languages. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but over time, much of this has been lost. In contemporary Western Frisian, case marking is not productive in the same way it is in languages with rich inflectional morphology like Finnish or Russian.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Historical Context:** Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, similar to other Germanic languages. However, this system has largely eroded over time.
   - **Current Usage:** In modern Western Frisian, case distinctions are not marked on nouns in a productive manner. Instead, syntactic roles are primarily indicated through word order and prepositions, much like in English.
   - **Limited Remnants:** There are some remnants of the old case system in certain fixed expressions and in the pronoun system, but these do not constitute a productive case paradigm for nouns.

Given these points, it is clear that Western Frisian does not have a productive case system for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Mundari,"Mundari is a Munda language spoken in India, primarily in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal. It is known for its agglutinative morphology, where words are formed by stringing together morphemes without significant alteration to them. In terms of case marking, Mundari exhibits a system that is somewhat different from the more familiar Indo-European languages.

Mundari primarily uses postpositions rather than inflectional case endings to mark grammatical relations. This means that instead of altering the form of the noun itself to indicate its role in the sentence (as in nominative, accusative, etc.), Mundari typically places a separate word after the noun to indicate these relationships. This is characteristic of languages that do not have a productive case system in the traditional sense.

However, Mundari does have some markers that could be considered borderline cases, such as locative and instrumental markers. These markers are used to indicate specific semantic roles, but they do not form a comprehensive case system that covers all grammatical relations.

Given this information, the most appropriate classification for Mundari in terms of case marking is ""Exclusively borderline case-marking."" This is because the language uses overt marking for specific, concrete relations like locatives and instrumentals, but does not have a full-fledged productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",8-9 cases,exclusively borderline case-marking

3. **Dative** (marked by the suffix -a/-e, used to indicate the indirect object or direction towards something)
4. **Locative** (marked by the suffix -da/-de, used to indicate location)
5. **Ablative** (marked by the suffix -dan/-den, used to indicate movement away from something)
6. **Genitive** (marked by the suffix -ın/-in/-un/-ün, used to indicate possession)

These six cases are used productively in Turkish to mark various grammatical relationships and functions of nouns within sentences. The presence of these cases allows for a relatively free word order, as the grammatical roles of nouns are indicated by their case markings rather than their position in the sentence.

**Reasoning:**
- The nominative case is unmarked and used for subjects.
- The accusative case is marked and used for direct objects.
- The dative case is marked and used for indirect objects or direction.
- The locative case is marked and used for indicating location.
- The ablative case is marked and used for indicating movement away.

2. **Accusative**: This case is used for the direct object of a verb.
3. **Genitive**: This case indicates possession.
4. **Oblique**: This case is used when a noun is followed by a postposition.

The oblique case in Urdu is particularly interesting because it serves as a base form for various postpositional phrases, which can express a range of relationships such as locative, instrumental, and others. However, these are not considered separate cases but rather postpositional constructions based on the oblique form.

Given this structure, Urdu can be said to have four productive cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and oblique.

**Conclusion:** 4 cases",2 cases,4 cases

Kadiwéu,"Kadiwéu, a language spoken by the Kadiwéu people in Brazil, is known for its complex morphology and polysynthetic nature. However, when it comes to case marking, Kadiwéu does not exhibit a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations, which is a characteristic feature of many polysynthetic languages. 

In Kadiwéu, the relationships between nouns and their roles in sentences are typically indicated through verb affixes rather than through changes to the nouns themselves. This means that nouns do not undergo inflection to mark cases such as nominative, accusative, genitive, etc. Instead, the verbs carry the necessary information to indicate the roles of the nouns in the sentence.

Given this information, Kadiwéu falls under the category of ""No morphological case-marking"" because it does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",6-7 cases,no morphological case-marking
