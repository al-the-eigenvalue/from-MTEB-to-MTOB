Dyirbal,"Dyirbal is an Australian Aboriginal language known for its complex case system. The language employs a nominative-accusative alignment for pronouns and an ergative-absolutive alignment for nouns. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same way (absolutive), while the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (ergative). Additionally, Dyirbal has other cases to mark various syntactic and semantic roles.

The primary cases in Dyirbal include:
1. Absolutive (unmarked for intransitive subjects and transitive objects)
2. Ergative (marks the subject of a transitive verb)
3. Dative (marks the indirect object or the recipient)
4. Genitive (marks possession)
5. Locative (marks location)
6. Instrumental (marks the means by which an action is performed)

Given these cases, Dyirbal has a productive case paradigm of at least six distinct cases.

Conclusion: 6-7 cases",6-7 cases,6-7 cases

Amharic,"Amharic, a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia, exhibits a relatively limited case system compared to some other languages. In Amharic, the primary case distinction is between the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is unmarked and is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is marked by the suffix -n and is used for the direct object. Additionally, Amharic has a genitive case, which is marked by the suffix -yä and is used to indicate possession.

However, beyond these three primary cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive), Amharic does not have a productive system of case marking for other grammatical relations. Instead, it relies on prepositions and postpositions to express relationships such as locative, instrumental, and others.

Given this information, Amharic can be classified as having 3 cases.

**Reasoning:**
1. Nominative case (unmarked) for subjects.
2. Accusative case (marked by -n) for direct objects.
3. Genitive case (marked by -yä) for possession.

Igbo,"Igbo is a language spoken primarily in Nigeria and is part of the Niger-Congo language family. In the context of grammatical case-marking, Igbo does not exhibit a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships within sentences. 

In Igbo, syntactic roles such as subject, object, and indirect object are typically determined by their position in the sentence rather than by morphological case markers. For example, the subject usually precedes the verb, and the object follows the verb. Prepositions are used to express relationships that might be marked by cases in other languages, such as locative or instrumental relationships.

Given this information, Igbo falls into the category of languages with ""No morphological case-marking.""

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Iraqw,"Iraqw is a Cushitic language spoken in Tanzania. In terms of its grammatical structure, Iraqw does not exhibit a productive case-marking system for nouns. Instead, it relies heavily on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence. This characteristic aligns with the feature value ""No morphological case-marking.""

1. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lack of Case Paradigms:** Iraqw does not have a system of inflectional endings or affixes that mark different grammatical cases on nouns. This means that nouns do not change form to indicate their syntactic roles (such as subject, object, etc.).
   - **Reliance on Word Order and Prepositions:** Instead of using morphological case markers, Iraqw uses word order and prepositions to convey the relationships between nouns and other parts of the sentence. This is a common strategy in languages without morphological case-marking.
   - **Typological Evidence:** Studies and descriptions of Iraqw grammar, such as those by linguistic researchers, consistently note the absence of a productive case system. This aligns with the typological classification of Iraqw as a language without morphological case-marking.

Conclusion: No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Kinyarwanda,"Kinyarwanda is a Bantu language spoken primarily in Rwanda. Bantu languages typically do not employ a system of productive case paradigms for nouns in the same way that Indo-European languages do. Instead, they rely heavily on a system of noun classes, which are marked by prefixes that indicate various grammatical and semantic categories such as number, gender, and sometimes even locative relations.

In Kinyarwanda, grammatical relations such as subject, object, and possessive are typically indicated through word order and agreement markers rather than through inflectional case endings on nouns. For example, subject and object roles are usually determined by their position in the sentence and by verb agreement prefixes.

However, Kinyarwanda does have some locative prefixes that can be considered as marking locative relations, which might be seen as a form of borderline case-marking. These locative prefixes (e.g., ku-, mu-, i-) are used to indicate locations and can be attached to nouns.

Given this information, Kinyarwanda does not have a productive case system for marking grammatical relations on nouns, but it does have some locative markers that could be considered as borderline case-marking.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Tagalog,"Tagalog, a major language spoken in the Philippines, does not have a traditional case system like those found in many Indo-European languages. Instead, it uses a system of markers to indicate the grammatical roles of nouns in a sentence. These markers are often referred to as ""focus"" markers or ""topic"" markers, and they play a crucial role in the language's syntactic structure.

In Tagalog, there are three primary sets of markers that correspond to different grammatical roles:

1. **Ang-markers**: These are used for the subject or topic of the sentence.
2. **Ng-markers**: These are used for non-subject actors, possessors, and objects.
3. **Sa-markers**: These are used for locative, directional, and benefactive roles.

While these markers serve to indicate grammatical relations, they do not constitute a traditional case system with a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, they function more like prepositions or particles that indicate the role of the noun in the sentence.

Given this system, Tagalog does not fit neatly into the categories of languages with a specific number of morphological cases. Instead, it employs a system that is more akin to borderline case-marking, where overt marking is used for specific semantic roles rather than a full-fledged case system.

**Conclusion:** Exclusively borderline case-marking",no morphological case-marking,exclusively borderline case-marking

Yimas,"Yimas is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and it is known for its complex morphological structure. However, Yimas does not have a productive case system for nouns in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies heavily on verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations, which is a characteristic of many Papuan languages. 

In Yimas, the relationships between nouns and verbs are primarily marked through verb agreement rather than through case marking on the nouns themselves. The language uses a system of pronominal affixes on the verb to indicate the subject, object, and other grammatical relations. This means that the role of nouns in a sentence is typically inferred from the verb morphology rather than from case endings on the nouns.

Given this information, Yimas does not have a productive case paradigm for nouns. Instead, it uses verb morphology to indicate grammatical relations.

**Conclusion:** No morphological case-marking",exclusively borderline case-marking,no morphological case-marking

Awtuw,"Awtuw, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, is known for its relatively simple case system. In Awtuw, there are two primary cases: the nominative and the accusative. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative case is used for the direct object. This binary distinction is typical of languages with a nominative-accusative alignment.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Awtuw employs a nominative-accusative case system, which is a common alignment type where the subject of an intransitive verb and the subject of a transitive verb are treated the same (nominative), and the object of a transitive verb is treated differently (accusative).
   - The language does not have a more extensive case system that includes additional cases such as dative, genitive, locative, instrumental, etc.
   - The case marking in Awtuw is productive and applies to nouns, fulfilling the criteria for being considered grammatical cases.

Catalan,"Catalan does not have a productive case system for nouns. Instead, it relies on prepositions and word order to indicate grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. This is typical of many Romance languages, which have largely lost the inflectional case systems that were present in Latin, their common ancestor. In Catalan, the roles that might be marked by cases in other languages are instead indicated by prepositions (e.g., ""de"" for genitive, ""a"" for dative) and syntactic structure.

### Reasoning:
1. **No Morphological Case-Marking**: Catalan nouns do not change form to indicate different grammatical cases. Instead, prepositions and word order are used to convey relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence.
2. **Comparison with Other Romance Languages**: Similar to other Romance languages like Spanish, French, and Italian, Catalan has lost the inflectional case system of Latin. These languages typically use prepositions to express relationships that would have been marked by cases in Latin.
3. **Linguistic Evidence**: In Catalan, you would say ""el llibre de Joan"" (the book of John) to indicate possession, using the preposition ""de"" rather than a genitive case ending. Similarly, ""a la casa"" (to the house) uses the preposition ""a"" to indicate direction, rather than a dative case ending.

### Conclusion:
No morphological case-marking",no morphological case-marking,no morphological case-marking
Frisian (Western),"Western Frisian, a language spoken in the Netherlands, has a relatively simple case system compared to many other languages. Historically, Frisian had a more complex case system, but in modern Western Frisian, this has been significantly reduced.

1. **Reasoning:**
   - Modern Western Frisian primarily uses word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships rather than inflectional case marking.
   - The language retains some remnants of the older case system, particularly in pronouns and certain fixed expressions, but these are not productive case paradigms for nouns.
   - For example, the genitive case is largely obsolete in everyday usage and is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts.
   - The nominative and accusative cases are not distinctly marked on nouns; instead, word order typically indicates the subject and object roles.
   - There is no productive dative case marking on nouns in modern usage.

Mundari,"Mundari is a Munda language spoken in India, and it exhibits a relatively simple case system. In the context of grammatical case-marking, Mundari primarily uses postpositions to indicate relationships between nouns and other elements in the sentence rather than a rich inflectional case system. However, it does have some nominal suffixes that can be considered as case markers.

Mundari has a nominative case (unmarked), an accusative case (marked by a suffix), and a genitive case (also marked by a suffix). Additionally, there are locative and instrumental markers, which are typically considered peripheral or concrete cases.

Given this information, Mundari does not have a highly productive case paradigm with numerous cases. Instead, it has a limited number of cases, primarily focusing on core grammatical relations and some peripheral ones.

**Reasoning:**
- Nominative case: unmarked (subject of the sentence).
- Accusative case: marked by a suffix (direct object).
- Genitive case: marked by a suffix (possession).
- Locative and instrumental markers: peripheral cases.

These markers suggest that Mundari has a small set of productive cases, with some additional markers for specific semantic relations.
