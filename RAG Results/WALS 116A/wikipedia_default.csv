Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used alone to form yes-no questions. The examples provided always include an interrogative particle.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention any changes in word order to form yes-no questions. The structure of yes-no questions is described as being similar to declarative sentences with the addition of interrogative markers.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 17 mentions clause-initial yes-no question particles such as ""tähä"" and ""tä"".
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraphs 13 and 10 mention the use of clause-final question particles like ""la"" and ""bi"" to form yes-no questions.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of clause-medial question particles. The particles are either clause-initial or clause-final.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology being used to form yes-no questions. The formation relies on particles rather than changes to the verb itself.

Jamsay,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in this language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""ma"" is used as a clause-final interrogative particle to form polar questions. This is evident from Paragraph 1, which discusses the use of ""ma"" at the end of clauses to indicate questions. Examples include:
   - ""[n)a˘& n)E@˘-sa$-w ma$] [n)E˘$ -lu@˘-Ø]"" ('Have you-Sg eaten a meal, or haven’t you?')
   - ""ni@˘ yE@ sa$-Ø ma$ ni@˘ sa$˘-ra@-Ø"" ('Do they (=rocky hills) have water, or do they not have water?')

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation alone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that Jamsay uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- The primary strategy for forming polar questions in Jamsay is the use of the clause-final particle ""ma"", as detailed in Paragraph 1. This particle is added to the end of a statement to turn it into a question.
- There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Jamsay uses other strategies such as interrogative intonation, word order, clause-initial or clause-medial particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone to form polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ma'di,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can determine the strategies for forming neutral polar (yes-no) questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraphs 3, 4, 9, 11, 15, 21, and 32 mention the use of final rising tone or high tone to form yes-no questions. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Ma'di.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order specifically for forming yes-no questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used in Gumuz for forming polar questions. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question in NoG: ""Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question (7.66).""
   - This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 states: ""The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic while the remaining enclitics are word-final.""
   - Paragraph 3 also supports this: ""In SoG, one must also add the Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause (7.67).""

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each paragraph:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of a clause-final polar interrogative particle ""ba"" in Djenné Chiini (DjCh), but it is explicitly stated that this feature is unknown in other Songhay varieties, including Koyra Chiini (KCh). Therefore, this does not apply to KCh.

2. **Paragraph 4** discusses the use of ""wala"" as a tag question and mentions that clause-initial particle ""yala ~ yara"" is occasionally used instead of ""wala"" in simple or embedded yes-no questions. However, it does not explicitly state that this is a common feature in KCh.

3. **Paragraph 5** explicitly states that KCh has no reliable polar interrogative morpheme and that the usual simple polar question has the form of an assertion, usually with rising terminal intonation. This indicates the use of interrogative intonation only.

4. **Paragraph 6** mentions the use of ""wala"" in embedded yes-no questions, but this is more about disjunction rather than a direct strategy for forming polar questions.

5. **Paragraph 10** mentions the use of ""wala"" in embedded polar questions, but again, this is about disjunction and not a primary strategy for forming polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 46** provides examples of polar questions using ""wala"" as a disjunction. This suggests that ""wala"" can be used in polar questions, but it is not the primary strategy.

7. **Paragraph 48** provides an example of a polar question using ""ba"" in DjCh, but this does not apply to KCh.

From the analysis, it is clear that the primary strategy for forming polar questions in Koyra Chiini is using interrogative intonation only. There is no mention of other strategies such as interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed by raising the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at the end of a clause. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation.
   - Paragraph 5 also supports this by stating that a polar question in Mursi can be formed by raising the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at the end of a clause.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentences and polar questions are exactly the same. This implies that there is no special interrogative word order used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that a polar question in Mursi can be formed by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement. This suggests the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar questions, a constituent with a raised intonation is expected to take the focus position. This suggests that tone (specifically raised intonation) plays a role in forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Mursi are as follows:
- **Interrogative intonation only: 1**
- **Interrogative word order: 0**
- **Clause-initial question particle: 0**
- **Clause-final question particle: 1**
- **Clause-medial question particle: 0**
- **Interrogative verb morphology: 0**
- **Tone: 1**

### Final Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that a high tone is used at the end of the question, which is out of range for regular high tones. This is further confirmed in Paragraph 3, which states that polar questions in Majang do not need to be marked by any means other than a rising sentence tone at the end of the question.
   - Paragraph 14 also supports this by describing a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause as the only difference between questions and their affirmative counterparts.

2. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 introduces the question marker ""joː"" which always comes at the end of a question.
   - Paragraph 6 mentions another question particle ""kíː"" used in polar questions, which also appears at the end of the clause.
   - Paragraph 5 further supports the presence of clause-final question particles by mentioning that the question marker does not prevent the marking of the polar question by sentence tone.

3. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 indicates that the question marker ""joː"" can be used near the beginning of a sentence, marking the question as such. This suggests that it can appear in clause-medial positions as well.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, the strategies for forming polar questions in Majang are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only: 1**
- **Interrogative word order: 0**
- **Clause-initial question particle: 0**
- **Clause-final question particle: 1**
- **Clause-medial question particle: 1**
- **Interrogative verb morphology: 0**
- **Tone: 0**

### Final Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Birri,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Birri, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used as the sole strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not provide any examples or descriptions indicating a change in word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided text of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text does not mention a clause-final question particle explicitly used for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not provide any examples or descriptions of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions the importance of tone in Birri, but it does not explicitly state that tone is used to form polar questions.

Given the lack of explicit information on the strategies for forming polar questions in the provided text, we must conclude that none of the seven strategies are mentioned or confirmed.

**Conclusion**:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Tamashek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each paragraph relevant to polar questions:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions a clause-final particle ""yd"" used in yes-no questions.
2. **Paragraph 4**: States that yes-no interrogatives are simple sentences with an optional question particle or just with interrogative intonation.
3. **Paragraph 7**: Lists clause-initial particles for polar interrogatives as ""dk"" and ""qpm,"" and mentions that ordinary declaratives with rising intonation can function as polar interrogatives.
4. **Paragraph 29**: Provides an example of a clause-initial particle ""äk"" used in a polar question.
5. **Paragraph 34**: Shows an example of a polar question using the clause-initial particle ""dk.""

From these paragraphs, we can deduce the following strategies for forming polar questions in Tamashek:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraphs 4 and 7 indicate that ordinary declaratives with rising intonation can function as polar interrogatives.
2. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraphs 7 and 29 mention clause-initial particles ""dk,"" ""qpm,"" and ""äk"" used in polar questions.
3. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 1 mentions the clause-final particle ""yd"" used in yes-no questions.

The other strategies (Interrogative word order, Clause-medial question particle, Interrogative verb morphology, and Tone) are not mentioned in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Mambai,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the reasoning based on the relevant information:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""nà"" is mentioned multiple times as a question particle that appears at the end of the clause. Examples include:
   - ""víí Ø húmgò nà"" (who? 3:REAL come:VN QM) - ""who comes? / who is coming?""
   - ""mù té’là nà"" (2SG walk:VN QM) - ""are you walking?""
   - ""kwéé nà"" (Kwe QM) - ""is it Kwe?""

2. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""nà"" can also appear in positions other than the final position, indicating that it can be clause-medial as well. Examples include:
   - ""múù té’là yánà"" (2SG:NONPFV.NEG walk:VN NEGQM) - ""aren’t you walking?""
   - ""mù yó nà té’là"" (2SG indeed QM walk:VN) - ""are you indeed walking?""

3. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation as a strategy in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

4. **Interrogative word order**: There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Mambai uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

There is no mention of other strategies such as interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone for forming polar questions.

**Conclusion:**
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Gorowa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Gorowa. Here is the analysis of each paragraph relevant to polar questions:

1. **Paragraph 1**:
   - **Key Information**: Polar questions are usually marked by the particle ""xáy,"" which occurs as the first element in the phrase.
   - **Example**: 
     ```
     xáy, do’ u tlehhanâ
     xáy
     dó’
     ∅u
     house.LMO A.P- P.Mtleéhh -aán -â
     make.1-1PL -Q.PRES
     “Are we making a house?”
     ```
   - **Strategy**: Clause-initial question particle.

2. **Paragraph 5**:
   - **Key Information**: The term ‘topic’ marker is not particularly satisfactory for this form, as it occurs in several, seemingly disparate morphosyntactic environments, including on polar questions.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     gár a idór tsir/iroô
     gár
     ∅
     idór
     tsir/ír
     thing.LFR
     AUX manner.LFR bird.LFR
     “[...] the thing is like a bird?”
     =oo ~ˆ~
     =TOP -Q
     ```
   - **Strategy**: Clause-final question particle.

3. **Paragraph 19**:
   - **Key Information**: Topic marker as part of polar questions.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     gár a idór tsir/iroô
     gár
     ∅
     idór
     tsir/ír
     thing.LFR
     AUX manner.LFR bird.LFR
     “[...] the thing is like a bird?”
     =oo ~ˆ~
     =TOP -Q
     ```
   - **Strategy**: Clause-final question particle.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Gorowa uses two strategies for forming polar questions:
1. Clause-initial question particle.
2. Clause-final question particle.

### Output:
```
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0
```",clause-initial question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Shatt,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Shatt, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using only intonation to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no evidence or mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

Given the lack of explicit information on the strategies for forming polar questions in Shatt from the provided paragraphs, we must conclude that none of the 7 strategies are mentioned.

**Conclusion:**
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2**: It mentions that neutral yes-no questions are formed by adding a sentence-final question particle to a positive declarative sentence. This indicates the use of a clause-final question particle.

2. **Paragraph 9**: It reiterates that neutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentence-final question particle to a declarative sentence, with no inversion or other changes in the linear order of the sentence constituents.

3. **Paragraph 10**: It states that Koromfe has no tones, which rules out the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

4. **Paragraph 23**: It confirms that the intonation of yes-no questions is identical to that of statements, except that the sentence-final question particle can optionally have a high pitch and be lengthened for emphasis. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone is not a strategy for forming polar questions.

5. **Paragraph 36**: It mentions that the interrogative particles of various types of yes-no questions occupy the sentence-final position, reinforcing the use of a clause-final question particle.

6. **Paragraph 48**: It describes the use of sentence-final interrogative particles and the absence of clitic auxiliary verbs, which indicates that interrogative verb morphology is not used.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided, the strategies for forming neutral polar questions in Koromfe are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0 (The intonation is not distinct from statements, except for optional emphasis on the question particle)
- **Interrogative word order**: 0 (No inversion or change in linear order)
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0 (Not mentioned)
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1 (Sentence-final question particle is used)
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0 (Not mentioned)
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0 (Not used)
- **Tone**: 0 (Koromfe has no tones)

### Final Output:

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Nobiin,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nobiin, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation as a sole strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - The paragraphs do not provide any evidence or mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that interrogative sentences can end with a terminal particle, which is optional and can be dropped. This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: ""anki-min-na-i-remember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG"" (‘don’t you remember?’)

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 9 mention the use of suffixes that follow the verb/predicate and personal endings to form questions. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""daui-na-i"" (‘are you greater than god?’)

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the strategies for forming polar questions in Nobiin are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Nyimang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nyimang, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions. Here are the key observations:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of using only intonation to form questions in the provided text.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no clear evidence or example showing a change in word order to form questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - The text does not provide any examples or mention of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - The text does not provide any examples or mention of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to indicate questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - The text does not mention the use of tone to form questions.

However, there are multiple instances where the particle ""~"" (represented as ""~"" in the text) is used to form questions. This particle appears to be used in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial and clause-final positions. For example:

- ""i keru ~ tia?"" (Have you slept well?)
- ""i kide:> no £1 wen?"" (Do you understand?)
- ""i ~ war?"" (Do you want it?)

Given these examples, it is clear that the particle ""~"" can be used in different positions within the clause, including clause-medial and clause-final positions. Therefore, we should code for both ""Clause-medial question particle"" and ""Clause-final question particle"".

### Conclusion:

Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Lamé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Lamé:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The grammar explicitly states that polar questions do not show an intonation pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The grammar clearly states that polar questions are marked by the phrase-final particle ""su"". This strategy is used.
5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly states that polar questions are marked by the phrase-final particle ""su"".
- There is no distinct intonation pattern for polar questions.
- There is no mention of changes in word order, clause-initial or clause-medial particles, specific verb morphology, or tone changes for forming polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Wambaya,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Wambaya. Here's the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence but are said with a rising, questioning intonation.
   - Example: ""Gajbi murnd-u yana manganyma?"" (Can we eat some of this food?)
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Wambaya.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses a different word order for forming polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of an interrogative particle ""gayi"" in examples such as ""Balijî gayi-nyi?"" (Are you hungry?) and ""Gudayi-barligayi inîyajanji?"" (Is that dog cheeky?).
   - This particle appears in the auxiliary or alone in the second position in the clause, indicating it can be clause-medial.
   - Therefore, this strategy is used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses interrogative verb morphology for forming polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses tone to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Wardaman,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The provided paragraphs do not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation to form polar questions. The examples and descriptions focus more on particles and suffixes rather than intonation patterns.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided text. The examples given do not indicate a reordering of words to signal a question.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: The text does not provide evidence of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The particle ""ale"" is described as a tag question marker, which usually follows a statement and asks for confirmation. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Additionally, the suffix ""-gan"" is mentioned as a question suffix, which can occur at the end of a clause, further supporting the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: The suffix ""-gan"" is described as a question suffix that can occur within the clause, indicating that it can be clause-medial. The suffix ""-gula"" is also mentioned as an emphatic question suffix that can occur within the clause.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology changes to form polar questions in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that Gooniyandi does not have a distinct grammatical category for questions and uses the same forms for statements and questions. This implies that intonation might be the primary method for distinguishing questions from statements.
   - Paragraph 2 supports this by stating that requests for confirmation (yes/no questions) are expressed by the assertion of a proposition, suggesting that intonation plays a role in marking these questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any change in word order to form questions. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions the enclitic -mi or -ma, which is frequently found in requests for confirmation and is added to the word on which information focus falls. This suggests that a clause-final question particle might be used.
   - Paragraph 24 also discusses the use of -mi or -ma in requesting confirmation or disconfirmation, indicating its role in forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - The enclitic -mi or -ma can follow any constituent, including non-verbal ones, as indicated in Paragraph 2. This suggests that it can appear clause-medially as well.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",no interrogative-declarative distinction,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Tiwi,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used in Tiwi for forming polar questions. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being the sole marker for polar questions. However, the presence of a question clitic and pitch changes suggests that intonation alone is not the primary strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The grammar explicitly states that direct questions or 'yes/no' questions are not structurally different from other types of clauses, except for the optional question clitic and pitch change. This implies that interrogative word order is not used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The grammar mentions an optional question clitic ""-ana"" on the final word of the clause, which indicates a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: The grammar mentions an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the final word in a question, whether or not the question clitic is present. This indicates the use of tone in forming polar questions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Tiwi are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0
- **Tone**: 1

### Output

```
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1

Garrwa,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, the following strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) can be identified:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that polar questions are mostly expressed with rising intonation, similar to English question intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Garrwa.
   - Example: ""DG:ngala daba yal=i contr kill they=past ‘Did they kill that snake?’""

2. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 6 mention the particle ""kuna"" which often occurs in second position in polar questions but is not obligatory. This indicates that ""kuna"" can be used as a clause-medial question particle.
   - Example: ""kangku, na-nyina kuna ngambala kuluka FF this-loc q 1plInclnom sleep ‘Grandfather, are we staying there until tomorrow?’""

3. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 also indicates that ""kuna"" can occur in various positions within the clause, including the clause-final position.
   - Example: ""yuku kuna ninji all.right quest 2sgnom ‘Are you all right?’""

Given the information, the strategies for forming polar questions in Garrwa are as follows:

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

   - **Paragraph 6**: It states that ""the distinction between the question and Irrealis negative interpretation of the sentence is through its intonation contour."" This further supports the use of interrogative intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wagiman uses a different word order for forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that indicates the use of clause-initial question particles in Wagiman.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: Mentions ""There is also a tag question form gale, which can also be used as an interjection request for confirmation of a fact or other information.""
   - **Paragraph 5**: States ""The tag form gale occurs commonly in final position in questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour, has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the question by the addressee.""
   - **Paragraph 7**: Confirms ""There is also a word gale which generally occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'."" This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that indicates the use of clause-medial question particles in Wagiman.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wagiman uses specific verb morphology to form polar questions.

Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian),"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian), the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) can be determined as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The presence of questions formed without any explicit syntactic marker, as seen in examples like ""bróne díye spày-ile?"" (‘Is his son good?’), indicates the use of interrogative intonation to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no explicit mention or examples of interrogative word order changes in the provided text.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: The particle ""6n"" is used at the front of direct polar questions, as seen in ""6n máß6t šaqlêtla?"" (‘Can you take it there?’).

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: There is no mention or examples of clause-final question particles in the provided text.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: The particle ""6n"" can also appear before the final item in a clause, indicating its use as a clause-medial question particle, as seen in ""6n-ile-q†ìla, 6n-ile xìla."" (‘He has either been killed or he has been eaten.’).

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention or examples of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: There is no explicit mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

English,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can take the form of declarative clauses with rising intonation, as seen in examples like ""Your aim that evening, then, was to go to the discotheque?"" and ""So you went to the party but your brother stayed at home?"" This indicates that rising intonation alone can signal a polar question.
   - Paragraph 26 further supports this by stating that polar echo questions are signaled prosodically by rising intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that polar questions prototypically have the form of a closed interrogative clause, such as ""Is it breathing?"" This indicates the use of interrogative word order.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Korean,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Korean. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 1 mentions that with question-mark intonation, the casual style indicates a yes-or-no question. Paragraph 3 also states that when the interrogation is otherwise unmarked in speech, a rising intonation indicates a question. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone can form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Korean uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Korean uses a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 3 mentions the final postmodifier ""yl"" in ""-(ha)nunya"" and the interrogative ending ""-(su)p.nikka"" as markers for questions. This indicates the use of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Korean uses a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 3 mentions the interrogative ending ""-(su)p.nikka"" and ""-(ha)nunya,"" which are forms of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone is used to form polar questions in Korean.

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Basque. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions that yes/no questions need not be signaled by any mark other than interrogative intonation: ""Yes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative intonation.""
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Basque.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 10 also discusses verb fronting as a syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions: ""There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in particular verb fronting.""
   - This suggests that interrogative word order is used in Basque.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions the use of the particle ""al"" and the suffix ""-a"" in yes/no questions: ""Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions, such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a.""
   - This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 10 also mentions the particle ""al"" can be found in embedded contexts: ""al may also be found in embedded contexts.""
   - This suggests that ""al"" can be a clause-medial question particle as well.

Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that ordinary polar questions (yes-no questions) are not marked morphologically and are expressed only by a rising intonation contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any specific word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions a clause-final particle ""du"" used in alternative questions, but it does not indicate its use in ordinary polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used for neutral polar questions.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that ordinary polar questions are not marked morphologically, which implies that there is no special interrogative verb morphology used for forming polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Georgian,"Based on the provided paragraphs from a descriptive grammar of Georgian, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Georgian:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 4 (SYNTAX565) explicitly states that yes-no questions in Georgian involve no movement of words but are signaled entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a rise-falling pitch on the final syllable of the verb. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Georgian.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any changes in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Georgian.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Georgian.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 4 (SYNTAX569) mentions that alternative questions have high-falling pitch on the negative element in the second part of the question, e.g., ""mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu ara? = mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu àr mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'Are you going or not (going)?'"". This indicates the use of ""tu ara"" as a clause-final question particle in alternative questions, but not specifically for neutral polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not conclusively used for neutral polar questions in Georgian.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Georgian.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Georgian.

7. **Tone**: 
   - Paragraph 4 (SYNTAX565) mentions the use of a rise-falling pitch on the final syllable of the verb to signal yes-no questions. This indicates that tone is a strategy used in Georgian.

**Conclusion**:
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"

   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - If an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatorily takes the interrogative mood marker (Paragraph 1).
   - The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses (Paragraph 1).
   - In questions with explicit past time reference, the interrogative marker -HU is used (Paragraph 9).
   - The interrogative mood is employed for both question types: constituent and yes-no questions (Paragraph 5).

7. **Tone**:
   - Verbless interrogative sentences have a high-pitch intonation pattern (Paragraph 1).

Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 3 (23.1.2. Yes-no questions)**:
   - It explicitly states that yes-no questions in Udihe are not marked by any additional morphological means or changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. They are differentiated only by intonational patterns, specifically a higher and more prolonged intonational contour on the last word.
   - This indicates the use of **Interrogative intonation only**.

2. **Paragraph 7 (3.6.4. Sentence stress)**:
   - This paragraph supports the information in Paragraph 3 by stating that in yes-no questions, intonation rises considerably on the last word of the sentence. This further confirms the use of **Interrogative intonation only**.

3. **Paragraph 1 (24.1.2.3. Predicate focus)**:
   - This paragraph mentions that the subject is postposed to the postverbal position when the verb is questioned (yes-no questions). However, it does not indicate a change in word order specifically for forming yes-no questions, but rather a focus strategy.

4. **Paragraph 4 (7.8.1.3.2. Perfect in yes-no questions)**:
   - This paragraph discusses the use of the Perfect tense in yes-no questions but does not mention any specific morphological or syntactic strategy for forming yes-no questions.

5. **Paragraph 8 (23.1.5.4. Indirect yes-no questions)**:
   - This paragraph discusses indirect yes-no questions and the use of the particle -dA on the dependent predicate. However, this is specific to indirect questions and does not apply to direct polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 19 (23.1.3. Contrastive questions)**:
   - This paragraph discusses contrastive questions and the use of the focus clitic particle -nA or -nu, but it does not apply to neutral polar questions.

7. **Other paragraphs**:
   - The remaining paragraphs either discuss alternative questions, indirect questions, or other types of questions that do not pertain to the formation of neutral polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Udihe forms neutral polar questions using **Interrogative intonation only**. There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs for the use of other strategies such as interrogative word order, question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

**Chosen option:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar (yes-no) questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 13 mentions that the word, phrase, or clause that is in the scope of interrogation is initial, and the verb follows it. This suggests a specific word order for questions, but it does not explicitly state that word order alone is used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraphs 4, 5, and 8 indicate that the interrogative clitic ""=ii"" is used after the verb to form polar questions. This clitic can appear in the clause-final position, as shown in examples like ""tuox=ii?"" (strike?) and ""diesh=ii?"" (read?).

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative clitic ""=ii"" can follow the verb, which is typically in the second position in the clause. This suggests that the clitic can be clause-medial, depending on the structure of the sentence.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 4 describes the use of the interrogative clitic ""=ii"" attached to the verb, which affects the verb's morphology by undoing present-tense vowel shortening and altering the pitch. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that the interrogative clitic ""=ii"" has a prominent high pitch, which is a significant prosodic feature. However, it does not indicate a tonal system where tone alone distinguishes questions from statements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Ingush are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 1
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 1
- **Tone**: 0

### Final Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that if the question expresses surprise or doubt, the interrogative affix may be omitted, and the interrogative meaning is then expressed only by the intonation (rising on the finite verb form). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 indicate that the interrogative mood affix ""-ni"" is used on the finite verb to mark polar questions. This affix is clause-final as it attaches to the verb, which is typically at the end of the clause.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The interrogative suffix ""-ni"" is specifically mentioned as attaching to the finite verb, which is clause-final. There is no indication that it can appear clause-medially.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that ordinary polar questions are marked by the interrogative mood affix ""-ni"" on the finite verb of the sentence.
   - **Code: 1**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not mention any reorganization of word order to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-initial question particles.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text explicitly mentions the use of clause-final particles such as ""ree"" for forming polar questions (e.g., ""mə́ə-máa-dùu=ree"" for ""Don’t you like it?"").
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-medial question particles.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions preferred inflections for polar questions, such as ""Experiential perfect -bée"" and ""Stative -dó(o)"" which can take on polar interrogative illocutionary force.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of using tone to form polar questions.

### Conclusion

Based on the provided information, the strategies for forming polar questions in Galo are:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 27 mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle, indicating that interrogative intonation is used. This suggests that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Yup'ik.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 18 explicitly states that the question particle |qaa| is typically attached to the first word of a clause, forming a bound phrase. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 18 also indicates that the question particle |qaa| is typically attached to the first word of a clause, forming a bound phrase. This suggests that the particle can occur in a medial position if the first word is not the verb, but it does not explicitly state that it can occur in various positions within the clause. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 4 mentions that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and are characterized by the rhetorical question particle |qaa|. This indicates that interrogative verb morphology is not used for polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Washo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Washo, we need to determine the strategies used for forming polar questions. However, the paragraphs given do not contain explicit information about the formation of polar questions in Washo. They mostly discuss phonological, morphological, and syntactic aspects of the language without directly addressing the strategies for forming yes-no questions.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided text, we must conclude that none of the seven strategies for forming polar questions are mentioned or described. Therefore, we will code all strategies as 0.

**Reasoning:**
1. The paragraphs provided do not contain any explicit mention of interrogative intonation, word order changes, question particles (initial, medial, or final), interrogative verb morphology, or tone used specifically for forming polar questions in Washo.
2. Without direct evidence or description of these strategies, we cannot assume their presence.

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koasati,"### Reasoning:

To determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Koasati, I analyzed the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar. Here are the relevant observations:

1. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 lists various verbal suffixes, including those used for forming questions. Specifically, suffixes like `-67li` (simple question), `-6216` (tag question), and `-V7V` (interrogative internal change) indicate that Koasati uses interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 7 provides examples of polite questions formed with the suffix `-d:hi-`, further supporting the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 12 mentions the suffix `-ha?wa` used for rhetorical questions, which can be considered a clause-final question particle.

3. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 12 also mentions the suffix `-ha?wa` used for rhetorical questions, which can follow any constituent within the clause, including the clause-final position. Thus, it can be considered both clause-medial and clause-final.

4. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 16 discusses gapped sentences where the interrogative nature is marked only by intonation, without any verbal marking. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.

5. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no explicit mention of clause-initial question particles in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative word order changes in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no explicit mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Koasati are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 1
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 1
- **Tone**: 0

### Final Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Chumash (Barbareño),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Barbareño Chumash, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The examples provided show the use of the particle ""kike"" or ""ki:ki"" at the beginning of questions (e.g., ""kike kikihilsunG-wus""). Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The examples show the use of the particle ""ké"" before the verb (e.g., ""ké hi=s~-am -eqwel hi=l =stuk""). This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

**Reasoning**:
- The examples provided show the use of particles ""kike"" or ""ki:ki"" at the beginning of questions, indicating a clause-initial question particle.
- The particle ""ké"" is used before the verb, indicating a clause-medial question particle.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly mentions that yes/no questions can be formed without the particle ""ye"" by using exaggerated rising intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Yuchi uses a specific word order to form polar questions. The examples and descriptions focus on particles and intonation rather than word order changes.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 mentions the particle ""ya"" used for yes/no questions, which is placed at the beginning of the sentence. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and several other paragraphs (e.g., Paragraph 10) describe the particle ""le"" which can be placed at the end of a complete phrase, including the end of the verb phrase, indicating it can function as a clause-final question particle.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 7 describe the particle ""le"" as preferring the second position in the clause, which means it can appear after the first complete phrase. This indicates that ""le"" can be a clause-medial question particle.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. The formation of yes/no questions relies on particles and intonation rather than morphological changes to the verb.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no specific mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The descriptions focus on intonation and particles.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in Alsea. The paragraphs discuss various grammatical features, such as suffixation, pronouns, and verb forms, but none of them directly address the formation of polar (yes-no) questions.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation patterns related to questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no discussion of word order changes for forming questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: No particles are mentioned that specifically function as clause-initial question particles.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of any clause-final particles used for questions.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: No clause-medial particles for questions are described.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication of verb morphology specifically used for forming questions.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tonal changes for forming questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, I will analyze the information to determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 19**:
   - ""It is a simple matter to change statements into questions that can be answered yes or no.""
   - This indicates that there is a straightforward method to convert statements into polar questions, but it does not specify the exact strategy.

2. **Paragraph 20**:
   - ""What word part is changed when a statement is substituted for a question? The word part (ti) is dropped and (na, ne) is added.""
   - This suggests that there is a morphological change in the verb to form questions, specifically by dropping ""ti"" and adding ""na"" or ""ne"".

3. **Paragraph 27**:
   - ""Interrogative forms of non-singular verbs: the interrogative prefix ka is used.""
   - This indicates the presence of an interrogative prefix ""ka"" used in forming questions.

4. **Paragraph 38**:
   - ""In each form, the indicative prefix is dropped and the form kaaka/kaski is substituted.""
   - This further supports the use of the interrogative prefix ""ka"" and its variants in forming questions.

5. **Paragraph 45**:
   - ""kaNAxwaaWlhtifku’ ‘are you talking?’""
   - This example shows the use of the interrogative prefix ""ka"" in forming a question.

From the analysis, it is clear that Arikara uses interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions by adding specific prefixes or changing parts of the verb.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Takelma,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 14 mentions the use of a raised pitch in questions, similar to the English intonation pattern for questions. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the interrogative particle ""di"" at the end of the clause (e.g., ""helela’t'tdi pip HE SING?"").

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 13 indicate that the interrogative particle ""di"" can appear in the second position in the sentence, suggesting it can be clause-medial.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 14 describes the use of raised pitch for questions, similar to English.

3. **Paragraph 20** reiterates that yes/no questions are part of non-declarative operations but does not provide further specifics.

Given the information from Paragraph 1, we can conclude that Nxa?amxcin uses a question particle ""sa?"" to form yes/no questions. However, the exact placement of this particle within the clause is not specified. Since the particle's status remains unclear and no specific position is mentioned, we cannot definitively categorize it as clause-initial, clause-medial, or clause-final.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""

Given the information provided, the only strategy mentioned is the use of a question particle ""sa?"", but its exact placement within the clause is not specified. Therefore, we cannot assign a definitive code to any of the specific particle positions. All other strategies are not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Hidatsa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hidatsa, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The paragraphs do not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The paragraphs do not mention a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Multiple paragraphs (e.g., Paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 29, 32, 33, 42) indicate the use of the suffix ""-ˀ"" as an interrogative marker attached to the verb. This is a clear indication of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the only confirmed strategy for forming polar questions in Hidatsa is the use of interrogative verb morphology.

Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Toqabaqita, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of declarative sentences, with the only difference being in the intonation. Declaratives have a falling intonation, while polar interrogatives have a rising intonation towards the end.
   - Example: 
     - Declarative: ""Qe qako naqa."" (It [food] is cooked/done now.)
     - Interrogative: ""Qe qako naqa?"" (Is it cooked/done now?)
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Toqabaqita.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order for forming polar questions. The structure remains the same as declarative sentences, with the difference being only in intonation.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, the strategies for forming polar questions in Toqabaqita are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The presence of the question particles ""ka"" and ""(a)xajo"" at the end of clauses indicates the use of clause-final question particles. Examples include:
   - (520) ""dà-xe=ka"" (‘is he going to come?’)
   - (494) ""amgiobüdaxajo"" (‘Is it a girl?’)
   - (146) ""daxe-nan=de=ka"" (‘haven’t they come?’)
   - (147) ""ax-oan=dexajo"" (‘shall we not go?’)

2. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particles ""ka"" and ""(a)xajo"" can also appear in positions within the clause that are not strictly final, indicating the use of clause-medial question particles. Examples include:
   - (520) ""dà-xe=ka"" (‘is he going to come?’)
   - (494) ""amgiobüdaxajo"" (‘Is it a girl?’)
   - (146) ""daxe-nan=de=ka"" (‘haven’t they come?’)
   - (147) ""ax-oan=dexajo"" (‘shall we not go?’)

3. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The use of interrogative particles that are bound to the verb, such as ""ka"" and ""(a)xajo"", which can follow the verb directly, indicates interrogative verb morphology. Examples include:
   - (520) ""dà-xe=ka"" (‘is he going to come?’)
   - (494) ""amgiobüdaxajo"" (‘Is it a girl?’)
   - (146) ""daxe-nan=de=ka"" (‘haven’t they come?’)
   - (147) ""ax-oan=dexajo"" (‘shall we not go?’)

4. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that intonation might play a role in marking questions, but there is no explicit information confirming its use. Therefore, we cannot definitively code this as present.

5. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs to suggest the use of clause-initial question particles.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

Motuna,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed with the intonation of a polar question.
   - Paragraph 4 describes the intonation pattern for polar questions, indicating a rising pitch followed by a sharp falling contour.
   - This confirms the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about changing the word order to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about the use of clause-initial particles to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions discourse markers ""nee"" and ""nehe"" that play a similar role to tag questions in English and can be placed at the end of a sentence.
   - This suggests the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 also mentions that the discourse markers ""nee"" and ""nehe"" can be placed after the first word in a sentence.
   - This suggests the presence of clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that question words are pronounced with a high pitch, but this is in the context of content questions, not polar questions.
   - Paragraph 4 describes the intonation pattern for polar questions, but it does not indicate a tonal change independent of intonation.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Taulil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taulil, the following strategies for forming polar questions can be identified:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 (3.6.1 Polar questions) explicitly states that polar questions can be formed by changing the intonation, with a pitch change located on the last two syllables, involving a penultimate syllable rise in pitch and a slight rise in pitch and elongation of the last syllable.
   - Paragraph 2 (2.4.2.2 Questions) further supports this by describing the pitch contours of polar questions, indicating a steep rise and fall on the last word of the utterance.

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 (3.6.1 Polar questions) provides an example (163) where the sentence ends with ""nə-bo?"" indicating a clause-final question particle. This is further supported by the example in Paragraph 8 (708) where ""a-bi?"" is used at the end of the sentence.

3. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 (3.6.1 Polar questions) and Paragraph 8 (708) show that the question particle can appear in the middle of the clause, as seen in the example ""me ta-ti∼vi ko təkə=nə-bo?"" where ""nə-bo"" is used within the clause.

The other strategies (Interrogative word order, Clause-initial question particle, Interrogative verb morphology, and Tone) are not explicitly mentioned or supported by the provided paragraphs.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text mentions that polar questions can be answered affirmatively by ""ae ‘yes’, uttered with a rising pitch,"" indicating that intonation plays a role in forming questions. However, it does not explicitly state that intonation alone can form a question without the interrogative marker.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The text explicitly states that ""No variations in word order are required"" for forming polar questions, which means that interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Maybrat.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text clearly states that polar questions are characterized by the presence of the interrogative marker ""a"" in clause-final position. This is a definitive strategy used in Maybrat.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not mention any clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

Asmat,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions: ""I found in questions only the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.""
   - Paragraph 11 states: ""Question markers en and an appear to alternate freely; en occurs most frequently. After a h , however, an always occurs. en/an occurs in interrogative sentences in which an inquiry is made regarding the identity of a person or a thing, or about the nature of something. It can be linked to verbs, substantives, and adjectives.""
   - Paragraph 19: ""The construction with the question marker en/an occurs with em and tep: en are you? d-tep-ic en is it (above)?""
   - Paragraph 10: ""With some exceptions which will be mentioned later, ew always occurs in combination with either the interrogative form of the verb, with an interrogative, or with one of the question markers en/an and @n/pen.""

2. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 4: ""I found in the texts a few cases of informal interrogative forms characterized by the suffix -an.""
   - Paragraph 16: ""In these categories there is again a distinction between non-mood forms and mood forms. In addition, there is a series of interrogative forms characterized by the suffix -an.""
   - Paragraph 3: ""I noted the following interrogative forms: shall I give him 1. t e t h - c e m a m 3. t e t h - c W n & 6. tetam-cemdn 9. tetam-cZmmOm 11. t e t h - c & b n o k h 14. tetdm-cWan.h will you give him will he give him shall we give him will you give him will they give him.""

3. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 19: ""The construction with the question marker en/an occurs with em and tep: en are you? d-tep-ic en is it (above)? em-c&vn.""
   - Paragraph 11: ""Question markers en and an appear to alternate freely; en occurs most frequently. After a h , however, an always occurs. en/an occurs in interrogative sentences in which an inquiry is made regarding the identity of a person or a thing, or about the nature of something. It can be linked to verbs, substantives, and adjectives.""

Given the information, we can conclude that Asmat uses clause-final and clause-medial question particles, as well as interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kuot,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that yes/no questions have a very distinctive sharp pitch rise on the last syllable.
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that yes/no questions are marked only by intonation, primarily a sharp rise on the last syllable.
   - Paragraph 3 confirms that Kuot uses pitch (typically a rise at the end of the utterance) to signal yes/no questions.
   - Paragraph 4 reiterates that pitch is used for signaling sentence types, including yes/no questions.
   - Paragraph 7 mentions that in yes/no questions, the rise on the final syllable can be very pronounced.

2. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions a final particle ""a"" that can be added when a positive answer is expected.
   - Paragraph 2 also states that if an affirmative answer is expected, a tag ""a"" can be added to the end of the sentence, which then carries the high pitch.

3. **Other Strategies**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the strategies for forming polar questions in Kuot are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only: 1**
- **Interrogative word order: 0**
- **Clause-initial question particle: 0**
- **Clause-final question particle: 1**
- **Clause-medial question particle: 0**
- **Interrogative verb morphology: 0**
- **Tone: 0**

### Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Imonda, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used as the sole marker for polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no indication that Imonda uses a specific word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The particle ""kai"" is mentioned as a clause particle used to form yes/no questions (Paragraph 3). Since it is not restricted to the clause-initial position, it can be placed in various positions within the clause. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The suffix ""-m(e)"" is used to form polar questions and can appear at the end of the clause (Paragraph 3). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The particle ""kai"" and the suffix ""-m(e)"" can appear in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial positions (Paragraph 3). Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The suffix ""-m(e)"" is used as an interrogative marker and is attached to the verb (Paragraph 3). Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Nimboran,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nimboran, there is no explicit information regarding the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions). The paragraphs focus on various aspects of phonology, morphology, and syntax, but none of them directly address the formation of polar questions.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no mention of intonation patterns specific to questions.
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no discussion of word order changes for questions.
3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: No particles are mentioned that serve this function.
4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: No particles are mentioned that serve this function.
5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: No particles are mentioned that serve this function.
6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of verb morphology specific to questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Abun,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: Paragraph 1 explicitly states that intonation is not a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no questions in Abun, as the intonation pattern for interrogative sentences is the same as that for indicative sentences. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a special word order for forming yes/no questions in the provided paragraphs. The structure of yes/no questions is indicated to be marked by particles rather than word order changes.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 17 mention the optional use of the initial question marker ""te"" at the beginning of yes/no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 17 state that the final question marker ""e"" is obligatory in yes/no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that a clause-medial question particle is used in Abun.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of any special verb morphology used to form yes/no questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the intonation pattern for interrogative sentences is the same as that for indicative sentences, indicating that tone is not used to form yes/no questions in Abun.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Meryam Mir,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that polar questions in Meryam Mir have the same form as declaratives but with rising intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question. Examples (S.64) and (S.65) illustrate this:
     - (S.64) ma- y kari-m paret dirup- o? 'Will you sweep for me?'
     - (S.65) ma suga dikri- o? 'Have you put in sugar?'
   - This confirms the presence of interrogative intonation only.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing the word order to form polar questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions a particle ""-aw"" cliticized onto the last word in the sentence, which operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or checking attention:
     - (S.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0aw? 'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'
     - (S.70) e no teb+teb baka-aw? 'He went on his own, didn't he?'
   - This confirms the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed without any overt morphological marking, as long as the intonation is rising. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Hatam uses a specific word order to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Hatam uses clause-initial question particles.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that either of two question markers, ""e"" or ""i,"" is used, and both are utterance-final clitics. This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no indication that Hatam uses clause-medial question particles.
   - **Code: 0**

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 (9.4.3 Polar questions) and Paragraph 2 (g. Polar questions and pe ‘POSB’) indicate that the particle ""pe"" (POSB) is used to form polar questions. It follows each constituent the speaker focuses on with his or her question. Examples include:
     - ""Weife glase le-te-bile pe?"" (Shall we two go goggling?)
     - ""Ei! Fori bofu pe?"" (Is it another pig?)
     - ""Nuboue pe fwi una-nu geni pulufo-fe?"" (May I get your coconuts?)
     - ""Une gife le-o-la-lee pe?"" (Are you hungry?)
     - ""Mene pe Tomas pe wa-be?"" (Shall I or Thomas go?)
     - ""Teti pe? We, teti pai."" (Is that all? Yes, that’s probably all.)

2. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The particle ""pe"" can follow any constituent within the clause, which can be in various positions. This is evident from the examples where ""pe"" follows different constituents:
     - ""Weife glase le-te-bile pe?"" (Shall we two go goggling?)
     - ""Ei! Fori bofu pe?"" (Is it another pig?)
     - ""Nuboue pe fwi una-nu geni pulufo-fe?"" (May I get your coconuts?)
     - ""Une gife le-o-la-lee pe?"" (Are you hungry?)
     - ""Mene pe Tomas pe wa-be?"" (Shall I or Thomas go?)
     - ""Teti pe? We, teti pai."" (Is that all? Yes, that’s probably all.)

3. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 (g. Polar questions and pe ‘POSB’) suggests that polar questions formed by the possibility particle ""pe"" are indistinguishable from statements like “possibly…” and it may be that an intonation contour distinguishes them from statements. However, this is not explicitly confirmed in the examples provided.

4. **Interrogative word order, Interrogative verb morphology, Tone**:
   - There is no mention of these strategies in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used in Kwomtari.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Inanwatan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that ""Usually just rising intonation is used to mark utterances as polar questions."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Inanwatan.
   - Example: ""Ebaro-wo?"" (close-be.3SG.F) - ""In the vicinity?""

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that polar questions can be marked by the optional sentence-final polar question clitic ""-qe"" (sometimes ""-e"").
   - Example: ""Mutero-go ge-reqa-sa-e?"" (one-CTRC) PLINC.S-go.PL-FUT-Q) - ""Shall we go together?""

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- The primary strategy for forming polar questions in Inanwatan is through rising intonation, as explicitly mentioned in Paragraph 3.
- Additionally, the use of a clause-final question clitic ""-qe"" or ""-e"" is another strategy, as mentioned in Paragraph 1.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Iau. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no indication that Iau uses a different word order for forming polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Iau uses a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The paragraphs mention the use of the question markers ""be"" and ""ba"" at the end of the clause to form yes-no questions. For example:
     - ""Au⁷ du⁹ bv⁸ i⁷ ba³?"" (Did he go hunting?)
     - ""Fv⁷ ba⁷ be³?"" (Is the plane coming?)
   - These examples clearly show the use of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Iau uses a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The paragraphs describe changes in verb tone to indicate questions. For example:
     - ""i⁹"" (go) changes to ""i⁷"" in questions.
     - ""du³"" (go along) changes to ""du⁸"" in questions.
   - This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs describe the use of different tones on the question marker ""be"" to indicate different degrees of certainty and the need for confirmation:
     - Tone 9: Speaker is relatively certain.
     - Tone 3: Speaker needs confirmation.
     - Tone 4: Speaker is unsure.
   - This indicates the use of tone to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""

### Explanation:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0 (No evidence of intonation alone being used)
- **Interrogative word order**: 0 (No evidence of word order change)
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0 (No evidence of clause-initial particles)
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1 (Evidence of clause-final particles ""be"" and ""ba"")
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0 (No evidence of clause-medial particles)
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 1 (Evidence of tone changes on verbs)
- **Tone**: 1 (Evidence of different tones on question markers)

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed with prosody, specifically rising intonation, which can function as a question marker in itself when added to an otherwise indicative sentence (93a). This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.
   - Example: ""wafoj?"" (How are you?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any changes in word order to form polar questions. The examples and descriptions do not indicate that Sentani uses a different word order for questions compared to statements.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Sentani uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the emphatic particle ""jæ"" at the end of a sentence to indicate that the scope of the question is over the whole sentence (93b). This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: ""anokokæ? jæ"" (Have you eaten?)

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Sentani are:

- **Interrogative intonation only: 1**
- **Interrogative word order: 0**
- **Clause-initial question particle: 0**
- **Clause-final question particle: 1**
- **Clause-medial question particle: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The question marker ""-e"" is specifically described as utterance-final, not medial.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 9 mention that questions are not expressed by intonation alone and that the question marker ""-e"" has its own tones. However, this does not imply that tone alone is used to mark questions.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can identify the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using only intonation to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no indication that Mehek uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The paragraphs provide multiple examples of the interrogative clitic =ka and =a, which attach to the final word of the sentence, typically the verb, to form polar questions. This indicates the use of a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: ""tawa nanda=fun=ka"" (Are you two a wife and a sister now?)
   - Example: ""dino-ko nanda fi=r=ka"" (Is that your older brother's spear?)

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no evidence that a clause-medial question particle is used.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no indication that Mehek uses specific verb morphology to form polar questions.

Abui,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Abui:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation to form polar questions. However, the presence of intonation as a distinguishing feature between interrogative and indicative constructions in content questions (as seen in Paragraph 2) suggests that intonation might play a role in polar questions as well. Therefore, we can cautiously code this as present.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples given maintain the same word order for both declarative and interrogative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no explicit mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The provided paragraphs do not mention any specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs mention that intonation differentiates interrogative and indicative constructions for content questions. This suggests that intonation might also be used for polar questions.
- **Interrogative word order**: There is no evidence of word order changes for forming polar questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: No evidence or mention.
- **Clause-final question particle**: No evidence or mention.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: No evidence or mention.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: No evidence or mention.
- **Tone**: No evidence or mention.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the strategies for forming polar questions in Arapesh (Abu) are as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: Paragraph 5 mentions that one way to ask questions in Abu' is by changing the intonation from a statement to a rising intonation at the end of the sentence. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.

2. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: Paragraph 5 also describes the use of the particle _ba uwa'_ (‘or not’) at the end of an indicative sentence to form a question. This particle can be contracted to _ba_, accompanied by a sentence-final rising intonation.

3. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: Since the particle _ba_ can follow any constituent within the clause, including the clause-final position, it can be considered a clause-medial question particle as well.

4. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraph 5 provides examples where the verb morphology changes to indicate a question. For instance, the verb form changes in the example ""ni-i-k-e-hi'i"" (Is he coming?).

The other strategies (Interrogative word order, Clause-initial question particle, and Tone) are not mentioned or indicated in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The change from statement intonation to a rising intonation at the end of the sentence is explicitly mentioned.
- **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The use of _ba uwa'_ at the end of a sentence to form a question is described.
- **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: The particle _ba_ can follow any constituent, including the clause-final position.
- **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The change in verb morphology to indicate a question is shown in the examples provided.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Korafe often terminate with a distinctive intonation contour. This contour begins with a falling pitch, then manifests a slight rising pitch and an optional falling pitch. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation.
   - Example 4.106 ""Ni geka s-aresa?"" ('Do you want to make a comment?') shows a polar question without any tag words, relying on intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 mention the use of tag words like ""ai?"" ('yes?') and ""ai tefa?"" ('yes or no?') at the end of polar questions.
   - Examples such as 4.107 ""Ari a=ma eveva=ri, at?"" ('Are those deeds good, yes?') and 4.108 ""Ni y-aresa, ai telo?"" ('Will you go, yes or no?') illustrate the use of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 6 discuss the use of speech-act value markers like {-i} to indicate questions, including polar questions. This marker is attached to the verb.
   - Example 6.20 ""Ni rejo jug-eteso sino r-ise gangara+re-s-i?"" ('What did you throw that while the dog is eating (it), he is growling?') shows the use of the marker {-i} on the verb to indicate a question.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no explicit mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""

This conclusion is based on the presence of distinctive intonation patterns, clause-final question particles, and interrogative verb morphology as described in the provided paragraphs.","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Alamblak,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 6 mentions that yes-no questions tend to have a rising intonation, which is a common feature for marking interrogative intonation.
2. **Interrogative word order**: Paragraph 4 explicitly states that an interrogative element is not fronted in the clause and is ordered in the same way as in a declarative sentence, indicating that there is no special interrogative word order.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 5 states that all yes/no interrogative clauses are syntactically unmarked for the interrogative feature, implying that there is no special interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- **Interrogative intonation only** is present as indicated by the rising intonation mentioned in Paragraph 6.
- **Interrogative word order** is absent as the interrogative element is ordered the same as in declarative sentences (Paragraph 4).
- There is no evidence for **Clause-initial question particle**, **Clause-final question particle**, **Clause-medial question particle**, **Interrogative verb morphology**, or **Tone** in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
I'saka,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used as the sole marker for polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: Paragraph 6.1.2 mentions that the word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses, with interrogative pronouns appearing in the preverbal focus position. However, this is specific to content questions and does not provide evidence for a change in word order for polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: Paragraph 29 mentions that negation is marked at the end of the clause with the particle ""mi,"" but this is specific to negation and not to polar questions. There is no mention of a clause-final question particle for polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraph 13 mentions that verbs in I'saka inflect by prefix for subject, but there is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology for forming polar questions.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 43 discusses the use of tone in I'saka, distinguishing four pitch contrasts on single syllables. However, there is no mention of tone being used specifically to mark polar questions.

Given the information provided, none of the seven strategies for forming polar questions are explicitly mentioned or described in the grammar excerpts.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Urim,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Urim:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation to form polar questions. However, the presence of rising intonation in certain contexts (e.g., conjunctions before pauses) suggests that intonation might play a role, but this is not confirmed for polar questions specifically.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The grammar does not indicate any changes in word order to form polar questions. The word order in Urim is described as rigid SVO, and there is no mention of reordering elements to form questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text does not mention a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not mention a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no indication of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

However, the text does provide examples of questions using the word ""aki"" in a final position to express doubt or hesitation, which can be interpreted as a form of clause-final question particle. Additionally, the use of ""aki"" in questions like ""Kil kai aki kalpis?"" (Did he go or not?) suggests that ""aki"" functions as a question particle.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of ""aki"" in final position in questions indicates a strategy for forming polar questions.
- The rigid SVO word order and lack of mention of other strategies suggest that Urim does not use word order changes, verb morphology, or tone for forming polar questions.
- The absence of explicit mention of intonation, initial, and medial particles suggests these are not used.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the interrogative ""pankaw"" occurring clause-finally in a verbless clause (example 140).
   - Paragraph 2 states that ""pankaw"" occurs in a clause with imperfective aspect to indicate a polar question (example 138).
   - Paragraph 3 shows ""pankaw"" preceding a VP marked for the imperfective, constituting a polar question (example 139).
   - Paragraph 7 shows ""pankaw"" used in forming polar and measurement questions (example 103).

2. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that ""hai"" is often used in questions and gives special focus and importance to the sentence it precedes (example 15).
   - Paragraph 12 shows the future marker ""a"" used with the interrogative ""penkin"" (example 9), indicating the use of intonation in questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions ""hai"" used in questions and often set apart by a pause from the rest of the clause (example 15).

4. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions ""hai"" used in questions and often set apart by a pause from the rest of the clause (example 15).

5. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""pankaw"" indicates a polar question when it occurs in a clause with imperfective aspect (example 138).

6. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 23 mentions the intonation contour associated with sentences encoding the imperfective speech markers, distinguishing the interrogative (example 72).

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""

Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph provides examples of yes-no questions and their answers but does not explicitly mention the strategies used to form the questions.

2. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph is crucial as it describes the intonation pattern used in yes-no questions. It states that the last word stress in a yes-no question is appreciably higher in pitch than the others, and the pitch of any syllables following that stressed syllable falls markedly. This indicates the use of interrogative intonation.

3. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph mentions the particle ""yokri"" which frequently occurs in yes-no questions. It states that ""yokri"" may not occur clause-initially and most commonly occurs clause-finally. When it occurs clause-medially, it focuses on the constituent it follows. This indicates the use of a clause-final question particle and a clause-medial question particle.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph summarizes the strategies for forming questions in Awtuw. It confirms that yes-no questions are distinguished from declarative clauses by a change in intonation contour.

5. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses the focus particle ""po,"" which can occur clause-finally to focus the entire clause, often to express astonishment or vehemence. However, it does not specifically mention its use in forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Awtuw are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1 (Confirmed by Paragraphs 7 and 9)
- **Interrogative word order**: 0 (No evidence found)
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0 (No evidence found)
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1 (Confirmed by Paragraph 8)
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 1 (Confirmed by Paragraph 8)
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0 (No evidence found)
- **Tone**: 0 (No evidence found)

### Final Output:

Aymara (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph mentions the use of the suffix ""-ti"" in interrogative sentences. It states that the suffix ""-ti"" is used in sentences lacking a question word, indicating its role in forming polar questions. The suffix ""-ti"" is attached to the verb, which suggests the use of interrogative verb morphology.

2. **Paragraph 23**: This paragraph describes the suffix ""-sa"" as a question suffix attached to interrogative phrases introduced by a question word. However, it does not explicitly state that ""-sa"" is used for polar questions. Therefore, this information is not directly relevant to forming polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 24**: This paragraph mentions the use of ""-ti"" as an infix in verbs to form questions. This reinforces the information from Paragraph 10 about the use of interrogative verb morphology.

4. **Paragraph 10**: Additionally, this paragraph mentions that the suffix ""-ti"" is used in negative interrogative sentences, further supporting the use of interrogative verb morphology.

From the analysis, it is clear that the primary strategy for forming polar questions in Central Aymara is the use of interrogative verb morphology, specifically the suffix ""-ti"".

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 21** explicitly mentions the use of the enclitic **a** for forming polar questions, which occurs after the element under interrogation. This indicates the presence of a **Clause-medial question particle**.
2. **Paragraph 21** also mentions that it is possible to express interrogation without the use of **a**, by changing the intonational contour of the clause. This indicates the presence of **Interrogative intonation only**.
3. **Paragraph 26** reiterates that a change in intonation can indicate a question, but notes that this method has limited use due to potential ambiguity, reinforcing the use of **Interrogative intonation only**.

From these observations, we can conclude that Trumai uses two strategies for forming polar questions: **Interrogative intonation only** and **Clause-medial question particle**.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apinayé,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, the following strategies for forming polar questions can be determined:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 4 mentions that polarity questions may be expressed with the same structure as simple declarative clauses but with a distinct intonation pattern.
2. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 4 also states that the question may be introduced by the positional clitic ""c"" (alternative form ""co""), which occurs at the absolute clause-initial position.

No evidence was found in the provided text for the use of the other strategies: interrogative word order, clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

**Reasoning**:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly mentions that polarity questions can be formed using the same structure as declarative clauses but with a distinct intonation pattern.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: The text explicitly mentions the use of the positional clitic ""c"" or ""co"" at the clause-initial position to form polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, the following information is relevant for determining the strategies for forming polar questions in Yagua:

1. **Paragraph 3**: Mentions the placement of the yes/no question particle with reference to the beginning of the clause (second position within C).
2. **Paragraph 5**: Indicates that yes-no questions can be formed by suffixation of ""-viy"".
3. **Paragraph 10**: Provides examples of yes-no questions using the particle ""-viy"" attached to the verb.
4. **Paragraph 13**: Mentions that in yes/no questions, the clitic ""-viy"" occurs.
5. **Paragraph 14**: Discusses the yes/no question particle ""-viy"", indicating that it is phonologically a clitic but orthographically written as a separate word.

From these paragraphs, we can infer the following strategies for forming polar questions in Yagua:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation as a strategy in the provided paragraphs.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order for forming polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""-viy"" is mentioned, but it is not explicitly stated to be clause-final.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""-viy"" is mentioned to occur in the second position within the clause, which can be considered clause-medial.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The particle ""-viy"" is attached to the verb, indicating interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Cacua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Cacua can be determined as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used as the sole marker for polar questions. The grammar does not state that intonation alone is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar explicitly states that interrogative clauses do not differ from declarative clauses in word order. Therefore, interrogative word order is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit is used to mark polar questions. This clitic can occur at the end of the clause, as seen in examples like ""beh=nit"" (are you going?). Therefore, a clause-final question particle is used.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can also attach to various parts of speech within the clause, such as verbs, pronouns, and nouns, indicating that it can appear in clause-medial positions. Therefore, a clause-medial question particle is used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology (such as a dedicated interrogative verb suffix or prefix) in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.

**Reasoning**:
- The interrogative clitic =nit is used to mark polar questions and can attach to various parts of speech within the clause, including clause-final and clause-medial positions.
- There is no mention of changes in word order, dedicated interrogative verb morphology, or the use of tone for forming polar questions.
- The grammar does not explicitly state that interrogative intonation alone is used to form polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

   - **Code**: 0

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided examples.
   - **Code**: 0

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative marker `-ra` is a suffix attached to the verb, which appears at the end of the clause. This indicates the use of a clause-final question particle.
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative marker `-ra` is consistently shown as a suffix attached to the verb, which is clause-final. There is no evidence of a clause-medial question particle.
   - **Code**: 0

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The interrogative marker `-ra` is a suffix attached to the verb, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology.
   - **Code**: 1

Apurinã,"**Reasoning:**

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only: 1**
   - Paragraph 2 (8.8.2.1) explicitly states that polar questions in Apurinã are marked prosodically by rising intonation. This is the primary method for distinguishing interrogative clauses from their declarative counterparts.

2. **Interrogative Word Order: 0**
   - There is no mention in any of the provided paragraphs that Apurinã uses a different word order for forming polar questions. The examples provided in Paragraph 2 (8.8.2.1) show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle: 0**
   - None of the paragraphs mention the use of a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle: 0**
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle: 0**
   - The paragraphs do not mention any clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology: 1**
   - Paragraph 2 (8.8.2.1) mentions that in the Fortaleza village, there is a morpheme ""-ta"" used in the verb base to mark polar questions. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology in at least one speech variety of Apurinã.

7. **Tone: 0**
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Kadiwéu:

1. **Paragraph 1**: The author mentions difficulty in eliciting simple yes-no questions and notes that speakers provided sentences like ""When did you find clay?"" instead of ""Did you find clay?"" This suggests that the language might not use straightforward polar question formation strategies that are common in other languages.

2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the incorporation of the interrogative ""ame"" in locative/existential predicates and the movement of the interrogative ""ame"" with the prefix ""ig-"" for adjuncts. However, these examples pertain to content questions (wh-questions) rather than polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides an example of a question with the interrogative ""ame"" in a locative context, but again, this is related to content questions rather than polar questions.

4. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions that Noble Kadiwéu is a pitch-accent language, which involves contrast in pitch variation. However, it does not explicitly state that tone is used for forming polar questions.

5. **Paragraph 28**: This paragraph provides a general description of Kadiwéu phonology and morphology but does not mention specific strategies for forming polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 39**: This paragraph provides an example of a conditional sentence but does not provide information on polar question formation.

From the information provided, there is no explicit mention of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in Kadiwéu. The paragraphs mainly discuss content questions, phonology, and morphology without addressing polar question formation directly.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
