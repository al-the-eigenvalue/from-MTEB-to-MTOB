Supyire,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Supyire, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of forming polar questions using only intonation. The examples provided all include interrogative markers.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraphs do not mention any changes in word order to form polar questions. The structure of the questions remains similar to declarative sentences with the addition of interrogative markers.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The text mentions clause-initial particles such as ""tähä"" and ""tä"" which are used to form yes/no questions. This indicates the presence of clause-initial question particles.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Several clause-final particles are mentioned, including ""la,"" ""wä,"" ""k£,"" and ""bi."" These particles are used to form yes/no questions, indicating the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of any clause-medial question particles in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology. The formation of questions relies on particles rather than changes to the verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate between declarative and interrogative sentences.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-initial question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Jamsay,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jamsay, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The grammar does not mention that polar questions can be formed by intonation alone. Instead, it emphasizes the use of a clause-final particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The primary method described is the use of a clause-final particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. The described method involves a clause-final particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The grammar explicitly states that polar interrogatives are formed by adding a particle ""ma"" to the end of a statement. This is a clear indication of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The particle ""ma"" is described as being clause-final. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. The primary method involves a clause-final particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - The description mentions that the particle ""ma"" can have variable pitch and duration, but this is related to intonation rather than lexical or grammatical tone marking the interrogative. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ma'di,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 (Example 66) and Paragraph 3 (Examples 162, 164) indicate that a final rising tone can be added to a declarative sentence to form a yes-no question. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 (Examples 90, 91, 92, 93) and Paragraph 3 (Examples 158, 159) indicate the presence of a clause-final question particle ""ra"" or ""dì"" with a high tone.
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 (Examples 90, 91, 92, 93) and Paragraph 3 (Examples 158, 159, 164) indicate that a high tone can be used to mark yes-no questions, especially for emphasis or repetition.
   - **Code**: 1

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",tone,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Bangime,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not provide any explicit information about whether intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided text.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text does not mention a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not mention a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

However, the text does mention a ""question particle"" in the following sentence:

- ""Have you sold her? nìì ŋá nìì ŋá à kɔ́mɛ̀ náá ?""

Here, ""náá"" is identified as a question particle. The position of ""náá"" in the sentence suggests that it can follow any constituent, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the clause-final position. Therefore, we code 1 for both ""Clause-medial question particle"" and ""Clause-final question particle"".

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Let's analyze each strategy in detail:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question."" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that in SoG, one must add the Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause to form a polar question.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only:** The paragraph does not provide information on whether intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
2. **Interrogative word order:** There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided text.
3. **Clause-initial question particle:** The morpheme ""kona"" (with variants ""koni"" and ""kooni"") is mentioned as an apparent clause-initial polar interrogative marker, although it is rare and possibly a dialectal borrowing from Fulfulde. This suggests that clause-initial question particles can be used, even if infrequently.
4. **Clause-final question particle:** The conjunction ""wala"" is used at the end of a clause to form polar questions, functioning similarly to the German ""oder?"" This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle:** There is no evidence from the paragraph that a clause-medial question particle is used.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology:** The paragraph does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone:** There is no information provided about the use of tone to mark polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- **Clause-initial question particle:** The text mentions the use of ""kona"" (and its variants) as a clause-initial polar interrogative marker, albeit rare.
- **Clause-final question particle:** The text describes the use of ""wala"" at the end of a clause to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Tima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions in Tima:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not provide information about whether intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The example (122a) shows the word order ""2sg-go-2sg DIR-market,"" which is the same as the declarative form. There is no indication that word order changes to form a question. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraph. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The example (122a) shows the particle ""i-cuuk?"" at the end of the clause, indicating that a clause-final question particle is used to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The verb morphology in the question (122a) does not differ from the declarative form. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

7. **Tone**: There is no information provided about the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation alone being used to form polar questions. The grammar explicitly states that a question particle is required for forming questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that word order alone is used to form polar questions. The grammar does not mention any changes in word order for this purpose.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The grammar mentions that question particles can appear immediately after the first phrase of the clause, which can be considered clause-initial if the first phrase is the subject or another initial constituent. Therefore, this strategy is present.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar does not provide evidence of a clause-final question particle. The examples show question particles appearing after the first phrase or in other positions, but not specifically at the end of the clause.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The grammar indicates that question particles can appear immediately after the first phrase of the clause, which can be considered clause-medial if the first phrase is not the initial constituent. Therefore, this strategy is present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. The grammar does not indicate that verbs are marked morphologically to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. The grammar does not discuss any tonal changes for this purpose.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Katcha,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Ijo (Kolokuma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ijo (Kolokuma), we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - The text mentions that polar questions can be formed by a change of tone pattern, which is indicated by a question mark. This suggests that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.
   - Example: ""a b6-nimii?"" (is she here?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Example: ""eri, d6ma tun-a?"" (didn't he sing?)

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - The text does not mention a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - The text does not mention a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - The text mentions the addition of the interrogative marker ""-ia"" to form polar questions, which is attached to the verb.
   - Example: ""kjmi, oki-dy-ia?"" (has someone swum?)

7. **Tone**: 
   - The text explicitly states that a change in tone pattern can indicate a polar question. This is different from intonation and suggests that tone is used to mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""a b6-nimii?"" (is she here?)

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""",tone,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Emai,"Based on the provided paragraph, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Emai as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly mentions that polar interrogatives employ a higher pitch register while maintaining the same word order and essentially the same tonal patterns as declaratives. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph states that polar interrogatives manifest the same word order as declaratives. Therefore, interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Emai.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph mentions that polar interrogatives employ a higher pitch register but maintain essentially the same tonal patterns as declaratives. This suggests that tone, in the sense of changing the tone of specific words, is not used to mark polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that polar interrogatives use a higher pitch register while maintaining the same word order and tonal patterns as declaratives. This indicates that intonation alone is sufficient to mark a polar question.
- **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph states that polar interrogatives maintain the same word order as declaratives, indicating that word order does not change to form a polar question.
- **Clause-initial, clause-final, and clause-medial question particles**: There is no mention of any question particles in the paragraph.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to mark polar questions.
- **Tone**: The paragraph mentions a higher pitch register but does not indicate a change in the tone of specific words to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. 

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly mentions that polar questions in Ik are marked by an interrogative intonation, specifically a low boundary tone on the last mora of the question. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication in the text that word order changes to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text explicitly states that Ik does not use a clause-final question particle. It mentions that neighboring languages like Turkana use a particle -à, but Ik does not.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology. Instead, it mentions that the final morpheme in the clause takes a non-final form in questions, but this is not bound to the verb alone and is more about the overall clause structure.

7. **Tone**: The text specifies that the interrogative intonation involves a low boundary tone on the last mora of the question. This is a tonal change specific to questions, so we code this as 1 for tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""","interrogative verb morphology, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""na"" can be found clause-initially, indicating that Ngiti uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions. This is explicitly mentioned in the text.

2. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""ti"" generally occupies the second position in a clause, which is a clause-medial position. This indicates that Ngiti uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions. Additionally, the text mentions that ""ti"" can be reduced to a High tone and attach to the preceding word, which still places it in a medial position.

3. **Clause-final question particle**: The text does not provide explicit evidence that ""ti"" or ""na"" can appear clause-finally. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ngiti uses a clause-final question particle based on the provided information.

4. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention in the text that polar questions can be formed by intonation alone without any particles or other markers. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ngiti uses interrogative intonation only.

5. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not mention any changes in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ngiti uses interrogative word order.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific morphemes attached to verbs to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ngiti uses interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that the question particle ""ti"" can be reduced to a High tone, which attaches to the preceding word. This indicates that tone is used as a strategy to form polar questions in Ngiti.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1","clause-initial question particle, second position question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that in interrogative sentences ending in suffixed verbs, a very high pitch (higher than in their declarative counterparts) occurs in a specific location. This indicates that intonation plays a crucial role in forming polar questions.
   - Example: ""ani ot’-oo-mm-o ?"" (Did I (M) sleep?)
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology (such as a morpheme attached to the verb) in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly mentions that in interrogative sentences, a very high pitch occurs on the penultimate vowel segment of the sentence-final word, followed by a fall or remaining high pitch depending on the suffix type. This indicates that tone is used to mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""ise saale it-t-u ?"" (Did she eat food?)
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Mursi,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text mentions that polar questions in Mursi involve a raised intonation on the entire clause or specific constituents, such as the copula complement or the intransitive verb (e.g., ""a constituent which is the focus takes sentence-final position... with a raised intonation""). This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The text explicitly states that ""the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polar questions are exactly the same."" Therefore, there is no change in word order to indicate a polar question.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The text does not indicate the presence of any specific interrogative verb morphology. The examples provided show that the verbs in polar questions do not have additional morphemes compared to their declarative counterparts.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that a high pitch level can be shown on the intransitive verb in polar questions, indicating that tone can be used to mark polar questions. This is distinct from intonation, as it is bound to the verb.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that polar questions in Majang can be formed with a rising sentence tone at the end of the question. This is indicated by the sharply rising pitch on the final word of the sentence, as shown in the examples provided (e.g., ""máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?"").

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar does not mention any change in word order for forming polar questions. The examples show that the order of constituents remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""joː"" is mentioned as a clause-final question marker that stresses the polarity of a question. This particle appears at the end of the question and prevents the use of the interrogative sentence tone.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""kíː"" is mentioned as a question marker that can appear near the beginning of the sentence, especially in complex sentences. This particle marks the question as such early in the sentence.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The rising sentence tone used to mark polar questions is a feature of intonation rather than lexical or grammatical tone. Therefore, this strategy is not applicable.

Shatt,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the strategies for forming neutral polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar states that the intonation pattern for questions is not normally distinct from that of statements, except for the optional high pitch or lengthening of the sentence-final question particle. This implies that intonation alone is not sufficient to mark a polar question. Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar explicitly mentions that there is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the sentence constituents when forming neutral yes-no questions. Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar clearly states that neutral yes-no questions are formed by adding a sentence-final question particle (glossed as QUEST) to a declarative sentence. Therefore, code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as indicative clauses.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the examples provided.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text clearly states that polar questions are marked by the phrase-final particle ""su."" This is evident in multiple examples where ""su"" appears at the end of the clause.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The particle ""su"" consistently appears at the end of the clause.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication that polar questions are formed by adding a morpheme to the verb.
   
7. **Tone**: The text mentions that the interrogative particle ""su"" can have a mid or low tone, but this is used to place emphasis rather than to form a polar question. Therefore, tone is not the primary marker for polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Wambaya,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence but are said with a rising, questioning intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative particle ""gayi"" appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140) and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142). This indicates that it can appear in a medial position. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Wardaman,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that Gooniyandi does not distinguish declarative from interrogative moods prosodically. Therefore, interrogative intonation is not used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The text suggests that polar questions are formed by asserting a proposition with an expectation of confirmation or disconfirmation, not by changing word order.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.

The primary strategy mentioned for forming polar questions in Gooniyandi is the use of the enclitic **-mi/-ma IND** attached to the word on which information focus falls. This enclitic indicates indefiniteness and is used to mark the information focus, which is the part of the proposition about which the speaker is least certain. This strategy does not fit neatly into any of the seven predefined categories, as it is more about marking the focus of the proposition rather than using a specific question particle or changing word order.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",no interrogative-declarative distinction,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph mentions that polar questions in Tiwi involve an ""extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable (a stressed syllable) of the final word,"" which indicates that intonation plays a role in forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not present.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not present.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph mentions an optional question clitic ""-ana"" that appears on the final word of the clause. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, this strategy is not present.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph mentions an ""extra high pitch"" on the penultimate syllable of the final word, which is a feature of intonation rather than tone. Therefore, this strategy is not present.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Garrwa, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that polar questions are mostly expressed with rising intonation, similar to English question intonation. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text mentions that there is no particular question syntax, implying that word order does not change to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""kuna"" often occurs in the second position in polar questions, but it is not obligatory. Since ""kuna"" can appear in a medial position within the clause, this strategy is used.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided text.

Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The text explicitly states that yes/no questions need not be signaled by any mark other than interrogative intonation: 
     > ""Yes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative intonation"" (Example 818).

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""-a"" is mentioned as a marker for yes/no questions, which occupies the same position as complementizers, indicating it can be clause-final:
     > ""...while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers"" (Example 820).

3. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""al"" is described as a verbal particle that can appear in various positions within the clause, including medial positions:
     > ""...the former is a verbal particle"" (Example 819).
     - Additionally, examples show ""al"" appearing in medial positions (Examples 819, 821, 822, 824, 825).

4. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

5. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Verb fronting is mentioned as a syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions:
     > ""There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in particular verb fronting"" (Example 821).

6. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""al"" can also appear in initial positions, as shown in examples where it follows the initial verb or other elements:
     > ""Ba al dugu musikan euskal eskolarik?"" (Example 826).

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:

Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions the addition of the interrogative suffix ""-ao"" to transform sentences into questions. This suffix appears to be added at the end of the clause, indicating a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative suffix ""-ao"" is added to the end of the clause, not specifically to the verb. Therefore, this does not count as interrogative verb morphology. We code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iu Mien,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Iu Mien, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar explicitly mentions the use of the sentence-final particle ""fai"" to indicate polar questions. This particle appears at the end of the clause, marking it as a question. Example: ""Meih koi jienv nyei ↗fai?"" ('Are you playing (this tape recorder)?').

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar also mentions that polar questions can be indicated by a falling intonation, which is a change in the intonation pattern without the addition of any particles or changes in word order. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question. Example: ""Meih yiem naaiv lauh nyei ↘saah?"" ('You will be here for a long time, won’t you?').

Given these observations, we can code the strategies as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1 (since falling intonation can mark a polar question)
- **Interrogative word order**: 0 (no mention of word order changes for polar questions)
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0 (no mention of clause-initial particles)
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1 (explicit mention of the clause-final particle ""fai"")
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0 (no mention of clause-medial particles)
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0 (no mention of verb morphology changes for polar questions)
- **Tone**: 0 (no mention of tone changes marking polar questions)

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that ordinary polar questions are not marked morphologically and that the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a rising intonation contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone is sufficient to form a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraph.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraph.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph explicitly states that ordinary polar questions are not marked morphologically, which means there is no interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions.
   
7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. It specifically mentions intonation, which is different from tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Georgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Georgian, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in Georgian. The relevant information is found in section 5.1.13.1, which states:

- ""Questions of this type involve no movement of words but are signalled entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a rising-falling pitch on the final syllable of the verb, which will normally be the last word in the sentence.""

This indicates that polar questions in Georgian are formed using intonation patterns without any change in word order or the addition of particles or morphological markers.

### Conclusion:
- **Interrogative intonation only:** 1 (The paragraph explicitly states that polar questions are signaled entirely by intonation.)
- **Interrogative word order:** 0 (The paragraph explicitly states that there is no movement of words.)
- **Clause-initial question particle:** 0 (No mention of clause-initial particles.)
- **Clause-final question particle:** 0 (No mention of clause-final particles.)
- **Clause-medial question particle:** 0 (No mention of clause-medial particles.)
- **Interrogative verb morphology:** 0 (No mention of interrogative verb morphology.)
- **Tone:** 0 (The paragraph mentions intonation, not tone.)

**Conclusion:**  
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alutor,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Thai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Thai, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions in Thai. The paragraph mentions several particles used to form questions, specifically:

1. **MY**: This particle is used at the end of the sentence to form a direct question concerning something in the present or future.
2. **CHY MY**: This particle is also used at the end of the sentence and corresponds to ""is it"", ""are you"", ""does it"", etc.
3. **REU PLOW**: This particle is used at the end of the sentence for questions where the answer is unknown, similar to ""or not?"" in English.
4. **REU**: This particle is used in various contexts, including negative questions and idiomatic questions, and is also placed at the end of the sentence.

From this information, we can conclude that Thai primarily uses clause-final question particles to form polar questions. There is no mention of other strategies such as interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-initial or clause-medial question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Nganasan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nganasan, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in sentences without a verb, the only marker indicating the interrogative mood is intonation: a rise-fall tone.
   - Paragraph 2 reiterates that verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation.
   - Therefore, this strategy is present.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 2 states that polar questions do not require special word order and that the word order is usually the same as in declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not present.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 both mention that if an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb must be affixed with the marker for the interrogative mood.
   - Therefore, this strategy is present.
   - **Code: 1**

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:

Udihe,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that yes-no questions in Udihe are differentiated from declarative sentences only by intonational patterns, specifically by marking the last word with a higher and more prolonged intonational contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone is sufficient to form polar questions in Udihe.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text mentions that yes-no questions are not marked by any changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. Therefore, interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Udihe.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text states that yes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means. Therefore, interrogative verb morphology is not a strategy used in Udihe.

7. **Tone**: The text specifies that intonation, not tone, is used to differentiate yes-no questions from declarative sentences. Therefore, tone is not a strategy used in Udihe.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes-no questions are marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour on the last word.
- **Interrogative word order**: The grammar explicitly states that there are no changes in word order for yes-no questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: Not mentioned in the grammar.
- **Clause-final question particle**: Not mentioned in the grammar.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: Not mentioned in the grammar.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar explicitly states that there are no additional morphological means for marking yes-no questions.
- **Tone**: The grammar specifies the use of intonation rather than tone.

### Conclusion:

Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Ingush grammar, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The examples provided show the use of the clitic ""=ii"" at the end of the clause to form questions. For instance, ""diesh=ii wa?"" (do you read?) and ""diishâr=ii wa?"" (did you read?). This indicates that a clause-final question particle is used.

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions. The examples provided always include the clitic ""=ii"" to indicate a question.

3. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form questions. The examples maintain the same word order as declarative sentences, with the addition of the clitic ""=ii"".

4. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the provided examples.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-medial question particle in the provided examples.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology changes to indicate questions. The clitic ""=ii"" is used instead.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that the high tone of the interrogative clitic can be recorded on the clitic or the preceding syllable, but this is not the same as using tone alone to mark questions. Therefore, this does not count as a tonal strategy for forming questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - The grammar mentions that if the question expresses surprise or doubt, the interrogative affix may be omitted, and the interrogative meaning is then expressed only by the intonation (rising on the finite verb form). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""Wi dust.uni-z pul 2ga-naV."" ('Your friend has found money?!')
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. The examples provided do not show a change in word order as a strategy for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The particle ""jarab"" is mentioned as a sentence-initial particle used in questions, but it is generally used in (polar or parametric) questions with the Conditional suffix -t'a, and it translates to ""I wonder"". This does not seem to be a neutral polar question marker.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The interrogative mood affix -ni is used on the finite verb of the sentence to mark ordinary polar questions. This affix appears at the end of the verb, which is typically clause-final in Lezgian.
   - Example: ""Betxoven.a-n muzyka wa-z k'an-da-ni?"" ('Do you like Beethoven's music?')
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. The interrogative affix -ni is attached to the verb, which is clause-final.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The interrogative mood affix -ni is attached to the finite verb to mark polar questions. This is a clear example of interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""Wi dust.uni-z pul zga-na-ni?"" ('Did your friend find his money?')
   - **Code: 1**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:

Galo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided text that polar questions can be formed using intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not mention any changes in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""ree"" is described as a polar interrogative marker that can follow predicative noun phrases or declarative copula/finite/inflected clauses. This suggests that ""ree"" can appear at the end of a clause, marking it as a polar question. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""ree"" can also mark a cleft/focal NP, indicating that it can appear in positions other than the clause-final position. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any verb morphology specifically used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The text mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle, as in example (40). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change being used to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the particle |qaa| is used regardless of word order.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The particle |qaa| is typically attached to the sentence-initial word, forming bound phrases. This indicates that |qaa| can appear at the beginning of the clause.
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no indication that |qaa| appears at the end of the clause. The examples show it attached to the initial word or within the clause.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The particle |qaa| can be attached to the sentence-initial word or other constituents within the clause, but there is no specific mention of it being clause-medial.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The text explicitly states that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb. Instead, they are characterized by the rhetorical question particle |qaa|.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. The text discusses intonation but not tone as a grammatical feature.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation alone being sufficient to mark polar questions. The examples provided all include an interrogative suffix.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that word order alone is used to form polar questions. The examples provided do not show any change in word order for questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the examples or descriptions.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is added to the end of the verb, which is typically clause-final in Yuki. This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is attached to the verb, which is not clause-medial.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is added to the verb to form polar questions. This is a clear example of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Pipil,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Pipil, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes-no questions are formed with rising intonation, similar to Spanish, and no particular word-order changes are mentioned. This indicates that intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar specifies that there are no particular word-order changes for forming yes-no questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Pipil.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

Micmac,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tepehua (Huehuetla), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The grammar explicitly states that all yes/no questions in Tepehua are characterized by rising intonation. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences, with the addition of rising intonation or an interrogative pronoun.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The interrogative pronoun ""jaa"" is used at the beginning of a clause to form yes/no questions, as seen in examples (764) and (765). This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text. The examples do not show any particle at the end of the clause to mark a question.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The interrogative pronoun ""jaa"" appears at the beginning of the clause, not in the middle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no indication that polar questions are formed by adding a morpheme to the verb. The examples show that the verb morphology remains the same as in declarative sentences.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to form polar questions. The focus is on rising intonation, which affects the entire clause rather than specific tones on individual words.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Musqueam,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of intonation alone being sufficient to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone is used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The text mentions the use of ""1f-4.4"" as an interrogative marker that can appear at the beginning of the clause. This suggests the presence of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not provide evidence of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions the use of the suffix ""-e"" or ""-ce"" as an interrogative marker attached to the verb. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Omaha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Omaha, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that ""We do not raise the pitch of our voice to ask a question in Omaha as we do in English; a question sounds just like a statement."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is not used to form polar questions in Omaha. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing the word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraph. The examples given show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention the use of a clause-initial question particle. The question particle ""a"" is placed after the verb, not at the beginning of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph states that ""we place a question particle, a, after the verb."" This indicates that the question particle ""a"" is used in a clause-final position. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The question particle ""a"" is placed after the verb, which is typically in the middle of the clause. However, since it is specifically mentioned as being after the verb and not generally in the middle of the clause, this strategy is coded as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb itself to indicate a polar question. The question particle ""a"" is used instead. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. It explicitly states that the pitch of the voice is not raised to ask a question. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Washo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Washo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

**Paragraph 1:**
- The suffix ""-hé°S"" is mentioned as an interrogative marker added to a verb stem to form a question. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
- Examples provided include:
  - /di?latihé-Sti?i/ ‘shall I sit down?’
  - /?umgécaphé* 3i/ ‘are you kicking him?!’
  - /mimehé-sigi/ ‘do you drink?!’
  - /me?lécethé-3i/ ‘did you nibble?’

**Paragraph 2:**
- The suffix ""-ti?"" is mentioned as part of the Intermediate Future tense, but it is not explicitly stated as an interrogative marker. Therefore, it does not contribute to the strategies for forming polar questions.

From the analysis of these paragraphs, we can conclude the following:

1. **Interrogative intonation only:** There is no mention of intonation being the sole marker for polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order:** There is no mention of word order changes being used to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology:** The suffix ""-hé°S"" is used as an interrogative marker added to the verb stem, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Koasati, the following observations can be made regarding the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of intonation alone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone can form a polar question. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The suffixes mentioned, such as ""-6716"" and ""-V7h4"", appear to be clause-final question particles. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The suffixes like ""-6716"" and ""-V7h4"" are attached to verbs to form questions, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Chumash (Barbareño),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Chumash (Barbareño), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The paragraph does not provide any explicit information about the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided do not indicate any reordering of constituents to mark questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The paragraph mentions that most question forms in the corpus have a question particle placed before and/or after the verb. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle. For example, in (291), the particle ""2a="" appears before the verb.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The same example (291) shows that the question particle can also appear after the verb, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: Since the question particle can appear before and/or after the verb, it suggests that it can be clause-medial as well. Therefore, we code this strategy as present.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology (such as suffixes or prefixes) used to form polar questions. The examples provided do not show any morphological changes to the verb itself to indicate a question.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle 'le' is described as preferring the second position, which is after the first phrase. This indicates that it can appear in a clause-medial position. For example:
   - ""Yush'igowefa nedzedi'ne le?"" ('Will I see you on Tuesday?')
   - ""Maxine gowzene seyoki le je."" ('Did you get the quilt from Maxine?')

2. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle 'le' can also appear at the end of a phrase, which can be clause-final. For example:
   - ""Maxine gowzene re seyoki je."" ('Did you get a quilt from Maxine?')
   - ""Maxine le gowzne seyoki je."" ('Did you get a quilt from Maxine?')

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle 'ya' is used in sentence-initial position to form yes/no questions. For example:
   - ""Ya weyugone?"" ('How about Friday?')
   - ""Ya tse?"" ('How about you?/Are you?')

4. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that yes/no questions can be formed without the particle 'le' by using exaggerated rising intonation. For example:
   - ""Maxine 'le sio'y6thl'i?"" ('Is that Maxine's knife?') can be asked with just rising intonation.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, we can extract the following information regarding the formation of polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph does not mention a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The paragraph mentions that the particle ""-!"" occurs more often after non-verbal stems and seems to be added to verbs mostly. This suggests that the particle can appear in various positions within the clause, including medial positions. Therefore, we can conclude that this strategy is used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph states that both elements expressing interrogation are added to verbs and non-verbal stems. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we can conclude that this strategy is used.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.

**Reasoning**:
- The paragraph explicitly mentions the use of particles that can be added to verbs and non-verbal stems to express interrogation. This suggests the use of clause-medial question particles and interrogative verb morphology.
- There is no mention of the other strategies (intonation, word order, clause-initial or clause-final particles, or tone).

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no information provided that suggests a change in word order is used to form polar questions. Hence, this strategy cannot be confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not provide any information about a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The second paragraph mentions ""yes/no questions"" and includes the term ""interrog."" This suggests that there is specific interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions. The presence of ""interrog."" indicates that a morpheme is likely bound to the verb to mark the question.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, the only strategy that can be confirmed is the use of interrogative verb morphology.

Takelma,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The first paragraph describes the use of different pitch inflections in Takelma, but it explicitly states that the interrogative connotation is achieved by adding the interrogative particle ""di"". Therefore, intonation alone does not mark polar questions. **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative particle ""di"" is mentioned, but it is stated that ""di"" typically occupies the second place in the sentence, not the initial position. **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of ""di"" or any other particle being used in the clause-final position to mark polar questions. **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""di"" is described as typically occupying the second place in the sentence, which qualifies it as a clause-medial question particle. **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**: The first paragraph discusses pitch variations but does not indicate that tone alone is used to mark polar questions. Instead, the particle ""di"" is necessary. **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:

Jemez,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided text that polar questions can be formed using intonation alone. The examples provided always include an interrogative particle.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not indicate that word order changes are used to form polar questions. The structure of the sentences remains consistent, with the addition of the interrogative particle.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative particle /h&/ (or [h@]) is mentioned to follow interrogative words, which typically occur at the beginning of the sentence. This suggests that the particle can appear clause-initially when the interrogative word is at the beginning.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The provided examples do not show the interrogative particle /h&/ occurring at the end of the clause. It always follows the interrogative word, which is not necessarily clause-final.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative particle /h&/ follows the interrogative words, which can appear in various positions within the clause. This indicates that the particle can be clause-medial.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. The interrogative particle is used instead.

7. **Tone**: There is no indication that tone alone is used to form polar questions. The examples consistently use the interrogative particle /h&/.

Tunica,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph mentions the use of the interrogative postfix ""-n"" with any predicative word to form questions. This indicates that ""-n"" is a clause-final question particle. Examples provided include ""ka'tan"" (are you going?), ""ka’ 2a, ya’k?tk?ahédn"" (When will you come back?), and ""lo'ta wiwa'’ndn"" (Do you want to run?).

2. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The postfix ""-n"" is also used as an imperative and exhortative postfix, but in the context of polar questions, it is specifically mentioned as an interrogative postfix. This suggests that it is bound to the verb, marking the verb as interrogative.

The paragraph does not provide information about the use of other strategies such as interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, or tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Wappo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Wappo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. The relevant information is found in §104, which discusses the formation of interrogatives.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The postposition ""yo"" is mentioned as a suffix used in forming interrogatives, which can appear at the end of the clause (e.g., ""ina'otayo'a"" - what did I see?). This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""yo"" is also described as a postposition that can follow various constituents, indicating it can be clause-medial as well.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ute,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ute, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The grammar mentions several interrogative enclitics such as `-ru'a-`, `-tcu'a-`, and `-ntcu'a-` which are used to form questions. These enclitics are attached to verbs and indicate that the verb morphology is used to form polar questions.
   - Examples include:
     - `tona'va-n iar'oa Tja'rjA` (will he punch him?)
     - `ivi'y%ro'a` (art thou drinking?)
     - `qatcu'ru'axqa'"" nayqa'ywa'""` (do you not hear it?)
   - These examples show that the interrogative morphemes are phonologically bound to the verb, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology.

2. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The grammar does not explicitly mention a clause-final question particle. The interrogative enclitics are attached to verbs and do not appear as separate particles at the end of the clause.

3. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Similarly, there is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The interrogative enclitics are bound to verbs and do not appear in the middle of the clause as separate particles.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Interrogative word order**:
   - The grammar does not mention any changes in word order to form polar questions.

Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Toqabaqita, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that the structure of polar interrogatives is identical to declarative sentences, with the only difference being the intonation. Declaratives have a falling intonation, while polar interrogatives have a rising intonation towards the end. This clearly indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark a polar question.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph does not mention any change in word order for forming polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone (as opposed to intonation) to mark polar questions. The focus is on intonation patterns rather than tonal changes.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

#### Paragraph 1 Analysis:
- The examples provided in the table show the use of the clitic ""=ka"" and the particle ""(a)xajo"" to form polar questions.
- The clitic ""=ka"" appears to be attached to the noun or adjective in nominal and adjectival clauses, and to the verb in verbal clauses.
- The particle ""(a)xajo"" follows the noun or adjective in nominal and adjectival clauses, and the verb in verbal clauses.

#### Paragraph 2 Analysis:
- The paragraph mentions that polar questions are embedded in clauses ending in ""ka"" or ""(a)xajo"".
- Example (520) shows the use of ""=ka"" as a clause-final question particle: ""dà-xe=ka"" (come-N1.RLS[SG]=QST) translates to ""is he going to come?"".

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can determine the following strategies for forming polar questions in Aghu:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The clitic ""=ka"" and the particle ""(a)xajo"" can appear at the end of the clause to form polar questions.
2. **Clause-medial question particle**: Since the clitic ""=ka"" and the particle ""(a)xajo"" can follow various constituents within the clause, including the clause-final position, they can also be considered clause-medial question particles.

Other strategies such as interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, and tone are not mentioned in the provided paragraphs.

Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that polar questions in Makasae can be marked solely by a rising-falling intonation contour. This is evidenced by the example in (117) and the corresponding pitch contour in Figure 7.4. Therefore, this strategy is present.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of the markers =ua and =uai (na’an) as question markers cliticized to the right end of the question. Examples (120) and (121) demonstrate this usage. Therefore, this strategy is present.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The provided paragraphs do not mention any clause-medial question particles. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

Motuna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Motuna, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly mentions that in polar interrogative sentences, the final stressed mora has a rising pitch followed by a sharp falling contour. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question. Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention any clause-initial question particles used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph does not mention any clause-final question particles used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention any clause-medial question particles used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph does not mention any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph describes the use of intonation (rising and falling pitch) to mark polar questions, but it does not describe the use of tone in the sense of lexical or grammatical tone changes on specific words to mark polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

### Conclusion

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text mentions that all questions are marked by a distinctive rising intonation. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a question.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The focus marker remains in the position it would be if the sentence were not a question.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The focus marker ""meo"" is used for polar questions, but it does not necessarily appear at the beginning of the clause. There is an example where the focus marker appears initially due to ellipsis, but this is not a general rule.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The focus marker ""meo"" does not appear at the end of the clause. It stays in its syntactic position related to the questioned element.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The focus marker ""meo"" can appear in various positions within the clause, depending on the element it agrees with. This includes medial positions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative morphology attached to the verb to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Dla (Menggwa),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Dla (Menggwa), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that polarity questions are distinguished from their statement counterparts by intonation, with statements usually ending in low pitch and questions ending in high pitch (§2.4.2). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided text that word order changes to form polar questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as their declarative counterparts.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided text of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided text of a clause-final question particle being used to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided text of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions that there are no verb forms which indicate interrogative mood specifically (§6.1.4). This means that interrogative verb morphology is not used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from statements. The distinction is made through intonation, not tone.

**Reasoning**:
- The grammar explicitly states that polar questions are marked by intonation alone, with a high pitch at the end of the question.
- There is no mention of changes in word order, clause-initial, clause-final, or clause-medial question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone being used to form polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Duna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Duna, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here's the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative marker `=pe` is not mentioned as appearing at the beginning of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative marker `=pe` appears at the end of the clause in the examples provided (e.g., `ho=pe`, `kei=pe`, `na-nda=pe`, `hinia=pe`). This indicates the use of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative marker `=pe` can follow various constituents within the clause, including the verb and other elements, but it is not restricted to a medial position. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of a specific morpheme attached to the verb to indicate a polar question. The marker `=pe` is a clitic that can attach to various parts of the sentence, not just the verb.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Taulil,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taulil, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that intonation is the only cue to distinguish a declarative sentence from a polar question. Polar questions show a steep rise and fall on the last word of the utterance, where the rising may form the highest peak of the whole sentence, and the falling end point is still higher compared to other parts of the utterance.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions in the provided text.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone (as distinct from intonation) to form polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- The grammar explicitly states that intonation is the only cue to distinguish a declarative sentence from a polar question. This indicates that ""Interrogative intonation only"" is used.
- There is no mention of any other strategies (word order, particles, verb morphology, or tone) being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. 

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of intonation being used alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The examples provided do not indicate a change in word order to form polar questions. The word order remains consistent with the declarative sentences, and the presence of the clitic =ke is the distinguishing feature.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The clitic =ke can appear at the end of the clause, as shown in example (3-88b) ""Amani okɨnetke?"" where =ke is at the end of the clause.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The clitic =ke can also appear in the middle of the clause, as shown in example (3-88a) ""Amanike okɨnet?"" where =ke is attached to the subject ""Amani"".

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yimas,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yimas, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The text states that ""questions, the interrogative mood, have a corresponding rise"" in intonation. This indicates that a change in intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Example: ""----k-mpu-nan-tkam-t uralJ namat"" (Did the men show you the coconut?)

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The text mentions that questions can also be indicated by a sentence-final particle ""a"", which is always pronounced with a high rising pitch.
   - Example: ""uralJ k-mpu-nan-tkam-t a namat"" (Did the men show you a coconut?)

There is no mention of the other strategies (Interrogative word order, Clause-initial question particle, Clause-medial question particle, Interrogative verb morphology, Tone) in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we will code these as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Kanum (Ngkâlmpw),,not mentioned in the grammar,
Maybrat,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Polar questions in Maybrat are characterized by the presence of the interrogative marker ""a"" in clause-final position. This is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the examples provided (e.g., ""y-amo a"" for ""Is he going?"").

2. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The text explicitly states that ""Intonationally, all types of question behave in the same way as other clauses, that is there is a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause."" This indicates that intonation alone does not mark polar questions, as it does not differ from declarative statements.

3. **Interrogative word order**:
   - The text mentions that ""No variations in word order are required"" for forming polar questions. This means that word order is not used to mark polar questions.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**:
   - The text does not mention the use of tone to mark polar questions. It specifically states that the intonation pattern for questions is the same as for declarative sentences, which implies that tone is not used to distinguish polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Asmat,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Asmat, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no information provided that suggests a change in word order is used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no evidence in the text that suggests the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text mentions the use of the question marker ""en/an"" which can be linked to verbs, substantives, and adjectives. This suggests that ""en/an"" can appear at the end of the clause, marking it as a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not provide evidence that the question marker ""en/an"" appears in the middle of the clause. It is either linked to the end of verbs, substantives, or adjectives.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The text mentions the use of an interrogative suffix ""-an"" suffixed directly to the core in certain categories. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kuot,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that ""Yes/no questions are marked only by intonation; primarily a sharp rise on the last syllable."" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone is sufficient to form polar questions in Kuot.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The grammar does not provide any information suggesting that word order is used to mark polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions that a tag ""a"" can be added to the end of the sentence if an affirmative answer is expected, but this is for leading questions, not neutral polar questions. Therefore, it does not count as a clause-final question particle for neutral polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph does not mention any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph specifies that polar questions are marked by intonation, not tone. Intonation involves a sharp rise on the last syllable, which is different from tone marking.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Imonda,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The provided paragraph does not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication in the paragraph that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. Hence, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""kai"" is mentioned as a clause particle that can be used to form questions. Since it appears at the beginning of the clause in examples (20) and (22), this strategy is coded as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" is used as a question marker and can appear at the end of the clause, as seen in examples (21), (22), (23), (24), (25), and (26). Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" can be attached to various parts of speech within the clause, not just at the end. For example, in (23), it is attached to ""ed"" (there), which is not clause-final. Thus, this strategy is coded as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" is attached to verbs to form questions, as seen in examples (21), (24), (25), and (26). Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraph. Hence, this strategy is coded as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Nimboran,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can extract the following information about the strategies for forming polar questions in Abun:

1. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph mentions an initial question marker (IQM) ""te"" that occurs clause-initially. However, it also notes that this marker appears to be optional in modern usage. Despite its optionality, its presence indicates that clause-initial question particles are used in Abun.
   
2. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph explicitly states that there is a final question marker (FQM) that ends or closes the interrogative. This confirms the use of clause-final question particles in Abun.

3. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a question particle that occurs in the middle of the clause. The initial and final particles are specifically mentioned, but no medial position is indicated.

4. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not provide any information about the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

5. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph does not mention any morphemes that are phonologically bound to the verb to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Meryam Mir,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Meryam Mir, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that polar questions in Meryam Mir have the same form as declaratives but with rising intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question. This means that changing the intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle for forming polar questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the Kwomtari grammar, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that polar questions might be distinguishable from statements by intonation pattern, but this needs checking. Since it is not confirmed, we cannot code this as 1.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication in the provided text that word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""pe"" is used to form polar questions, but it follows the constituent being questioned rather than appearing at the beginning of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""pe"" can follow the final constituent of the clause, as seen in examples (22), (23), (24), (25), and (27). Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""pe"" can follow any constituent within the clause, as seen in examples (22), (23), (24), (25), and (26). Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication in the provided text that polar questions are formed by adding a morpheme to the verb. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: The provided text does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

Inanwatan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Inanwatan, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly mentions that polar questions are marked by rising intonation. This is evident in the examples provided, such as in (3.111) where rising intonation is used to mark utterances as polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided do not indicate any reordering of words to signal a question.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar mentions the optional sentence-final polar question clitic -qe (sometimes -e), as seen in examples (3.109) and (3.110). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   
7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. The focus is on intonation rather than tone.

### Conclusion:

Iau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not mention that intonation alone can mark polar questions. Instead, it specifies the use of a question marker and tone changes on the verb.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same, and the question is formed by adding a question marker and changing the tone on the verb.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. The question marker ""be"" or ""ba"" appears at the end of the clause.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar explicitly states that the question marker ""be"" or ""ba"" is added at the end of the clause to form a yes-no question. This is a clear indication of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The question marker appears at the end of the clause.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar describes that forming a yes-no question involves changing the tone on the verb stem according to the verb class requirements. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: The grammar specifies that different tones on the verb stem and the question marker indicate different degrees of uncertainty. This shows that tone is used to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""","clause-final question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"

Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The text explicitly states that polar questions can be formed with prosody, specifically rising intonation, added to an otherwise indicative sentence. This is demonstrated in example (93a) where ""wa foj?"" (PRO:2SG good) translates to ""How are you?"" with rising intonation marking the question.
   - Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided text. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

7. **Tone**:
   - The text does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.

Mpur,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - The text explicitly states that ""interrogatives and continuations cannot be expressed by intonation alone: interrogatives take question markers (§8) which have their 'own' tones."" This indicates that intonation alone is not sufficient to form polar questions in Mpur.
   - **Code**: 0

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about changing word order to form polar questions. The text focuses on question markers and does not indicate that word order is used to mark polar questions.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention any clause-initial question particles. The focus is on question markers and their placement within the clause.
   - **Code**: 0

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The text does not provide evidence of clause-final question particles. It mentions that interrogatives take question markers but does not specify their position as clause-final.
   - **Code**: 0

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The text does not provide specific information about clause-medial question particles. It only mentions that interrogatives take question markers without specifying their exact position within the clause.
   - **Code**: 0

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The text mentions that ""interrogatives take question markers (§8) which have their 'own' tones."" However, it does not specify whether these markers are bound to the verb or can be attached to other constituents. Without explicit information, we cannot conclude that interrogative verb morphology is used.
   - **Code**: 0

7. **Tone**:
   - The text states that ""interrogatives take question markers (§8) which have their 'own' tones."" This suggests that tone is used in conjunction with question markers to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

Mehek,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =ka attaches to the final element in the clause, not at the beginning. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =ka attaches to the final element in the clause, which is often the verb. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The clitic =ka attaches to the final element in the clause, not in the middle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The clitic =ka attaches to the final element in the clause, which can be a verb, but it is not exclusively bound to the verb only. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Abui,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Arapesh (Abu),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arapesh (Abu), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in grammatical strings where interrogation is not indicated by morphological signals, the intonation contour features a sharp rise to high pitch on the stressed syllable of the phrase-final syllable. This suggests that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Paragraph 2 also supports this by stating that one way to ask questions is by changing the sentence-final intonation to an abrupt rising intonation.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions adding ""_ba uwa'_ ‘or not’ at the end of an indicative sentence to form a question. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of adding a morpheme to the verb to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs discuss intonation rather than tone. Intonation involves pitch variation across the sentence, while tone would involve a specific tonal change on a particular word or syllable. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Korafe,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The text mentions that in declarative sentences, the final syllable of the verb is pronounced with a falling pitch and may even be devoiced. However, in polar questions, this syllable is often lengthened and distinctively terminates the intonation contour to which it belongs. This indicates that intonation plays a crucial role in forming polar questions.
   - Additionally, the text states that polar questions terminate at a much higher pitch than declarative sentences, suggesting that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided text about changing the word order to form polar questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - The text does not mention any clause-initial question particles used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The text mentions that polar interrogative sentences often terminate with one or two tag words: ""ai?"" ('yes?') or ""ai tefa?"" ('yes or no?'). These tag words appear at the end of the clause.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of any clause-medial question particles in the provided text.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The text does not mention any specific verbal morphology (such as suffixes or prefixes) that marks a verb as interrogative.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - The text discusses intonation patterns but does not mention tone as a grammatical feature that distinguishes polar questions from declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, we can code this strategy as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - The grammar explicitly mentions that neutral yes-no questions in Alamblak are marked by a specific intonation pattern. This pattern involves sustaining a high-level pitch terminated by a down-skip to a low-level pitch (Paragraph 109, Example 124). This indicates that intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about changing word order to form polar questions. The focus is on intonation patterns.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of any clause-initial question particles for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of any clause-final question particles for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of any clause-medial question particles for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of any interrogative verb morphology for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions. The discussion is centered around intonation patterns.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
I'saka,"Based on the provided paragraph, there is no information regarding the strategies for forming polar questions in the I'saka language. The paragraph primarily discusses phonological aspects, such as segmental phonemes, suprasegmental features, and phonotactic constraints, but does not address the formation of polar questions.

Given the lack of relevant information in the paragraph, we must code all strategies as 0.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of intonation for forming polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no information on whether word order changes are used to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention any clause-initial question particles.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of clause-final question particles.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The paragraph does not discuss any clause-medial question particles.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no information on verb morphology related to polar questions.
7. **Tone**: While the paragraph discusses tonal environments, it does not mention the use of tone specifically for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being the sole marker for polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no evidence in the provided text that suggests a change in word order is used to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication that verb morphology is used to mark polar questions.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

However, there is a specific construction that uses the particle ""aki"" at the end of the clause, which can be interpreted as a clause-final question particle. This is evident in the examples:

- ""Kipm pa wakg ur kol men kil aki?"" ('Do you have a fire like we here?')
- ""Kitn wor waiken-ketn, aki?"" ('Do you feel a little better?')

Given this evidence, we can conclude that Urim uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention that polar questions can be formed by intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""pankaw"" appears clause-finally in example (140) to form a polar question. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""pankaw"" can also appear in the middle of the clause, as seen in examples (138) and (139). Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:

Chamorro,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chamorro, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly mentions that polar questions can be distinguished from statements merely by question intonation, which is indicated by a sharp final rise. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided text that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The complementizer ""kåo"" (glossed as Q) is mentioned as introducing polar questions. Since ""kåo"" appears at the beginning of the clause, this strategy is present.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from statements. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Awtuw,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that yes-no questions in Awtuw are distinguished from declarative clauses by a change in intonation contour. Specifically, the last word stress in the clause is appreciably higher in pitch, and the pitch of any syllables following that stressed syllable falls markedly. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text mentions that constituents in a yes-no question have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence. This implies that word order does not change to form polar questions, so this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. The particle ""yokri"" is mentioned, but it cannot occur clause-initially.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""yokri"" is mentioned as frequently occurring clause-finally in yes-no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""yokri"" can also occur clause-medially, focusing the constituent it follows. Therefore, this strategy is also present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. The examples given do not show any verb morphology changes to indicate a question.

7. **Tone**: The text describes a change in intonation contour (specifically pitch) for forming yes-no questions, but this is different from lexical or grammatical tone marking. Therefore, tone as a strategy is not used.

### Conclusion

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mian,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text mentions that polar questions in Mian are characterized by a specific intonational pattern, but this intonation is not the sole marker of a polar question. Instead, it accompanies other markers like the interrogative clitic `=a` or the word `bleka`. Therefore, intonation alone is not sufficient to form a polar question.
   - **Code**: 0

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text explicitly states that constituent order does not change in questions. Therefore, word order is not used to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - **Code**: 0

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic `=a` is used at the end of the sentence to form polar questions. Additionally, the word `bleka` can also appear at the end of the sentence to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic `m` can appear in the middle of the clause, typically encliticizing to the final constituent before the predicate. It can also appear clause-initially, but its primary position is clause-medial.
   - **Code**: 1

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. The interrogative clitic `=a` attaches to the verb, but this does not constitute verb morphology as it can also attach to non-verbal predicates.
   - **Code**: 0

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone alone to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences.
   - **Code**: 0

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chácobo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that ""Interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation to my knowledge."" Therefore, this strategy is absent.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. Thus, this strategy is not indicated.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text mentions the use of the morpheme ""ní"" in non-verbal predicate constructions, which occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject. This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text provides multiple examples of interrogative morphemes that are attached to the verb, such as ""=ʔiní"" (interrogative non-past), ""=ʔá"" (interrogative past), ""=ʔaí"" (interrogative non-past, second person singular), and ""=ní"" (interrogative, remote past). This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraph, we do not have sufficient information to determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Hup. The paragraph discusses the Nonvisual marker =hç‚ and its placement within the clause, but it does not provide any information about how polar questions are formed.

To determine the strategies for forming polar questions, we would need specific information about whether Hup uses intonation, word order, particles, verb morphology, or tone to indicate polar questions. Since this information is not present in the paragraph, we must code all strategies as 0.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Interrogative intonation only:** The paragraph does not mention intonation as a means of forming polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order:** The paragraph does not discuss any changes in word order for forming polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle:** There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology:** The paragraph does not discuss any verb morphology specific to polar questions.
7. **Tone:** There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

**Conclusion:**
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",interrogative word order,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Kwaza,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Kwaza, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The interrogative mood marker ""-re"" is attached to the verb, as seen in examples (1330) to (1335). This marker is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating that interrogative verb morphology is used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The paragraph mentions that when person and interrogative mood inflection are omitted, there is a notable rise of intonation on the last syllable of the interrogative verb, as seen in example (1336). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.

The other strategies are not mentioned or indicated in the provided paragraph. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. Thus, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative marker =ka is mentioned, but there is no indication that it appears at the beginning of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative marker =ka can occur in various positions, including before the copula clitics, but there is no specific mention of it being clause-final. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative marker =ka is described as attaching to various parts of speech, including nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs. This suggests that it can appear in the middle of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is confirmed.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

### Conclusion:

Cocama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The grammar mentions that polar questions can be indicated only by prosody, with a specific intonation contour described as ""slowly ascendant pitch plus abrupt rising at the end"" (see examples in (109)). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - The grammar describes a strategy involving subject-verb inversion to indicate polar questions (see examples in (111) and (112)). This inversion is different from the fronting required by the interrogative particle =tipa.
   - **Code: 1**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The interrogative particle =tipa is described as attaching to the end of the questioned element, which can be any constituent in the clause. This includes clause-final positions (see examples in (103), (104), (105), (106), and (108)).
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The interrogative particle =tipa can attach to any constituent within the clause, including medial positions (see examples in (105) and (106)).
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided text.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:

Tiriyo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Tiriyo, we can identify the strategy used for forming polar questions in the language. The paragraph explicitly mentions that yes/no questions are characterized mostly by rising intonation. This indicates that the primary strategy for forming polar questions in Tiriyo is through interrogative intonation only.

The paragraph does not mention any other strategies such as changes in word order, the use of clause-initial, clause-final, or clause-medial question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone changes specific to polar questions.

Ticuna,"### Reasoning:

**Paragraph 1:**
- The example (458) shows a polar question formed with the indicative inflectional type (ind) and the particle ""ná="".
- The particle ""ná="" appears to be clause-medial, as it is attached to the verb ""dăwēnǖ"" (watch).

**Paragraph 2:**
- The example (486) shows a polar question formed with the subjunctive inflectional type (sbjv-ʼü̃́) and the particle ""-ʼü̃́"".
- The particle ""-ʼü̃́"" appears to be clause-final, as it is attached to the end of the verb ""mê-ʼü̃́"" (be good).

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that polar questions in Murui are formed by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a polar question. Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar does not mention any changes in word order for forming polar questions. It explicitly states that the morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of a declarative clause. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar mentions an optional omission of the verb inflection for the 3rd person in polar questions, but this is not a morpheme added to the verb to mark interrogation. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iquito,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that ""Yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito. The only difference resides in the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, with yes-no questions displaying a rising pattern."" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph mentions that yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same, implying that there is no change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to mark polar questions, only intonation.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can deduce the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 (2.8.5. Intonation) explicitly states that ""Interrogative utterances, in contrast, are stressed in a fixed position and are also marked by intonation."" The basic stress and intonation rule for a yes/no question involves a specific pattern of high and mid tones, which marks the utterance as a question.
   - Paragraph 3 (7.14. Questions and answers) confirms that ""A yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation.""

   Therefore, Movima uses interrogative intonation to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions. The focus is on intonation patterns rather than syntactic rearrangements.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of using verb morphology to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 (2.8.4. Tone) states that there is no lexical tone in Movima. However, tone (intonation) plays a role at the utterance level to mark interrogative sentences. Since the guideline specifies that tone marking should be distinct from intonation and bound to a certain position in the clause, and Movima uses intonation rather than lexical tone, this strategy does not apply.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can extract the following information regarding the formation of polar (yes/no) questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that questions are spoken with the same intonation as declaratives. Therefore, intonation alone does not mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided do not indicate any reordering of constituents to signal a question.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph mentions that yes/no questions are formed by starting them with a ‘yes/no’. This suggests the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph mentions that there may be tone changes, but it does not provide sufficient information to conclude that tone alone marks polar questions. Therefore, without further details, we cannot code this as 1.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-initial question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text states that ""Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives."" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   
2. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text mentions the use of the sentence-final particle ""quem"" in yes-no questions, as seen in example (6): ""Pa' ma hwam ma' quem?"" ('Did you kill fish?'). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

3. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

4. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not indicate that tone alone (distinct from intonation) is used to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aymara (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions can be formed by intonation alone. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraphs do not mention a clause-final question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraphs indicate that the suffix **-ti** is used to form polar questions. This suffix is attached to the verb, marking it as interrogative verb morphology. For example, ""utjtati?"" (Do you live here?) and ""Pedrojj utanquiti?"" (Is Pedro at home?).

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Trumai,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph states that it is possible to express interrogation without the use of the enclitic ""a"" by changing the intonational contour of the clause. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraph. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" is mentioned as occurring after the element under interrogation, not at the beginning of the clause. Thus, this strategy is not used.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" can occur at the end of the clause, as seen in examples (1) through (4). This indicates that a clause-final question particle is used.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" can follow any constituent under interrogation, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the middle. Therefore, this strategy is also used.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of a specific morpheme attached to the verb to indicate a polar question. Thus, this strategy is not used.
   
7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to mark polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that a change in intonational contour can indicate a question.
- **Clause-final question particle**: Examples show the enclitic ""a"" at the end of the clause.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" can follow various constituents within the clause, indicating its flexibility in position.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Apinayé, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The text states that ""Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern."" This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The structure remains the same as declarative clauses.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The paragraph mentions a positional clitic ""c\o"" (alternative form ""c\o"", depending on the speaker) that introduces the question at absolute clause-initial position.
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The clitic ""c\o"" is specifically mentioned to occur at the absolute clause-initial position, not in the middle of the clause.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a polar question.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - The text does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not mention that intonation alone is sufficient to mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication in the provided text that word order alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The text does not mention any clause-initial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text does not mention any clause-final question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not mention any clause-medial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions the use of the suffix ""-viy"" attached to the verb to form polar questions (e.g., ""Jidyeetuviy jQnaachara?"" meaning ""Is it your daughter that is always crying?""). This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Cacua,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of interrogative intonation being the sole marker for polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not indicate that a change in word order is used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur clause-finally, as seen in examples like (59) and (60). However, it is not restricted to the clause-final position. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial positions, as seen in examples like (59) and (60). Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:

Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes/no questions in Yuracare are structurally similar to declarative sentences and differ mainly in pitch. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions. The clause-final stressed syllable gets a higher pitch, which is a clear marker of interrogative intonation.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The grammar mentions that the clause-final stressed syllable gets a higher pitch in yes/no questions, but this is described as a change in pitch (intonation) rather than a change in tone on a specific word or syllable. Therefore, this does not qualify as tonal marking.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Kuna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that questions and answers in Kuna have different intonation patterns. Specifically, it mentions that the pitch of a question is higher than that of a statement, and the last word of a question has an even higher pitch that falls off quickly. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Kuna to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar states that the actual order of words in a yes/no question is the same as for a statement. Therefore, interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Kuna.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: The grammar discusses intonation patterns rather than tone. Intonation involves variations in pitch across sentences and phrases, while tone involves pitch variations on specific syllables or words. Since the grammar focuses on intonation patterns, tone is not a strategy used in Kuna.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Uru,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The grammar does not mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is a mention of a tendency for OSV word order in yes/no questions without the question bound topic marker -xwi (example 50 and 54). This suggests that word order can be used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 1.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The grammar does not mention any clause-initial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The grammar does not mention any clause-final question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The grammar does not mention any clause-medial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The grammar does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Camsá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text states that ""Yes/no questions can have any order,"" indicating that word order is not a distinguishing feature for polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions that yes/no questions often end with the tag ""aiñe o ndoñ"" (‘yes or no?’) and also with the particle ""ka."" This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions that the verb ""jan"" shows different morphology in questions compared to the usual affirmative form. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Warao,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text mentions that rising intonation is associated with questioning, but it also states that the interrogative marker -ra 'INTERROG' is obligatory. Therefore, intonation alone is not sufficient to mark a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text explicitly states that yes/no questions in Warao do not involve a change in constituent order from declarative sentences. Hence, word order is not used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative marker -ra 'INTERROG' is described as a sentence-final verb suffix, which indicates that it functions as a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative marker -ra 'INTERROG' is described as a suffix that attaches to the verb, making it a form of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to mark polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: 0 (Intonation is associated with questioning but is not sufficient alone; the interrogative marker -ra is obligatory.)
- **Interrogative word order**: 0 (No change in word order is used to form polar questions.)
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0 (No mention of a clause-initial question particle.)
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1 (The interrogative marker -ra functions as a clause-final question particle.)
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0 (No mention of a clause-medial question particle.)
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 1 (The interrogative marker -ra is a suffix that attaches to the verb.)

Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Cuiba, there is no explicit information regarding the strategies for forming polar questions. The paragraph mainly discusses the distribution and examples of goal clitics and adjectives, but it does not address how polar questions are formed in Cuiba.

Given the absence of relevant data on polar question formation strategies, we must code all strategies as 0.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation being used to form polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no information on whether word order changes to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that polar questions in Apurinã are marked prosodically by rising intonation. This indicates that changing the intonation alone can form a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as their declarative counterparts.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph mentions that in the Fortaleza village, a morpheme ""-ta"" is used in the verb base to mark polar questions. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology in at least one speech variety of Apurinã.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraph.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kadiwéu,"Based on the provided paragraph from the Kadiwéu descriptive grammar, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not provide any information about whether Kadiwéu uses interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph does not mention any changes in word order to form polar questions. It only discusses the movement of interrogative phrases in wh-questions.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph does not provide any information about the use of interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions.
   
7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not provide any information about the use of tone to form polar questions.

The paragraph mainly discusses wh-questions and does not provide explicit information about the formation of polar questions. Therefore, we must conclude that the grammar does not mention any of the strategies for forming polar questions.

**Conclusion:**
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order is used to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative morpheme ""ado)èbo"" (♀) or ""ao)èbo"" (♂) is described as a second-position clitic, which can be situated after the first constituent of the clause. This suggests that it can appear in a medial position within the clause.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
