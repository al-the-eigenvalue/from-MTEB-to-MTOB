Ma'di,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that yes-no questions have the syntax of declarative sentences with a final rising tone. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Paragraph 15 also confirms that a final rising tone can turn a declarative sentence into a yes-no question.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 9 mentions a construction where a 'subordinate' clause is unembedded, with the rising intonation typical of yes-no questions, but it does not specify a clause-final question particle.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that an uninflected verb must always be followed by something in the sentence, but it does not specify interrogative verb morphology.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that it is possible to have a high tone on yes-no questions, especially when repeating what has been said or for emphasis. However, this seems to be more about intonation rather than lexical or grammatical tone.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",tone,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Gumuz,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 7 mentions that a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question in NoG. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - **Conclusion**: 1

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 mention the Yes/No question clitic /=ác/ in Sirba Abay and /=áj/ in Kamashi, which are clause-final.
   - **Conclusion**: 1

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - The Yes/No question clitic /=ác/ or /=áj/ is specifically mentioned as clause-final. There is no evidence that it can occur clause-medially.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 7 indicates that in SoG, one must add the Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause, and it can be attached to the verb. However, this is a clitic and not strictly bound to the verb only.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

7. **Tone**: 
   - There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

### Conclusion:

Seme,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the relevant information about the strategies used to form polar questions in the language Seme. Let's analyze the paragraphs in detail:

1. **Paragraph 3**:
   - This paragraph explicitly mentions that yes-no questions are marked with a clause-final interrogative particle, **á**.
   - Example: ""À ri le dì á?"" translates to ""Did s/he eat?"" where **á** is the clause-final question particle.

2. **Paragraph 6**:
   - This paragraph mentions that the emphatic particle **nâ** and the polar question particle **á** do not co-occur, reinforcing the presence of the clause-final question particle **á**.

3. **Paragraph 12**:
   - This paragraph provides an example of a polar question: ""À ri gbɛ-a?"" which translates to ""Will you have a drink?"" Here, the question is formed without any additional particles, suggesting the possibility of interrogative intonation.

4. **Paragraph 20**:
   - This paragraph does not provide direct information about polar questions but discusses the use of tense and aspect markers in sentences.

From the above analysis, we can conclude the following strategies for forming polar questions in Seme:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is an example where a question is formed without any additional particles, suggesting the use of interrogative intonation.
2. **Clause-final question particle**: The presence of the clause-final question particle **á** is explicitly mentioned.

Tima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of strategies for forming polar questions in Tima. The paragraphs primarily focus on negation, verb morphology, tense, aspect, mood, and other grammatical features, but they do not provide information on how polar questions are formed. 

Here is the analysis of each paragraph:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Discusses negative constructions, not relevant to polar questions.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Provides examples of negation in declarative sentences.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Further details on negation in declarative sentences.
4. **Paragraph 4**: Discusses negation as a mood type and strategies of sentence negation.
5. **Paragraph 5**: Talks about verb aspects and their formation.
6. **Paragraph 6**: Examples of negative perfective aspect.
7. **Paragraph 7**: Discusses different types of negation marking.

16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses verb structure and morphological categories.
17. **Paragraph 17**: Examples of numerals and their usage.
18. **Paragraph 18**: Mentions interrogative mood marked by a particle on the verb or in the final position of a clause.
19. **Paragraph 19**: Discusses the order of numerals and nouns.
20. **Paragraph 20**: Discusses noun marking and pluralization.

Only **Paragraph 18** briefly mentions that the interrogative mood is marked by a particle on the verb or in the final position of a clause. However, it does not provide specific examples or detailed descriptions of how polar questions are formed using this strategy.

Given the lack of explicit information on polar question formation, we must conclude that the grammar does not provide sufficient data to determine the strategies used in Tima.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, the following observations can be made regarding the formation of polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly mentions that Sidaama uses intonation for questions without any suffix. This indicates that polar questions can be formed by changing the intonation alone.
   - Paragraph 20 further supports this by describing how intonation differentiates sentence types, including non-WH-questions, which are indicated by an intonation pattern different from their declarative counterparts.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Sidaama forms polar questions by changing the word order. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Sidaama uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions a question suffix -ni, but it is noted as ungrammatical by the consultant. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Sidaama uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:

Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takes sentence-final position and has raised intonation. This suggests that intonation plays a role in forming polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that a polar question in Mursi can be formed by raising the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at the end of a clause.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 indicates that the syntactic order of constituents in declarative sentences and polar questions are exactly the same. This implies that word order does not change to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that a polar question can be formed by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement. This suggests the presence of clause-final particles that can mark polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that intransitive verbs in polar questions can have a high pitch level, suggesting that tone might play a role in forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Mursi are as follows:
- **Interrogative intonation only: 1**
- **Interrogative word order: 0**
- **Clause-initial question particle: 0**
- **Clause-final question particle: 1**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 indicate that polar questions in Majang can be formed by a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause. This rising tone is sufficient to mark a sentence as a polar question.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**: 
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order is used to form polar questions in Majang.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: 
   - Paragraphs 3 and 4 mention question markers like ""joː"" and ""kíː"", but they do not specify that these particles appear at the beginning of the clause. Instead, they seem to be used in various positions.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**: 
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that the question marker ""joː"" always comes at the end of a question. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: 
   - Paragraphs 3 and 4 indicate that question markers like ""joː"" and ""kíː"" can be used in polar questions, but there is no clear evidence that they are used clause-medially.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: 
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that interrogative verb morphology is used to form polar questions in Majang.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**: 
   - The paragraphs do not indicate that tone alone (distinct from intonation) is used to form polar questions. The rising sentence tone mentioned is part of intonation rather than a lexical or grammatical tone change.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Igbo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Igbo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 11 mentions that noun phrases can be pronounced with a higher pitch to indicate a question, suggesting that intonation alone can mark polar questions. This implies that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Igbo.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no explicit mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Igbo uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Igbo uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Igbo uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 19 discusses the use of a floating low tone realized on a verbal prefix or pronoun to mark polar questions, which can be considered a form of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: Paragraphs 3 and 10 mention that low tone pronouns and tonal modifications are used to mark polar questions, indicating that tone is a strategy used in Igbo.

Based on this analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Igbo are as follows:

Mambai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mambai, the following strategies for forming polar questions can be identified:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The question particle ""nà"" is mentioned multiple times as appearing at the end of the clause to form questions. For example, in Paragraph 2, ""víí Ø húmgò nà"" translates to ""who comes? / who is coming?"" and in Paragraph 5, ""mù té’là nà"" translates to ""are you walking?"".

2. **Clause-medial question particle**: The question particle ""nà"" can also appear in positions other than the end of the clause, as seen in Paragraph 4, where it is combined with other particles and appears in the middle of the clause: ""mì té’là nà"" translates to ""do I always walk? / am I always walking?"".

3. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of intonation alone being sufficient to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

4. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

5. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a question particle appearing at the beginning of the clause. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

Wambaya,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence but are said with a rising, questioning intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""Gajbi murnd-u yana manganyma?"" (Can we eat some of this food?)

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Wambaya.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used to form polar questions in Wambaya.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-final question particle is used to form polar questions in Wambaya.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of an interrogative particle ""gayi"" in some dialects, which can appear in the auxiliary or alone in the second position in a verbless clause. This suggests that it can be clause-medial.
   - Example: ""Duditiarri gayi-ny-u iniyawulu?"" (What, you are spearing them?)

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that interrogative verb morphology is used to form polar questions in Wambaya.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone (distinct from intonation) is used to form polar questions in Wambaya.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Wagiman,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 12 mention that polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical to declarative sentences but differ in their intonation contour. Specifically, polar questions have a generally rising intonation over the final syllables, whereas declaratives have a generally falling final intonation contour.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Wagiman.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that word order changes to form polar questions. It is explicitly stated that major constituent order is unaffected in polar interrogative sentences.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that clause-initial question particle is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 9 mentions the tag form ""gale,"" which occurs commonly in final position in questions and has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the question by the addressee. However, it is used as a tag question form, which is typically not considered a neutral polar question.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that clause-final question particle is not a strategy used in Wagiman for neutral polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that clause-medial question particle is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of interrogative verb morphology being used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that interrogative verb morphology is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that tone is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Korean. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that questions can be formed using the statement form with appropriate intonation: ""Use the Statement form, with the appropriate intonation: Poo? 'Do you see it?'; Pn'lss.so'.''Did you see it?'; Pokeyss.so? 'Will we see it?'; Coh.so? or C$h'ui? 'Is it good?'; Cip io? 'Is it a house?'""
   - Paragraph 8 also supports this by stating that when the interrogation is otherwise unmarked in speech, a rising intonation indicates a question.
   - Paragraph 11 further confirms that intonation is used to indicate questions: ""The meaning of statement, question, suggestion, and command are sometimes carried (in whole or in part) by the intonation.""

   Therefore, **Interrogative intonation only** is present.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Korean uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

   Therefore, **Interrogative word order** is absent.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle being used in Korean.

   Therefore, **Clause-initial question particle** is absent.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions the final postmodifier ""yl"" in ""-(ha)nun yu,"" and the interrogative ending ""-(su)p.nikka"" in ""-hap.nikka.""
   - Paragraph 7 also mentions the formal retrospective attentive ending ""-suptikka/-ptikka"" for forming questions.

   Therefore, **Clause-final question particle** is present.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used in Korean.

   Therefore, **Clause-medial question particle** is absent.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions the interrogative ending ""-(su)p.nikka"" and ""-hap.nikka,"" which are attached to the verb.
   - Paragraph 7 also mentions the formal retrospective attentive ending ""-suptikka/-ptikka"" attached to the verb.

   Therefore, **Interrogative verb morphology** is present.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to form polar questions in Korean.

   Therefore, **Tone** is absent.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Basque,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 11 mentions that yes/no questions need not be signaled by any mark other than interrogative intonation: 
     - Example: ""Jonek liburu hori irakurri du?"" ('Has Jon read that book?')
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 11 also discusses verb fronting as a syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions:
     - Example: ""Esango al zeniguke zerbait azkenik?"" ('Would you tell us something finally?')
   - This suggests that changing the word order (specifically, fronting the verb) can mark polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 11 mentions the use of the particle ""al"" in yes/no questions, which can appear clause-finally:
     - Example: ""Baretuko ote lituzke zertxobait erdal-euskal hiztegi batek eztabaidak?"" ('Would a Spanish-Basque dictionary appease the controversies a bit?')
   - This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 11 also shows that the particle ""al"" can appear in a medial position:
     - Example: ""Esango al zeniguke zerbait azkenik?"" ('Would you tell us something finally?')
   - This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no explicit mention of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1:**
- Mentions that a sentence is transformed into a question by the addition of a suffix, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

**Paragraph 2:**
- States that sentences are transformed into questions by the addition of the interrogative suffix ""-oo"". This confirms the use of interrogative verb morphology.

**Paragraph 3:**
- Mentions the addition of the negative question form and an emphatic particle, but this does not provide information about neutral polar questions.

**Paragraph 4 to Paragraph 20:**
- These paragraphs discuss various exercises and instructions related to forming questions, responding to questions, and transforming sentences. However, they do not provide specific information about the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions.

From the information provided, we can conclude that the primary strategy for forming polar questions in Malayalam is through the use of interrogative verb morphology, specifically the addition of the suffix ""-oo"".

### Conclusion:

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of ""beh"" as a clause-final tag forming an alternative question with the meaning 'or not?'. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: ""ma=ldn, beh?"" (Would you want to, or not?)

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 7 mentions the morpheme ""tah"" following the verb, indicating it can occur in the middle of the clause. This suggests the presence of a clause-medial question particle.
   - Example: ""bos ?no?no??"" khUn ""sak tah ?"" khl*i) (Aren't you going to perhaps peel this sugar cane?"" he asked.)

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions the proclitic ""ma="" forming an interrogative when attached to the verb, indicating interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""tan Ian ma=brus?"" (How many times do I need to scrub it?)

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

**Conclusion:**

Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that ordinary polar questions (yes-no questions) in Yukaghir are not marked morphologically but are expressed only by a rising intonation contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Yukaghir.
   - Example from Paragraph 2: 
     - (815)a. éolhore, hare Golhoral’e-jek? hare be-INTR:28G ‘Hare, hare, are you here?’
     - (815)b. gar something leg-u-te-l-ben eat-0-FUT-ANR-RELNR num-mek? find-TR:2SG ‘Have you found something to eat?’

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order is used to form polar questions in Yukaghir. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences, with the interrogative meaning conveyed through intonation.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Yukaghir uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Yukaghir uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Yukaghir uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that the ordinary polar question is not marked morphologically, indicating that there is no specific interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions in Yukaghir.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone (distinct from intonation) is used to form polar questions in Yukaghir.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Georgian,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Georgian, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Georgian. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 (5.1.13.1) states: ""Questions of this type involve no movement of words but are signalled entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a rise-falling pitch on the final syllable of the verb, which will normally be the last word in the sentence.""
   - This clearly indicates that polar questions in Georgian can be formed using interrogative intonation only.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Georgian. The grammar explicitly states that intonation is used without word movement.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to form polar questions.

**Conclusion:**
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Thai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Thai, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Thai:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions can be formed using intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Thai. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraphs mention the use of ""CHY MY"" and ""REU"" at the end of sentences to form questions. For example, ""WUN NEE WUN SOOK CHY MY"" (Is today Friday?) and ""NAI CHIT YOO TEENEE REU PLOW"" (Does Nai Chit live here, or not?). This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Nganasan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nganasan, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation, with a high-pitch intonation pattern. This indicates that intonation alone can mark polar questions in the absence of a verb.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative intonation only: 1**.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that word order does not play a fundamental role in forming polar questions. The word order is usually the same as in declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative word order: 0**.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-initial question particle: 0**.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-final question particle: 0**.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-medial question particle: 0**.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that if an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatorily takes the interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses.
   - Paragraph 15 provides examples of verbs with interrogative markers in different tenses.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative verb morphology: 1**.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Tone: 0**.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. Thus, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence from the paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide examples of a question particle ""-ηa"" or ""-ḑ-ηa"" appearing at the end of the clause. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Thus, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no clear evidence from the provided paragraphs that a clause-medial question particle is used. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no indication that polar questions are formed by adding a morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb only. Thus, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

**Conclusion**: 
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Jarawa (in Andamans),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. The examples provided show the use of a question particle rather than a change in word order. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraphs clearly indicate that the interrogative marker ""ka"" is used at the beginning of yes/no questions (e.g., Paragraph 4: ""In first type, the interrogative marker ka is used at the beginning of the sentence""). Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative marker ""ka"" is described as being used at the beginning of the clause and sometimes in between constituents (e.g., Paragraph 7: ""There is one example in the corpus which shows that the question particle may be used in between the noun phrase and the question word""). Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Udihe as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraphs 1 and 13 explicitly state that yes-no questions in Udihe are differentiated from declarative sentences by intonational patterns, specifically a higher and more prolonged intonational contour on the last word. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: Paragraph 1 mentions that yes-no questions are not marked by changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. This indicates that interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Udihe.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions in Udihe.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-final question particle being used to form polar questions in Udihe.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions in Udihe.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of interrogative verb morphology being used to form polar questions in Udihe.

7. **Tone**: The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (as distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions in Udihe.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions in Ingush can be formed using intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraphs do not indicate that changing word order alone can form polar questions. Instead, the presence of the interrogative clitic =ii is necessary. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =ii appears to be attached to the verb and is not described as a clause-final particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =ii is attached to the verb and not described as a clause-medial particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =ii is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating interrogative verb morphology. This is explicitly mentioned in Paragraph 2, where the verb is followed by the interrogative clitic =ii. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that if the question expresses surprise or doubt, the interrogative affix may be omitted, and the interrogative meaning is then expressed only by the intonation (rising on the finite verb form). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions in certain contexts.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Interrogative intonation only"".

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same, and the interrogative mood affix -ni is used instead.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Interrogative word order"".

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 mentions the sentence-initial particle ""bes"" which is used in questions. However, it often conveys the speaker's expectation of a negative answer, which is more characteristic of leading questions rather than neutral polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-initial question particle"".

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. The interrogative mood affix -ni is used instead.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-final question particle"".

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. The interrogative mood affix -ni is used instead.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-medial question particle"".

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 clearly states that ordinary polar questions are marked by the interrogative mood affix -ni on the finite verb of the sentence. This affix is phonologically bound to the verb.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Interrogative verb morphology"".

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The interrogative mood affix -ni and intonation are mentioned instead.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Tone"".

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Galo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can identify the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention that polar questions can be formed using intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The grammar does not mention any clause-initial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of clause-final interrogative particles such as ""ree"" (PQ) and ""larèe"" (DUB) to form polar questions (e.g., ""nó galôə rè?"" meaning ""Are you (a) Galo?""). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The grammar does not mention any clause-medial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar mentions the use of preferred inflections for polar questions, such as the Experiential perfect ""-bée"" and the Stative ""-dó(o)"" (e.g., ""nó acín dobbê?"" meaning ""Have you eaten (yet)?""). Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 12 mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle, as in ""Tekit-úq? # Nuk’aq?"" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains consistent with declarative sentences.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 7 explicitly states that a sentence-initial ""qaa"" (as *TDDXLWD-lar-tuci ma-a-ni?) is unacceptable. This indicates that ""qaa"" does not appear clause-initially.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7 both describe the use of the particle ""qaa"" as a polar question marker, which is typically appended to the first word of the clause, forming a bound phrase. However, it is not described as a clause-final particle.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The particle ""qaa"" is described as being appended to the first word of the clause, forming a bound phrase. This does not fit the definition of a clause-medial particle.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and are characterized by the rhetorical question particle ""qaa."" This indicates that interrogative verb morphology is not used for polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences. The focus is on intonation rather than tone.

Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only:**
   - There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions can be formed by intonation alone. The examples and descriptions focus on morphological markers rather than intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - The paragraphs do not indicate that word order changes are used to form polar questions. The examples provided show consistent verb-final order without any mention of reordering for questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle:**
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. The examples show that the interrogative marker is attached to the verb.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle:**
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle. The interrogative marker appears to be a suffix attached to the verb rather than a separate particle at the end of the clause.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle:**
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. The interrogative marker is consistently shown as a suffix on the verb.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology:**
   - The provided paragraphs clearly indicate that polar questions are formed by adding the interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) or its allomorphs to the verb. This is evident in multiple examples where the suffix -ha is used to form questions (e.g., ""kiˀ mat-tl-ha"" for ""Why did you do that?"").

7. **Tone:**
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. The focus is on morphological markers rather than tonal changes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Yuki are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only:** 0

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-medial question particles in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text provides evidence of interrogative verb morphology. For instance, the suffix ""-ga"" is used in examples like ""yaxa-'-ga-' did you eat?"" and ""hedjw'ed ma'ga-no- -ga why are you crying?"". This indicates that interrogative verb morphology is used to form polar questions.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Tunica,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tunica, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of rising melody in the example ""lo’ta wiwa’ndn (16:h) ‘Do you want to run?” This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 1 for this strategy.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 13 mentions the interrogative postfix ""-n"" which follows other postfixes, indicating it can appear at the end of the clause, e.g., ""ka’ 2a, ya'k?tk?ahéan. (11B:b) When will you come back?""
   - Therefore, code 1 for this strategy.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no specific mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 13 discusses the interrogative postfix ""-n"" which is added to verbs to form questions, e.g., ""?unpo'?ehén.(13:ag) Didn’t you see them?""
   - Therefore, code 1 for this strategy.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Wappo,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wappo, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no information suggesting that Wappo uses a change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 11 mentions the use of ""-ya"" as an interrogative suffix attached to verbs (e.g., ""ika, what!; mi, you; -we apparently meaningless emphatic suffix; -ya interrogative suffix""). This indicates that Wappo uses interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Reasoning:
The only strategy explicitly mentioned in the provided paragraphs is the use of an interrogative suffix ""-ya"" attached to verbs, which falls under interrogative verb morphology.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Ute,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ute, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not provide explicit information about whether intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraphs do not mention any clause-initial question particles. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 12 mentions the use of the interrogative enclitic ""-ru'a-"" which can follow pronominal enclitics and is used in rhetorical questions. This suggests that Ute uses a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative enclitic ""-ru'a-"" can follow pronominal enclitics, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the clause-final position. This indicates that Ute uses a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 12 provides examples of interrogative enclitics attached to verbs, such as ""imi'ntcu'aq• 'iy'ir ivi'yu"" (thou-interrogative-it (vis.) indeed drink-momentaneous, you did drink it). This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-medial question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Yurok,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yurok, we can determine the strategies for forming neutral polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
2. **Interrogative word order**: Paragraph 1 mentions that Yurok forms yes-no questions differently from content questions, but it does not specify that word order alone is used to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 2 states that the question particle ""hes"" is most commonly positioned after the first word or phrase of the sentence. This does not indicate a clause-initial position. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 16 mentions that ""hes"" can also be positioned at the end of the sentence, although this is less common. This confirms the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 2 indicates that ""hes"" is most commonly positioned after the first word or phrase of the sentence, which is a clause-medial position. Therefore, this strategy is confirmed.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

### Conclusion

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Nuuchahnulth,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nuuchahnulth, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of forming polar questions using only interrogative intonation in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no indication that Nuuchahnulth uses a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided do not show any reordering of words to indicate a question.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided text that Nuuchahnulth uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided text that Nuuchahnulth uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided text that Nuuchahnulth uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The provided text mentions the use of the interrogative mood clitic <(p)`9j for forming polar questions. This clitic attaches to the first word of the predicate that does not contain an interrogative root to form a yes/no question. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
     - Example: 
       - (418) a. F@chp@j j`a`sr@o
         - F@ch<(p)`9j j`s`sÊr`9o
         - in.fact=POLAR known–CAUS.PERF
         - ‘Do you really know?’
       - (418) b. QtKTp` QtKÊT<(p)`9
         - good–APPEN=POLAR.3sg
         - ‘Is it good?’

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Columbia-Wenatchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information about the formation of polar questions in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin):

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that yes/no questions in Nxa?amxcin are marked by ""sa?"", which is represented as a particle, though its exact status is unclear. This suggests the presence of a question particle.

2. **Paragraph 6** and **Paragraph 14** discuss non-declarative operations, including yes/no questions, but do not provide additional details on the strategies used.

3. **Paragraph 11** lists sections related to non-declarative operations, including yes/no questions, but does not provide specific information on the strategies.

4. **Paragraph 13** and **Paragraph 16** mention non-declarative operations, including yes/no questions, but again, do not provide specific details on the strategies.

From the information provided, we can infer the following:

- **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""sa?"" is mentioned as marking yes/no questions. However, its exact position within the clause is not specified. Given the lack of explicit information about its position, we cannot definitively code this as a clause-initial question particle.
  
- **Clause-final question particle**: Similarly, the particle ""sa?"" is mentioned, but its position is not specified. We cannot definitively code this as a clause-final question particle either.

- **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""sa?"" is mentioned, but its position is not specified. We cannot definitively code this as a clause-medial question particle.

- **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation being used alone to mark polar questions.

- **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of word order changes being used to mark polar questions.

- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of verb morphology being used to mark polar questions.

- **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions.

Given the information, we can only confirm the presence of a question particle without specifying its exact position. Therefore, we will code the strategies as follows:

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Hidatsa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hidatsa, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that context, facial expression, or intonational cues can indicate whether an utterance is a question or a cohortative suggestion. However, it does not explicitly state that intonation alone can form a polar question. Therefore, we cannot conclusively code this as 1.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a change in word order being used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 19 all mention the use of the suffix ""-ˀ"" (glottal stop) attached to the verb to form both content and polar questions. This indicates that interrogative verb morphology is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Toqabaqita:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that the structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of declarative sentences, with the only difference being in the intonation. Declaratives have a falling intonation, while polar interrogatives have a rising intonation towards the end. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: 
     - Declarative: `Qe qako naqa.` ('It [food] is cooked/done now.')
     - Interrogative: `Qe qako naqa?` ('Is it cooked/done now?')

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. The structure remains the same as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (as distinct from intonation) to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 12 mentions that although Aghu has grammaticalized ways of marking a question, there is no information about the role of intonation in question formation. Therefore, we cannot confirm the use of intonation alone for marking polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of changing word order as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Aghu uses a clause-initial question particle.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 18 mention the use of the question particle ""ka"" or ""a xajo"" at the end of the clause to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 18 describe the use of question particles ""ka"" or ""a xajo"" attached to verbs, but these are not phonologically bound to the verb only. They can follow other constituents as well.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Manambu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Manambu, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 states: ""polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural difference between a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context decide.""
   - This clearly indicates that polar questions can be formed using interrogative intonation alone.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions: ""Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses.""
   - This suggests that there is no change in word order to form polar questions, so this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs provided that indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs provided that indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs provided that indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs provided that indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions: ""Questions have a rising intonation, while dependent clauses have intonation contours of their own.""
   - This indicates that intonation (not tone) is used to mark questions. Since tone refers to lexical or grammatical tone changes within words, and not intonation patterns over the whole clause, this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Manambu are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Momu,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Momu, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar interrogatives can be delivered without pause or change in regular declarative intonation. However, it does not explicitly state that intonation alone can mark a polar question. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say that interrogative intonation alone is used.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form a polar question.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 14 mention the use of the marker =fa at the end of the clause to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that the polar interrogative =fa can appear in the middle of a declarative sentence, questioning the identity of a given reference.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that adding a morpheme to the verb alone can form a polar question.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone can mark a polar question.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Makasae,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, the following strategies for forming polar questions are identified:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Makasae can be marked solely by a rising-falling intonation contour. This is evident from the example given and the description of the pitch contour.
   - Example: ""… ei so’ot=ini uerileuk?"" ('… do you want to have (your) bottom drilled?').

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 also states that polar questions can be overtly marked by the clitics =ua and =uai, both of which are attached to the right end of the question.
   - Example: ""Ei hana’e Iliomar isi-la’a=ee ei Makalero lolo=ua?"" ('When you were in Iliomar, did you speak Makalero?').

3. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 6 indicate that the clitic =uai can be used in the middle of the clause as well as at the end. This is evident from the examples and the discussion on the placement of =uai.
   - Example: ""... ani ei asar=ana=po ei to-so’ot=uai na’an?"" ('… I want to send you (somewhere), do you want to do that or not?').

The other strategies are not explicitly mentioned or evidenced in the provided paragraphs:

- **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions.
- **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a particle that appears at the beginning of the clause.
- **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of a morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb to indicate a polar question.
- **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate between declarative and interrogative sentences.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Motuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Motuna, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar interrogative sentences, the final stressed mora has a rising pitch followed by a sharp falling contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions discourse markers ""nee"" and ""nehe"" that play a similar role to tag questions in English and can be placed at the end of a sentence. However, these are described as tag questions, which are considered leading questions, not neutral polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that the final stressed mora in polar interrogative sentences has a rising pitch followed by a sharp falling contour. This is related to intonation rather than tone marking specific words or morphemes.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Lavukaleve,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lavukaleve, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""All questions are marked, not only by syntactic and lexical means, but also by a distinctive rising intonation."" This indicates that intonation is used, but it is not the sole marker for polar questions. Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions are formed by changing the word order. Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 11 mention the use of the focus marker ""meo"" in polar questions. The focus marker ""meo"" does not move to the initial position but remains in the position it would be if the sentence were not a question. This indicates that ""meo"" can appear in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial. Therefore, code 1 for this strategy.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, code 0 for this strategy.

7. **Tone**:

Taulil,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taulil, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly mentions that polar questions can be formed by changing the intonation pattern. Specifically, it describes a pitch change located on the last two syllables, with a penultimate syllable rise in pitch and a slight rise in pitch and elongation of the last syllable.
   - Paragraph 6 further supports this by stating that intonation is the only cue to distinguish a declarative sentence from a polar question, with a steep rise and fall on the last word of the utterance.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order is a strategy for forming polar questions in Taulil.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs distinguish between intonation and tone. The description of polar questions relies on intonation patterns rather than lexical or grammatical tone changes.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Taiap,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Taiap, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being the sole marker for polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Thus, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no indication that changing word order alone can form polar questions. Thus, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Thus, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the clitic =ke, which can appear at the end of the clause to form polar questions (e.g., ""Amani okɨnetke?""). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Thus, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 also shows that the clitic =ke can follow various constituents within the clause, not just at the end (e.g., ""Amanike okɨnet?""). This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle. Thus, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Thus, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Thus, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Kuot,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Yes/no questions have a very distinctive sharp pitch rise on the last syllable.""
   - Paragraph 7 states, ""Yes/no questions are marked only by intonation; primarily a sharp rise on the last syllable.""
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Kuot.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Kuot uses a change in word order to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions a final particle ""a"" which can be added when a positive answer is expected, but this is for leading questions, not neutral polar questions.
   - Paragraph 7 states that polar questions are marked only by intonation.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 7 states that polar questions are marked by a sharp rise in intonation on the last syllable.
   - This is about intonation rather than tone, as tone would involve a specific pitch pattern on a particular word or syllable rather than a general rise in pitch.
   - Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""kai"" is mentioned as a clause particle used to form yes/no questions. It appears at the beginning of the clause in example (20). Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" is used as a question marker and can appear at the end of the clause, as seen in examples (21), (22), and (23). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" can be attached to various parts of speech within the clause, not just at the end, as seen in examples (21) and (23). Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" is attached to the verb to form questions, as seen in examples (21) and (24). Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Not mentioned.
- **Interrogative word order**: Not mentioned.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle ""kai"" is used at the beginning of the clause.
- **Clause-final question particle**: The suffix ""-m(e)"" can appear at the end of the clause.

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that polar questions formed with ""pe"" are indistinguishable from statements like ""possibly..."" and suggests that intonation might distinguish them from statements. However, it is not explicitly confirmed that intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot definitively code this as 1.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mehek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mehek, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the clitic `=ka` used in polar questions, which attaches to the final element in the clause, typically the verb.
   - Paragraph 11 confirms that the primary means of asking a polar question is via the interrogative clitic `=ka`, which attaches to the final element in the clause.
   - Example: ""ru kom=k rusu-ya-r=ka"" (Is he staying in the village?).

2. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 discusses the use of `kamben` or the clitic `=ben` to form polar questions, which can occur in the middle of the clause.
   - Example: ""suwa glengu=r ser ser ana ra=ben"" (Perhaps I will take the coconut pod first?).

3. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that when the subject is second person singular, there is no overt marking of the sentence as a question, but the form of the verb is distinct from that in a corresponding declarative sentence.
   - Example: ""kasukna-ya=ø"" (Are you sleeping?).

4. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that intonation alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

5. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that word order alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

6. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial particle is used to mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone can mark polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the detailed reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that the form ""nala"" can be used in both interrogative and indicative constructions, differentiated by their intonational contour. This suggests that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a question.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Interrogative intonation only"".

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no specific mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form a polar question.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Interrogative word order"".

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-initial question particle"".

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-final question particle"".

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-medial question particle"".

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Interrogative verb morphology"".

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Tone"".

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Arapesh (Abu). Here is the analysis:

### Paragraph 1:
- **Intonation**: The paragraph mentions that one way to form questions is by changing the intonation from a statement's final fall to an abrupt rising intonation. This indicates the use of interrogative intonation only.
- **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph also describes adding ""_ba uwa'_"" (‘or not’) at the end of an indicative sentence to form a question. This suggests the use of a clause-final question particle.

### Paragraph 3:
- **Intonation**: This paragraph reiterates that in the absence of morphological signals of interrogation, the intonation contour features a sharp rise to high pitch on the stressed syllable of the phrase-final syllable, which is maintained. This further supports the use of interrogative intonation only.

### Paragraph 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20:
- These paragraphs do not provide additional relevant information about the formation of polar questions.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly mentions that questions can be formed by changing the intonation from a statement's final fall to an abrupt rising intonation.
2. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar describes adding ""_ba uwa'_"" (‘or not’) at the end of a sentence to form a question, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Korafe often terminate with a distinct intonation contour, which includes a rising pitch. This indicates that intonation plays a significant role in forming polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 further supports this by describing the intonation contours specific to polar questions, which are different from those of declarative sentences.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about changing word order to form polar questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of tag words like ""ai?"" ('yes?') and ""ai tefa?"" ('yes or no?') at the end of polar questions. This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles.
   - Paragraph 16 also mentions the use of ""ai"" and ""ai tefo"" as tag words for polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 discuss the use of specific verb forms and suffixes in questions, but these are related to content questions rather than polar questions. There is no clear indication that verb morphology alone marks polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences. The focus is on intonation rather than tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can extract the following relevant information regarding the formation of polar questions:

1. **Paragraph 1** states that yes/no interrogative clauses are syntactically unmarked for the interrogative feature.
2. **Paragraph 2** mentions that yes/no interrogative clauses are morpho-syntactically indistinguishable from independent declarative clauses and are marked intonationally.
3. **Paragraph 3** reinforces that yes/no questions tend to have a specific intonation, usually a rising intonation.

From these paragraphs, it is clear that Alamblak forms polar questions using **interrogative intonation only**. There is no mention of any other strategies such as interrogative word order, clause-initial, clause-final, or clause-medial question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone marking specifically for polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of I'saka, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions can be formed using intonation alone. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: Paragraph 2 mentions that the word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses, with the interrogative pronoun appearing in the preverbal focus position. However, this is specific to content questions and does not necessarily indicate a strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 16 mentions that there are five clause-final particles covering a range of semantic and grammatical functions, but it does not specify if any of these are used for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed examination of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that the interrogative pronoun ""ahi"" can be derived from the word ""ai"" by adding rising question intonation. This suggests that intonation plays a role in forming questions.
   - Paragraph 11 discusses the use of ""kalpis"" to answer yes/no questions, indicating that intonation might be sufficient for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that interrogative intonation is used in Urim.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Thus, we cannot conclude that interrogative word order is a strategy used in Urim.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used in Urim.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 provides examples where the particle ""pa"" is used at the end of the clause in yes/no questions, such as ""Kitn yul rmpa?"" (Do you have any fish?).
   - This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used in Urim.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:

Abau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abau, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that the intonation contour for the imperfective interrogative speech utterance marker ""o"" starts at a high level falling to mid. This suggests that intonation plays a role in marking questions.
   - Paragraph 15 also discusses the intonation contours over verbs, indicating that intonation is significant in distinguishing between perfective and imperfective aspects, which could extend to interrogative intonation.
   - Paragraph 17 mentions that the interrogative is nearly always marked with a sentence-final speech utterance marker, but it does not exclude the possibility of intonation alone marking questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 provide examples where the clause-final speech utterance markers ""so,"" ""ko,"" and ""mo"" are used to mark questions. This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles.
   - Paragraph 8 further supports this by describing the intonation contours for the perfective speech markers ""so,"" ""ko,"" and ""mo"" in interrogative contexts.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 15 discuss intonation rather than tone. The distinction between intonation and tone is crucial, and the paragraphs focus on intonation contours rather than lexical or grammatical tone changes to form questions.

### Conclusion:

Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 2 explicitly states that yes-no questions in Awtuw are distinguished from declarative clauses by a change in intonation contour. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: Paragraph 2 also mentions that constituents in a yes-no question have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence. This suggests that word order does not change to form polar questions, so this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 2 mentions that the particle ""yokri"" can occur clause-finally in yes-no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 2 also states that ""yokri"" can occur clause-medially, focusing the constituent it follows. This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mian,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that polar questions in Mian are characterized by a specific intonational contour, with a short intonational peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance. This suggests that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar explicitly states that constituent order does not change in questions. Therefore, Mian does not use interrogative word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =m can appear as a free word clause-initially, indicating that Mian can use a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =a encliticizes to the final constituent of the sentence, and the particle bleka ‘or’ can also appear at the end of the sentence to form polar questions. This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =m typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the verb, which can be in various positions within the clause. This suggests that Mian can use clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =a attaches to the verb in verbal predications, but it is not bound exclusively to the verb and can attach to other constituents. Therefore, this does not qualify as interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences in Mian.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation (Paragraph 1). Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions in Chácobo are formed by changing the word order. Therefore, this strategy is not indicated.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Chácobo uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not indicated.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar does not provide evidence of a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not indicated.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of the morpheme =ʔiní for non-past interrogatives, which occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject (Paragraph 1). This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar describes several interrogative morphemes that are bound to the verb, such as =ʔiní for non-past, =ʔá for past, =ʔaí for non-past second person singular, and =ní for remote past (Paragraphs 1, 5). This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone is used to mark polar questions in Chácobo. Therefore, this strategy is not indicated.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause compared to declarative and other Hup clause types. However, it does not explicitly state that intonation alone can mark a polar question. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that interrogative intonation alone is used.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 5 describes that predicate-focused polar questions in Hup involve word order inversion, where the clause is subject-final rather than verb-final. This inversion is a distinctive feature of Hup polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 11 mentions the enclitic =b’ay, which frequently occurs in interrogative clauses and is usually clause-final. This suggests that =b’ay can function as a clause-final question particle in polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 describe the use of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ on the clause-final verb to mark polar questions. This suffix is phonologically bound to the verb, indicating interrogative verb morphology.
   - **Code: 1**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative word order,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kwaza,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions that in the interrogative mood, tone rises at the end of the utterance, and this rise in intonation can be used to form questions, especially when person and interrogative markers are omitted. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Example: ""['wa!a'sasa'4e]"" (‘have you finished?’).

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Kwaza.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions the interrogative mood marker ""-re"" attached to the verb to form questions. This marker appears to be clause-final.
   - Example: ""kui-xa-'re=tja"" (‘they say that you do nothing but drink’).

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 5 discusses the interrogative mood marker ""-re"" attached to verbs to form questions, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""kui-da-'re"" (‘am I (going to) drinking water?’).

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 10 specifies that intonation (rising tone) is used to form questions, but this is different from lexical or grammatical tone marking specific positions in the clause. Hence, tone as a grammatical feature for polar questions is not indicated.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 17 mentions that interrogative utterances do not show a final rising in pitch, but the question word receives the highest level of pitch. This suggests that intonation alone is not sufficient to mark polar questions, as it is tied to the presence of a question word.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form a polar question.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 9 mention the presence of the clitic =pa ‘Question marker’ which can occur in various positions, including clause-final.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 9 mention that the clitic =pa ‘Question marker’ can occur in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

Cocama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that polar questions can be indicated by prosody alone, with a specific intonation contour described as ""slowly ascendant pitch plus abrupt rising at the end."" This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 2 describes subject-verb inversion as a strategy for forming polar questions. The verb is fronted, and the subject follows, without the use of the =tipa marker.
   - **Code: 1**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 describe the use of the morpheme =tipa, which can be attached to the end of the questioned element. This element must be fronted in the clause, making it a second position clitic rather than a clause-final particle.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 describe the morpheme =tipa as a second position clitic, which can attach to the first element in the clause, not necessarily in the middle.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in Murui (Huitoto). Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 (11.2.2 Polar questions) explicitly states that polar questions in Murui are marked by a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate. This indicates that intonation is the primary marker for polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 (11.2 Questions ‒ general characteristics) reiterates that polar questions have a distinct rising-falling intonation pattern.
   - Paragraph 10 (10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics) mentions that questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in their intonation.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative intonation only: 1**.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that word order changes to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative word order: 0**.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-initial question particle: 0**.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-final question particle: 0**.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-medial question particle: 0**.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 (11.2.2 Polar questions) mentions that there is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the 3rd person in polar questions, but this is not a dedicated interrogative morpheme.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative verb morphology: 0**.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs discuss intonation patterns but do not mention tone as a distinct strategy for marking polar questions.
   - Therefore, **Tone: 0**.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

**Paragraph 1:**
- This paragraph explicitly states that yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito, with the only difference being the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, which displays a rising pattern for yes-no questions.
- This indicates the use of ""Interrogative intonation only.""

**Paragraph 2:**
- This paragraph mentions that yes-no questions in Iquito maintain the same SVO word order as declarative sentences.
- This suggests that ""Interrogative word order"" is not used.

**Paragraph 3 to Paragraph 20:**
- These paragraphs do not provide additional information on the strategies for forming polar questions in Iquito. They mainly discuss negation strategies, clause structures, and other unrelated grammatical features.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, Iquito forms polar questions using interrogative intonation only.

Aymara (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, we can identify the following strategies for forming neutral polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that word order alone is used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 1 mentions the suffix ""-ti"" used in interrogative sentences, which is attached to the verb. This suggests that the interrogative marker appears at the end of the clause, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 1 mentions the suffix ""-ti"" used in interrogative sentences, which is attached to the verb. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

### Conclusion:

Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that it is possible to express interrogation without the use of the enclitic ""a"" by changing the intonational contour of the clause. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Paragraph 3 also supports this by stating that interrogation with only a change in intonation has limited use but is possible.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form a polar question. The examples provided do not indicate a change in word order as a strategy for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 clearly states that polar questions require the use of the enclitic ""a,"" which occurs after the element under interrogation. This enclitic can appear at the end of the clause, as shown in examples (1) to (4).
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The enclitic ""a"" can follow the constituent under interrogation, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the middle. This is evident from the examples provided in Paragraph 1.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone (distinct from intonation) is used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Cacua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that no particular intonational pattern is required to exclusively mark interrogative clauses (Paragraph 2). Therefore, intonation alone does not mark polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions that interrogative clauses do not differ from declarative clauses in word order (Paragraph 2). Thus, word order is not used to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit is used to mark polar questions, but it is not restricted to clause-final position (Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3). Therefore, it does not qualify as a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur with predicates, nouns, pronouns, demonstratives, and adjectives, indicating it can appear in various positions within the clause, including medial positions (Paragraph 3). Therefore, it qualifies as a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =nit is not bound to the verb only; it can attach to various parts of speech (Paragraph 3). Thus, it does not qualify as interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- The interrogative clitic =nit is used to mark polar questions and can appear in various positions within the clause, including medial positions.
- There is no evidence of interrogative intonation, word order, clause-initial or clause-final question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone being used to form polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that yes/no questions in Yuracare differ mainly in pitch, with the clause-final stressed syllable getting a higher pitch. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""yokkoshe tiya-m mem=la"" ('Did you really eat it, mother?')

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no evidence or mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone (as opposed to intonation) to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, the following observations can be made regarding the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the order of words in a yes/no question is the same as in a statement and that a question is distinguished from a statement by intonation. This is further supported by Paragraphs 2, 5, 11, 13, and 15, which discuss the intonation patterns for yes/no questions.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Intonation Only** is present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that the word order in a question is the same as in a statement. This indicates that word order does not change to form a polar question.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Word Order** is absent.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-initial Question Particle** is absent.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-final Question Particle** is absent.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Clause-medial Question Particle** is absent.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Verb Morphology** is absent.

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs discuss intonation patterns but do not mention the use of tone (as distinct from intonation) to mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, **Tone** is absent.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Uru,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: Paragraph 1 mentions that word order does not differ significantly between declarative and interrogative clauses, implying that word order is not used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: Paragraph 11 mentions that the form ""kun"" can be interpreted as a second person singular pronoun restricted to interrogative clauses and is placed at the beginning of a phrase. This suggests the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: Paragraph 5 mentions the use of the question bound topic marker ""-xwi"" in yes/no questions. Since ""-xwi"" can appear at the end of the clause, this indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: Paragraph 5 also indicates that the question bound topic marker ""-xwi"" can occur in positions other than the clause-final position. Therefore, it can be considered a clause-medial question particle as well.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of using tone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion

Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** (8.8.2.1 Polar (Yes/No) Questions):
   - Polar questions are marked by rising intonation.
   - Examples provided show that the only difference between declarative and interrogative sentences is the rising intonation.

2. **Paragraph 12** (8.8.2.2 Information Questions):
   - This section discusses information questions (WH questions) and does not provide additional strategies for polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 1** (Footnote):
   - Mentions a morpheme -ta used in the verb base to mark polar questions in the Fortaleza village, which is not present in the Japiim village.

From this information, we can conclude the following:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: The primary strategy for forming polar questions in Apurinã is through rising intonation, as explicitly stated in Paragraph 1.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: In the Fortaleza village, there is a morpheme -ta used in the verb base to mark polar questions, which qualifies as interrogative verb morphology.

No other strategies (interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, tone) are mentioned or implied in the provided paragraphs.
