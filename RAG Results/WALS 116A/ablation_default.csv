Ma'di,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ma'di, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 both mention that yes-no questions can be constructed by adding a final rising tone to a declarative sentence. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used.
   - Example: 
     - (66) ago na ύΐε 'man that witch Q' ('Is that man a witch?')
     - (164) jú mü ra Q 'Are you definitely going?' or 'Will you definitely go?'

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Ma'di changes the word order to form yes-no questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Example: 
     - (66) ago na ύΐε 'man that witch Q' ('Is that man a witch?')

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Ma'di uses a clause-initial question particle to form yes-no questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 mention the use of a high tone at the end of the sentence to indicate a yes-no question. This high tone functions as a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: 
     - (164) jú mü ra Q 'Are you definitely going?' or 'Will you definitely go?'

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Ma'di uses a clause-medial question particle to form yes-no questions.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Ma'di uses specific verb morphology to form yes-no questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 mention the use of a high tone to indicate a yes-no question. This high tone is a tonal change that marks the sentence as a question.
   - Example: 
     - (164) jú mü ra Q 'Are you definitely going?' or 'Will you definitely go?'

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",tone,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Bangime,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bangime, we can analyze the strategies used to form polar questions.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not provide any evidence or mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions. Thus, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions the use of a question particle ""náá"" at the end of the clause in example 194: ""nìì ŋá nìì ŋá à kɔ́mɛ̀ náá ?"". This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence in the text to suggest the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:

Gumuz,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that ""Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question"" (example 7.66). This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 both mention the use of a Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ at the end of the clause (examples 7.67, 7.188, 7.189, 7.190).
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, we code this strategy as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koyra Chiini,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-initial question particle**: The morpheme ""kona"" (with variants ""koni"" and ""kooni"") is mentioned as an apparent clause-initial polar interrogative marker. Although it is rare and possibly a dialectal borrowing, it is still a valid strategy for forming polar questions in Koyra Chiini.

2. **Clause-final question particle**: The conjunction ""wala"" is used at the end of a clause to form polar questions, functioning similarly to the German ""oder?"" ('..., or?').

Other strategies such as interrogative intonation, interrogative word order, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, and tone are not mentioned in the provided paragraph. Therefore, we will code them as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Seme,"### Reasoning:

The provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Seme indicate the presence of a clause-final interrogative particle for forming polar questions. Specifically, paragraph 2.3.4.3.3 mentions the use of the clause-final interrogative particle ""á"" to mark yes-no questions, as illustrated in example 104:

```
À ri le dì á?
3SG FIN food eat.PRFV Q
Did s/he eat?
```

Additionally, it is noted that in negated polar questions, the question particle ""á"" follows the negative particle, as seen in example 105a. This confirms the use of a clause-final question particle as a strategy for forming polar questions in Seme.

No other strategies for forming polar questions, such as interrogative intonation, interrogative word order, clause-initial or clause-medial question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone, are mentioned in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we can conclude that the only strategy explicitly mentioned is the clause-final question particle.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Tima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the formation of polar questions in Tima. The example given in (122a) shows a polar question:

(122a) a-diik-ŋaŋ i-cuuk?
2sg-go-2sg DIR-market
'Are you going to the market?'

From this example, we can observe the following:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The paragraph does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The word order in the question (122a) appears to be the same as in the declarative sentence (2sg-go-2sg DIR-market). There is no indication that the word order changes to form a question.
3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no clause-initial particle in the example provided.
4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The example does not show a clause-final particle either.
5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no clause-medial particle in the example.
6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The verb morphology in the question (122a) does not appear to change specifically for the purpose of forming a question. The verb form 'a-diik-ŋaŋ' is similar to the declarative forms provided in the paradigm.
7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

Given the information provided, it appears that the strategy for forming polar questions in Tima is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, we must code all strategies as 0.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
!Xun (Ekoka),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of !Xun (Ekoka), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The text mentions that ""questions invariably require the use of a question particle (Q), irrespective of whether sentence questions or word questions are involved.""
   - The question particle is placed immediately after the first phrase of the clause, typically after the subject constituent.
   - Examples include:
     - ""wae tsio6 = w06?"" ('Will it rise?')
     - ""sha a 4 rere) re mi iin, ka?"" ('Did you do it? Yes, I did it.')
     - ""W2~sgii gli ge? =a"" ('Is there water?')
     - ""El gle. ka ma tii."" ('Is it heavy?')
   - These examples show that the question particle appears after the first phrase, indicating a clause-medial position.

2. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The text also provides examples where the question particle appears at the end of the clause:
     - ""w0d0? 'Should I go?'""
     - ""ha re ?w- an eris- a jaqm?"" ('Did he kill the emaciated guinea fowl?')
     - ""Peiy- a ti re si de’aa?"" ('Did they steal the heavy axe?')
   - This indicates that the question particle can also appear in the clause-final position.

3. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text.

4. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no indication that !Xun (Ekoka) uses a specific word order to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the text that a question particle appears at the very beginning of the clause.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Katcha,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Ijo (Kolokuma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Kolokuma dialect of Ijo, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - The text mentions that polar questions can be formed by a change of tone pattern, indicated by a question mark. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Example: ""a b6-nimii?"" (is she here?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention of changing the word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Example: ""eri, d6ma tun-a?"" (didn't he sing?)

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - The text explicitly mentions the addition of the interrogative marker ""-ia"" for more emphatic polar questions.
   - Example: ""kjmi, oki-dy-ia?"" (has someone swum?)

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - The interrogative marker ""-ia"" is added to the verb, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""kjmi, oki-dy-ia?"" (has someone swum?)

7. **Tone**: 
   - The text mentions that polar questions can be formed by a change of tone pattern, which is a tonal strategy.
   - Example: ""a b6-nimii?"" (is she here?)

### Conclusion:

Emai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in Emai. 

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that polar interrogatives employ a higher pitch register compared to declaratives, which indicates the use of interrogative intonation. This is evident in example (4) where the sentence structure remains the same as the declarative, but the pitch register is higher.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph mentions that polar interrogatives manifest the same word order as declaratives. Therefore, there is no change in word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a polar question.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph mentions that polar interrogatives employ a higher pitch register, which is a tonal change. However, it does not specify that this is a change in lexical tone, but rather a change in pitch register. Therefore, this does not count as a tonal change in the sense of lexical tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly mentions that polar questions in Ik involve an ""interrogative intonation"" with a low boundary tone. This is a clear indication that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as indicative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text explicitly states that Ik does not use a clause-final question particle like neighboring languages. Instead, the final morpheme in the clause takes a non-final form, which is not the same as a question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar describes that the final morpheme in the clause takes a non-final form in polar questions. This indicates that there is a morphological change in the verb to mark the question, which qualifies as interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: The grammar mentions that the last mora of the question takes a low boundary tone, which is a tonal change specifically for marking polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""","interrogative verb morphology, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing the word order to form polar questions. Thus, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph mentions the question particle ""na"" which can be found clause-initially. Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no explicit mention of a clause-final question particle. Hence, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The question particle ""ti"" generally occupies the second position in a clause, which is a clause-medial position. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology. Thus, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: The question particle ""ti"" can be reduced to a High tone that attaches to the preceding word. This indicates the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 1.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""","clause-initial question particle, second position question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can deduce the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 describes that in interrogative sentences ending in suffixed verbs, a very high pitch occurs on the penultimate vowel segment of the sentence-final word, followed by a fall or remaining high depending on the suffix type. This indicates the use of interrogative intonation to mark questions.
   - Example: (2.61) ""ani ot’-oo-mm-o ?"" ('Did I (M) sleep?')

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples given maintain the same word order as their declarative counterparts.
   - Example: (2.62) ""ise dikko mar-t-ino ?"" ('Did she go to the market?')

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. The verbs in the interrogative sentences do not appear to have additional morphology that marks them as questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - The description of very high pitch on the penultimate vowel segment and its behavior in interrogative sentences suggests the use of tone to mark questions.
   - Example: (2.63) ""ise saale it-t-u ?"" ('Did she eat food?')

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text mentions that ""the raised intonation onto the entire tag clause are main operators which help to achieve the question."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The text states, ""In almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polar questions are exactly the same."" This implies that there is no special word order for forming polar questions, so this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text does not mention a clause-final question particle specifically for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not mention a clause-medial question particle specifically for forming polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The text does not mention any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that ""When an intransitive clause is set to indicate a polar question, it is on the intransitive verb that the high pitch level can be shown."" This indicates that tone is used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Majang,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The grammar explicitly mentions that polar questions in Majang can be marked solely by a rising sentence tone at the end of the question. This is illustrated with examples and pitch drawings (e.g., ""máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?"" and ""nɛ kój cɛ*ːn mɛlɛ cɛːgà kɛɗɔ̀m?"").
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - The grammar states that polar questions do not differ in their order of constituents from their affirmative counterparts.
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is absent.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is absent.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""joː"" is mentioned as a clause-final question marker that stresses the polarity of a question and prevents the use of the interrogative sentence tone.
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is present.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""kíː"" is mentioned as a question marker that can appear near the beginning of a sentence, especially in complex sentences. Since it can appear in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial, it is counted as a clause-medial question particle.
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is present.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   - **Conclusion**: This strategy is absent.

7. **Tone**:
   - The grammar does not mention the use of tone (other than the rising intonation) as a strategy for forming polar questions.

Shatt,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Koromfe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koromfe, we can determine the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that the intonation pattern for questions is not distinct from that of statements, except for the optional high pitch or lengthening of the sentence-final question particle. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone is not a primary strategy. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions that there is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the sentence constituents when forming neutral yes-no questions. This indicates that interrogative word order is not used. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar clearly states that neutral yes-no questions are formed by adding a sentence-final question particle (glossed as QUEST.) to a declarative sentence. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a question. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone as a primary strategy for forming polar questions. The optional high pitch or lengthening of the sentence-final question particle is considered a prosodic feature rather than a tonal change. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Wambaya,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence but are said with a rising, questioning intonation. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.
   - Example: ""Gajbi murnd-u yana manganyma?"" (Can we eat some of this food?)

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Example: ""Yagu ny-a ngayijinya ngangirna?"" (Did you drop your grandmother off?)

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the provided examples or descriptions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-final question particle in the provided examples or descriptions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of an interrogative particle ""gayi"" in some dialects, which appears in the auxiliary or second position in the clause. This particle can be considered clause-medial.
   - Example: ""Duditiarri gayi-ny-u iniyawulu?"" (What, you are spearing them?)

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided examples or descriptions.

Wardaman,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that Gooniyandi does not distinguish declarative from interrogative moods prosodically. Therefore, interrogative intonation is not used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions. The examples provided do not show any reordering of constituents to indicate a question.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology used to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**: The text explicitly states that Gooniyandi does not distinguish declarative from interrogative moods prosodically, which includes tone. Therefore, tone is not used to form polar questions.

The text describes that polar questions in Gooniyandi are expressed by the assertion of a proposition with the intention and expectation that the hearer's agreement or disagreement will be elicited. This is done by marking the information Focus with the enclitic -mi or -ma, which indicates indefiniteness. However, this does not fit into any of the seven predefined strategies for forming polar questions as it is more about the pragmatic use of focus marking rather than a formal grammatical strategy.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",no interrogative-declarative distinction,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph mentions ""an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable (a stressed syllable) of the final word (whether there is the question clitic or not)."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph explicitly states that ""Direct questions or 'yes/no' questions are no different structurally from other types of clauses,"" implying that there is no special word order for forming polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph mentions ""an optional question clitic, -ana, on the final word,"" indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions, apart from the high pitch on the penultimate syllable, which is already accounted for under interrogative intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided text. Thus, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: Paragraph 3 mentions the particle ""6n"" being used at the front of direct polar questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The particle ""6n"" is mentioned as being used at the front of direct polar questions, but there is no indication that it can appear in a medial position. Therefore, we do not have evidence for a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraphs 1 and 2 mention the use of an enclitic copula on the predicate in interrogative clauses. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
English,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of English, we can identify the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions in English.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that declarative questions can be formed with rising intonation: ""Example [i] is what we are calling a declarative question: it has declarative not interrogative syntax, with the question meaning normally signalled by rising intonation or the punctuation.""
   - Paragraph 2 also supports this: ""The echo repeats the stimulus, with rising intonation signalling a request for repetition, or justification.""

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 clearly indicates the use of interrogative word order: ""Polar questions prototypically have the form of a closed interrogative clause, as in Is it breathing? in [4i].""
   - Examples like ""Are you ready?"" and ""Is it ready?"" demonstrate the inversion of the subject and auxiliary verb, which is a hallmark of interrogative word order in English.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Korean,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korean, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Korean.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The second paragraph mentions that when the interrogation is otherwise unmarked in speech, a rising intonation indicates a question. This means that Korean can use interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The second paragraph mentions specific interrogative endings such as ""-(ha)nunya"" and ""-(su)p.nikka"" which are used to mark questions. These are clause-final particles.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-medial question particles in the provided text. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The second paragraph mentions interrogative endings like ""-(ha)nunya"" and ""-(su)p.nikka"". These endings are attached to the verb, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology.
   
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Basque,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Basque, we can identify several strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here's a detailed analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The grammar explicitly states that yes/no questions need not be signaled by any mark other than interrogative intonation (Example 818). This indicates that interrogative intonation is a valid strategy.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a specific interrogative word order being used to form polar questions. The examples provided do not indicate a consistent change in word order to signal a question.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""ba"" is used in some examples (826, 827, 828) and appears at the beginning of the clause. However, it is not clear if it can only appear clause-initially or can also appear in other positions.
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""-a"" is mentioned as occupying the same position as complementizers and is used in examples (820, 823). This suggests it can appear clause-finally.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The particle ""al"" appears in various positions within the clause (819, 821, 822, 824, 825). This indicates that it can be clause-medial.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The grammar does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology being used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The text does not mention any change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**: The text mentions the addition of the interrogative suffix ""-ā"" to transform a sentence into a question. This suffix appears at the end of the sentence, indicating a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The interrogative suffix ""-ā"" is added to the verb to form a question. This indicates the use of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

Iu Mien,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Iu Mien, we can identify the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions in the language. The paragraph mentions two specific strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""fai"" is used at the end of the sentence to indicate a polar question. This is explicitly mentioned in the example (892) where ""fai"" is used with a rising intonation to form a question.
   
2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph also mentions that a falling intonation can indicate a polar question, as seen in the reference to §§3.3.4.3–4 and the example (892).

The paragraph does not mention any other strategies such as interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone. Therefore, we can conclude that these strategies are either not used or not mentioned in the grammar.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Yukaghir (Kolyma),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yukaghir (Kolyma), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that ordinary polar questions are not marked morphologically and that the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a rising intonation contour. This is evident from the examples provided (815a, 815b, 815c, 816a, 816b, 816c), where the questions are formed without any additional morphological markers, relying solely on intonation.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided text. The examples show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions a clause-final particle ""du"" used in alternative questions, but it does not indicate that this particle is used in ordinary polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text explicitly states that ordinary polar questions are not marked morphologically, which means there is no special interrogative verb morphology used.

Georgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Georgian, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that yes-no questions in Georgian are signaled entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation pattern, specifically a rising-falling pitch on the final syllable of the verb. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph mentions that questions of this type involve no movement of words. This implies that there is no special interrogative word order used to form polar questions in Georgian.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the paragraph.

Alutor,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Thai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Thai, we can identify the strategies used to form neutral polar questions in Thai. The paragraph mentions several question particles that are added at the end of the sentence to form questions. Specifically, the particles ""MY,"" ""CHY MY,"" ""REU,"" and ""REU PLOW"" are used to form polar questions.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of interrogative intonation alone to form questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that Thai uses a different word order to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-initial particles being used to form questions.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particles ""MY,"" ""CHY MY,"" ""REU,"" and ""REU PLOW"" are all added at the end of the sentence, indicating the use of clause-final question particles.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-medial particles being used to form questions.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form questions.

Nganasan,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nganasan, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in sentences without a verb, the interrogative mood is indicated by intonation, specifically a rise-fall tone.
   - Paragraph 2 reiterates that verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation, with a high-pitch intonation pattern.

2. **Interrogative word order**: 
   - Both paragraphs indicate that word order does not play a fundamental role in forming polar questions. The word order is usually the same as in declarative sentences, and changing the word order does not change the sentence type.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 1 states that in interrogative sentences containing a verb, the verb must be affixed with a marker for the interrogative mood.
   - Paragraph 2 confirms that if an interrogative sentence contains a verb, it obligatorily takes the interrogative mood marker, which varies with tense.

7. **Tone**: 
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions beyond the intonation patterns already discussed.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Nivkh (South Sakhalin),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Nivkh (South Sakhalin), we can identify the strategy used for forming polar questions. The relevant information is found in the example (74) and the accompanying explanation:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The example (74) shows the use of the particle ""xna-l"" at the end of the clause to form a polar question. This indicates that Nivkh uses a clause-final question particle to mark polar questions.

No other strategies for forming polar questions are mentioned in the paragraph. Specifically:

- There is no mention of **interrogative intonation only**.
- There is no mention of **interrogative word order**.
- There is no mention of a **clause-initial question particle**.

Jarawa (in Andamans),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Jarawa, we can determine the strategy used for forming polar questions in the language. The paragraph explicitly mentions that the interrogative marker ""ka"" is used at the beginning of the sentence to form yes/no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

Here is the breakdown of the strategies:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not mention the use of intonation alone to form yes/no questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form yes/no questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph explicitly states that the interrogative marker ""ka"" is used at the beginning of the sentence. Therefore, we code this as 1.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative marker ""ka"" is specifically mentioned to be at the beginning of the sentence, not in the middle. Therefore, we code this as 0.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a question. Therefore, we code this as 0.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form yes/no questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Nahali,,not mentioned in the grammar,
Kusunda,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kusunda, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions. However, the given text does not provide explicit information about the formation of polar questions. The paragraphs primarily discuss lexical items, pronouns, and interrogative pronouns but do not describe how yes-no questions are formed.

### Reasoning:
1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text does not mention the use of intonation to form polar questions.
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no information provided about changing word order to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The text does not mention any clause-initial particles used for forming polar questions.
4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: There is no mention of clause-final particles for polar questions.
5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not mention any clause-medial particles used for forming polar questions.
6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no information provided about verb morphology changes to form polar questions.
7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

Given the absence of explicit information about polar question formation in the provided text, we must conclude that none of the strategies are mentioned.

### Conclusion:

Udihe,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Udihe, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that yes-no questions in Udihe are differentiated from declarative sentences only by intonational patterns, specifically a higher and more prolonged intonational contour on the last word. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions that yes-no questions are not marked by any changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. Therefore, interrogative word order is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar states that yes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means. Therefore, interrogative verb morphology is not used.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion

Based on the provided information, the strategies for forming polar questions in Udihe are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the Ingush grammar, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The examples provided show the use of the clitic ""=ii"" attached to the verb to form questions. This clitic appears at the end of the clause, indicating that it functions as a clause-final question particle. For instance, ""diesh=ii wa?"" (do you read?) and ""diishâr=ii wa?"" (did you read?).

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation alone to form questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence based on the provided information.

3. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that Ingush uses a specific word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the paragraph to suggest the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The clitic ""=ii"" is attached to the verb, which is typically in the medial position in the examples provided. This suggests that it can function as a clause-medial question particle as well.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The clitic ""=ii"" is attached to the verb, but it is not restricted to the verb alone. Therefore, it does not qualify as interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph mentions the high tone associated with the interrogative clitic ""=ii"", but it does not indicate that tone alone is used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - The grammar mentions that if the interrogative affix is omitted, the interrogative meaning is expressed only by the intonation (rising on the finite verb form). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""Wi dust.uni-z pul 2ga-naV."" ('Your friend has found money?!')

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change for forming polar questions in the provided text. The examples given do not show a distinct interrogative word order different from declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - The particle ""jarab"" is mentioned as a sentence-initial particle used in questions, but it is generally used in questions with the Conditional suffix -t'a and can sometimes be translated by ""I wonder"". It is not explicitly stated as a neutral polar question marker.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used for neutral polar questions.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The interrogative mood affix -ni is used on the finite verb of the sentence to mark polar questions. This affix appears at the end of the verb, which is typically clause-final in Lezgian.
   - Example: ""Betxoven.a-n muzyka wa-z k'an-da-ni?"" ('Do you like Beethoven's music?')

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - The interrogative affix -ni is specifically mentioned to be suffixed to the finite verb, which is typically clause-final. There is no indication that it can appear clause-medially.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The interrogative mood affix -ni is attached to the finite verb, marking it as interrogative verb morphology.
   - Example: ""Wi dust.uni-z pul zga-na-ni?"" ('Did your friend find his money?')

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion:

Galo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that Galo uses a specific word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The text does not mention any clause-initial question particles. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""ree"" is described as a polar interrogative marker that can follow predicative noun phrases or declarative clauses. This indicates that it can appear at the end of a clause. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""ree"" can follow various constituents within the clause, not just at the end. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle (see example 40). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific interrogative word order being used to form polar questions in the provided text. The examples given show that word order can vary depending on the focus of the question, but this does not constitute a distinct strategy of using word order alone to mark questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle |qaa| is described as typically being attached to the sentence-initial word (see examples 33a and 33b). This suggests that |qaa| can function as a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle |qaa| is also shown to occur at the end of the clause (see example 34). This indicates that |qaa| can function as a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle |qaa| can be attached to various constituents within the clause, including medial positions (see example 33). This suggests that |qaa| can function as a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text explicitly states that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb (see ii) Polar questions). Therefore, interrogative verb morphology is not used to form polar questions in Yup'ik.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Mentioned explicitly in the text (example 40).
- **Interrogative word order**: Not mentioned or indicated in the text.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: |qaa| can be attached to the sentence-initial word (examples 33a and 33b).
- **Clause-final question particle**: |qaa| can occur at the end of the clause (example 34).
- **Clause-medial question particle**: |qaa| can be attached to various constituents within the clause (example 33).
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: Explicitly stated as not used for polar questions.
- **Tone**: Not mentioned in the text.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuki,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, the primary strategy for forming polar questions in Yuki is the use of an interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) or its allomorphs, which are attached to the verb. This is explicitly mentioned in the text and illustrated with several examples.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that Yuki uses a specific word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is attached to the verb, which is typically clause-final in the examples provided. However, it is not described as a separate particle but as a suffix. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is a clear example of interrogative verb morphology, as it is attached to the verb to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

Omaha,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Omaha, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here are the key points extracted from the text:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The text explicitly states that a question particle ""a"" is placed after the verb to form a question. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle strategy.

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text mentions that ""we do not raise the pitch of our voice to ask a question in Omaha as we do in English; a question sounds just like a statement."" This explicitly rules out the use of interrogative intonation as a strategy.

3. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing the word order to form questions, so this strategy is not indicated.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a question particle being placed at the beginning of the clause.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""a"" is specifically mentioned to follow the verb, not to be placed in the middle of the clause.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a question.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form questions.

### Conclusion:

Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuchi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle 'le' is described as preferring the second position, which is after the end of the first phrase. This indicates that it can appear in a medial position within the clause. For example, in the sentence ""Yush'igowefa nedzedi'ne le?"" ('Will I see you on Tuesday?'), 'le' appears after the verb phrase.

2. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle 'le' can also appear at the end of a complete phrase, which can be the final position in the clause. For instance, in ""Maxine gowzene seyoki le je"" ('Did you get the quilt from Maxine?'), 'le' appears at the end of the verb phrase.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The particle 'ya' is used in sentence-initial position to form yes/no questions, as seen in examples like ""Ya weyugone?"" ('How about Friday?').

4. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that yes/no questions can also be formed using rising intonation without the particle 'le'. For example, ""Maxine sio'y6thl'i?"" ('Is that Maxine's knife?') uses rising intonation to indicate a question.

The other strategies (Interrogative word order, Interrogative verb morphology, and Tone) are not mentioned in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we will code them as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The paragraph does not mention a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The paragraph does not mention a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph explicitly states that interrogative elements are added to verbs and non-verbal stems. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Arikara,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Arikara, we need to identify the strategies used for forming polar questions. Let's analyze the given text:

#### Paragraph 1:
- The text appears to be a mix of various words and phrases, some of which are not clearly related to the formation of polar questions. However, there is a mention of ""Interrogative for Forms Of Non-Singular Verbs"" and ""change prefix"" which suggests that there might be some morphological changes involved in forming questions.

#### Paragraph 2:
- This paragraph contains various lexical items and glosses. Notably, it includes the term ""yes/no questions"" and mentions ""interrog."" which likely stands for ""interrogative"". However, the specific strategy for forming these questions is not explicitly detailed in the provided text.

Given the information:
- There is a mention of ""change prefix"" in relation to forming questions, which suggests the possibility of interrogative verb morphology.
- The term ""interrog."" is mentioned, but without clear context, it is difficult to determine if it refers to a particle, intonation, or another strategy.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, we can reasonably infer the presence of interrogative verb morphology due to the mention of changing prefixes for forming questions. However, the other strategies are not explicitly mentioned or detailed in the text.

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Takelma,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 describes various pitch inflections in Takelma, including a rising inflection that can give the acoustic effect of a query. However, it does not explicitly state that this intonation alone is used to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot conclusively code this as present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Thus, this strategy is not mentioned.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided text that indicates the use of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the interrogative particle ""di"" added to the end of a statement to form a question (e.g., ""helela’t'tdi""). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that the interrogative enclitic ""di"" usually occupies the second place in the sentence, and less frequently the third place. This suggests that ""di"" can appear in clause-medial positions as well. Therefore, we code this as present.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - While various pitch inflections are described, there is no explicit mention that tone alone is used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Jemez,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Jemez, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The examples provided do not indicate a change in word order for forming polar questions. The structure remains consistent with declarative sentences, with the addition of an interrogative particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The interrogative particle /h&/ is mentioned to follow interrogative words, which typically occur at the beginning of the sentence. However, there is no indication that the particle itself can appear clause-initially without an interrogative word preceding it. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The particle /h&/ is not restricted to the clause-final position. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The particle /h&/ follows interrogative words and can appear in various positions within the clause, depending on the position of the interrogative word. This suggests that it can be clause-medial. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Korafe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Korafe, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - The text mentions that polar questions in Korafe often terminate with a distinct intonation contour. Specifically, the final syllable of the verb in verbal clauses is lengthened and has a unique intonation pattern. This suggests that interrogative intonation is a key strategy.
   - Example 4.1.06: ""Ni geka s-aresa?"" ('Do you want to make a comment?') shows a distinct intonation pattern.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Intonation Only** is present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided text about changing the word order to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Word Order** is not present.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, **Clause-initial Question Particle** is not present.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The text mentions that polar interrogative sentences often terminate with tag words like ""ai?"" ('yes?') or ""ai tefa?"" ('yes or no?'). These are examples of clause-final question particles.
   - Example 4.1.07: ""Ari a=ma eveva=ri, ai?"" ('Are those deeds good, yes?') shows the use of a clause-final question particle.
   - Therefore, **Clause-final Question Particle** is present.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The text does not mention any clause-medial question particles.
   - Therefore, **Clause-medial Question Particle** is not present.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.
   - Therefore, **Interrogative Verb Morphology** is not present.

7. **Tone**:
   - The text does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, **Tone** is not present.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, we can identify the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The text explicitly mentions that neutral yes-no questions in Alamblak are marked by a specific intonation pattern. This pattern involves sustaining a high-level pitch terminated by a down-skip to a low-level pitch. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Alamblak.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form yes-no questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this strategy is used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: The text does not mention the use of any clause-initial particles for forming yes-no questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The text does not mention the use of any clause-final particles for forming yes-no questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The text does not mention the use of any clause-medial particles for forming yes-no questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to indicate yes-no questions in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone (distinct from intonation) to form yes-no questions.

Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Awtuw, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - The grammar explicitly states that yes-no questions are distinguished from declarative clauses by a change in intonation contour. Specifically, the last word stress in the clause is appreciably higher in pitch, and the pitch of any syllables following that stressed syllable falls markedly. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form yes-no questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**: 
   - The grammar mentions that constituents in a yes-no question have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence. This implies that there is no special interrogative word order for forming yes-no questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: 
   - The particle ""yokri"" is mentioned as a possible element in yes-no questions, but it is explicitly stated that it may not occur clause-initially. Therefore, this strategy is not used.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**: 
   - The particle ""yokri"" is most commonly found in clause-final position in yes-no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle strategy.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: 
   - The particle ""yokri"" can also occur clause-medially, where it has the effect of focusing the constituent it follows. This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle strategy.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: 
   - There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. The verb forms in the examples do not show any special interrogative morphology.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**: 
   - The grammar does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming yes-no questions. The change in intonation contour described pertains to pitch rather than tone.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mian,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text mentions that polar questions in Mian are characterized by a specific intonational contour, with a short intonational peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used as a strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text explicitly states that constituent order does not change in questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Mian.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative illocutionary clitic =a is used at the end of the sentence to form polar questions. Additionally, the word ""bleka"" (meaning 'or') can also appear at the end of the sentence to form polar questions. Thus, this strategy is used.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not mention any clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =a attaches to the verb in verbal predicates, but it is not exclusively bound to the verb and can attach to other constituents. Therefore, this does not count as interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Mian are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chácobo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that ""Interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation to my knowledge."" Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided do not show any reordering of constituents to indicate a question. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text does not mention a clause-final question particle. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The morpheme ""ní"" is used in non-verbal predicate constructions and occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject. This suggests it is a clause-medial question particle. Additionally, the morphemes =ʔiní, =ʔá, =ʔaí, and =ní are used in verbal predicate constructions and appear to be clitics that can be bound to the verb, indicating they are not clause-medial particles. Therefore, this strategy is present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The morphemes =ʔiní, =ʔá, =ʔaí, and =ní are used to mark interrogativity in verbal predicate constructions. These morphemes are bound to the verb, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, this strategy is present.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph mentions that when person and interrogative mood inflexion of a question are omitted, there is a notable rise of intonation on the last syllable of the interrogative verb (example 1336). This indicates that interrogative intonation is used as a strategy for forming polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraph. Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph clearly states that the interrogative mood marker ""-re"" (or its variant) is attached to the verb to form questions (examples 1330, 1331, 1332, 1333, 1334, 1335). This indicates the use of interrogative verb morphology as a strategy for forming polar questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraph.

Based on this analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Kwaza are:

- Interrogative intonation only: 1

Cocama,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly mentions that polar questions can be indicated solely by prosody, with a specific intonation contour described as ""slowly ascendant pitch plus abrupt rising at the end"" (see paragraph 9.4.1.2). Therefore, this strategy is present.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar describes a strategy involving subject-verb inversion to form polar questions (see paragraph 9.4.1.3). This indicates that interrogative word order is used in Cocama.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The morpheme =tipa is used as an interrogative marker and can be attached to the end of the questioned element, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the clause-final position (see paragraph 9.4.1.1). Therefore, this strategy is present.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Since =tipa can follow any constituent, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the clause-medial position, this strategy is also present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text.

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - The paragraphs explicitly state that polar questions in Murui are formed using a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate. This is a clear indication that interrogative intonation is used.
   - Example: ""uzu-maS jo-fo-moLOC ↗↗jaai-↘d-e?"" (Did the grandfather go home?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The morphology and syntax of polar interrogatives are identical to those of a declarative clause.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - The text does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology. The optional omission of the verb inflection for the 3rd person is noted, but this does not constitute a distinct interrogative verb morphology.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

7. **Tone**: 
   - The text does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Iquito as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that yes-no questions in Iquito are structurally the same as declarative sentences, with the only difference being the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, which displays a rising pattern. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph does not mention any changes in word order for forming yes-no questions. It explicitly states that yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the paragraph.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the paragraph.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the paragraph.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific interrogative verb morphology in the paragraph.

7. **Tone**: The paragraph does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Movima,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Movima, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Let's analyze the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 (2.8.5. Intonation) clearly states that interrogative utterances in Movima are marked by a specific intonation pattern. The basic stress and intonation rule for a yes/no question involves stress and high tone on the antepenultimate syllable of the entire utterance.
   - Paragraph 3 (7.14. Questions and answers) reiterates that a yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 (2.8.4. Tone) mentions that there is no lexical tone in Movima, but intonation plays an important role at the utterance level to mark interrogative sentences. This is further detailed in 2.8.5, where the specific intonation pattern for yes/no questions is described.

Given the information, the only strategy explicitly mentioned for forming polar questions in Movima is the use of interrogative intonation.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Bora,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text states that questions are spoken with the same intonation as declaratives, but there may be tone changes. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone is not a primary strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form yes-no questions. The examples provided (921 and 922) do not indicate a reordering of words compared to declarative sentences. Thus, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The text mentions that yes-no questions are formed by starting them with a ‘yes/no’ particle. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that there may be tone changes in questions, but it does not specify that tone alone is used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",clause-initial question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that interrogative intonation distinguishes yes-no interrogatives from declarative sentences. This is evident from the statement: ""Interrogative intonation, however, distinguishes yes-no interrogatives from declarative sentences.""

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The sentence-final particle ""quem"" is frequently used in yes-no questions, as indicated by the example: ""Pa' ma hwam ma' quem?"" ('Did you kill fish?'). This confirms the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aymara (Central),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Central Aymara, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions.

**Paragraph 1:**
- The suffix ""-ti"" is mentioned as an interrogative marker that can be attached to the predicate. This indicates the use of interrogative verb morphology.
- There is no mention of changes in word order, specific particles, or intonation patterns for forming questions.

**Paragraph 2:**
- The suffix ""-ti"" is again mentioned as an interrogative marker used in positive interrogative sentences. This reinforces the use of interrogative verb morphology.
- There is no mention of other strategies such as clause-initial, clause-final, or clause-medial particles, nor is there any mention of tone or intonation changes.

Given the information, the only strategy explicitly mentioned is the use of interrogative verb morphology.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Clause-medial question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" is used after the constituent under interrogation. This indicates that the particle can appear in various positions within the clause, depending on which element is being questioned. For example:
   - (1) [hi fa-tke]-a hai-tl? ('Do you want to kill me?')
   - (2) [hiwan xot’ken]-a? ('Are you (PL) digging?')
   - (3) [ni] a de hi chi? ('Are you already here?')
   - (4) [wanyi sone-n]-a? ('Are they drinking?')

   Since the particle ""a"" can follow different constituents within the clause, it qualifies as a clause-medial question particle. Additionally, it can appear in the clause-final position as seen in examples (2) and (4), so it also qualifies as a clause-final question particle.

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph mentions that it is also possible to express interrogation without the use of the enclitic ""a"" by changing the intonational contour of the clause. This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions.

3. **Other strategies**: There is no mention of interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone as strategies for forming polar questions in the provided paragraph. Therefore, these strategies are not applicable based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions in Apinayé:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text states that polarity questions may be expressed with the same structure as declarative clauses but with a distinct intonation pattern. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Apinayé.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The paragraph mentions the use of the positional clitic ""cõ"" (or its alternative form ""cõo"") at the absolute clause-initial position to form polar questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The clitic ""cõ"" is specifically mentioned to occur at the clause-initial position, not clause-medial. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yagua, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that no special intonation occurs when forming a question (Paragraph 2.8.1, sentence 4). Therefore, this strategy is not used in Yagua.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Yagua.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Yagua.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""-viy"" is used as a question marker and can appear at the end of the clause (Examples 159, 160, 161). Therefore, this strategy is used in Yagua.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""-viy"" is described as being cliticized to the verb, which suggests it is not a free particle that can appear in various positions within the clause. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Yagua.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The particle ""-viy"" is cliticized to the verb (Examples 159, 160, 161), which indicates that it is a form of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, this strategy is used in Yagua.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, this strategy is not used in Yagua.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Cacua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not indicate any changes in word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the text of a clause-initial question particle being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur at the end of the clause, as seen in examples (55), (58), (59), (60), (61), and (62). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur with various constituents within the clause, including predicates, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, as described in the text. This suggests that it can be clause-medial as well. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuracare,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Yuracare, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. The key information is found in the following excerpt:

> ""Yes/no questions are structurally not very deviant from declarative sentences, they differ mainly in pitch: ... Yes/no questions are only marked by the fact that the clause final stressed syllable gets a higher pitch, indicated in (41) by means of italics.""

From this, we can infer the following:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that yes/no questions differ mainly in pitch, specifically that the clause-final stressed syllable gets a higher pitch. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text mentions that yes/no questions are structurally not very deviant from declarative sentences. This suggests that there is no special word order for forming polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided text.
7. **Tone**: The text mentions a change in pitch, specifically a higher pitch on the clause-final stressed syllable. This can be interpreted as a tonal change used to indicate a question.

Given this information, we can conclude the following:

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Kuna,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that questions in Kuna have a different intonation pattern from statements. Specifically, the pitch of a question is higher than that of a statement, with the last word of the question being even higher in pitch before falling off quickly. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a key strategy for forming polar questions in Kuna.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text mentions that the word order in a yes/no question is the same as in a statement. This means that Kuna does not use a different word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided text.

7. **Tone**: The text does not mention the use of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the descriptive grammar, the strategies for forming polar questions in Kuna are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Uru,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is a mention of a tendency towards OSV word order in yes/no questions without the question bound topic marker -xwi (example 50 and 54). This suggests that word order can be used to indicate a question. Therefore, we code this as 1.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text mentions the use of the question bound topic marker -xwi, which appears to be a clause-final particle (example 49). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:

Camsá,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The grammar states that yes/no questions can have any word order. This implies that there is no specific interrogative word order used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The grammar mentions that yes/no questions often end with the tag ""aiñe o ndoñ"" (yes or no?) and also with the particle ""ka"". This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The grammar mentions that the verb ""jan"" (go) shows different morphology in questions compared to the usual affirmative form. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - The grammar explicitly states that Warao uses the verbal interrogative marker **-ra** as a suffix to form yes-no questions. This marker is attached to the main verb or an auxiliary verb in the sentence.
   - Example (40): ""noboto yahinoto —ya tobe yawar —a —e —ra"" ('Did the jaguar pull the child to its burrow?')
   - Example (41): ""waba -komoni t —a —e —ra"" ('Couldn’t they die on that side of the river?')

2. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - The text mentions that rising intonation is associated with questioning, but it also states that this matter has not been sufficiently explored by the author. Therefore, while intonation might play a role, it is not confirmed as the sole strategy for forming polar questions.

3. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - The interrogative marker **-ra** is described as a suffix that appears at the end of the verb, which is typically clause-final in Warao sentences. However, since it is a suffix and not a separate particle, it does not qualify as a clause-final question particle.

4. **Interrogative word order**:
   - The grammar explicitly states that yes-no questions in Warao do not involve a change in constituent order from declarative sentences. Therefore, interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Warao.

5. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text.

6. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided text.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Cuiba,"Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Cuiba, it is challenging to extract explicit information about the strategies used to form polar questions. The paragraph primarily discusses the distribution and examples of goal clitics and adjectives, without directly addressing the formation of polar questions.

However, let's analyze the given information to see if any clues can be inferred:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation patterns in the provided text, so we cannot confirm this strategy.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not provide any information about changes in word order for forming questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no explicit mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no explicit mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no explicit mention of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text does not discuss any verb morphology related to forming questions.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form questions.

Given the lack of explicit information about the formation of polar questions in the provided paragraph, we must code all strategies as 0.

### Reasoning:
- The paragraph does not provide any direct information about the strategies used to form polar questions in Cuiba.
- Without explicit mention or examples of how polar questions are formed, we cannot infer the presence of any specific strategy.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraph explicitly states that polar questions in Apurinã are marked prosodically by rising intonation. This is the primary method for distinguishing interrogative clauses from their declarative counterparts. Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of any change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of any clause-initial question particle used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of any clause-final question particle used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of any clause-medial question particle used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraph mentions that in the speech variety of the Fortaleza village, there is a morpheme ""-ta"" used in the verb base to mark polar questions. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology in at least one speech variety of Apurinã. Therefore, this strategy is present.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. The rising intonation mentioned is a prosodic feature, not a tonal one. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraph, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in Kadiwéu. The paragraph primarily discusses wh-questions and their syntactic behavior, including movement and constraints. However, it explicitly mentions the difficulty in eliciting simple yes-no questions, stating that attempts to elicit such questions resulted in responses framed as wh-questions instead.

Given this information, we can infer the following:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraph does not provide any evidence or mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

Since the grammar explicitly states that attempts to elicit yes-no questions resulted in wh-questions, it suggests that the language may not have a straightforward mechanism for forming polar questions, or at least it is not documented in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Karajá, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using only interrogative intonation to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not mention any specific word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative morpheme ""ado)èbo"" (♀) or ""ao)èbo"" (♂) is described as a second-position clitic, which means it does not necessarily appear at the end of the clause. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative morpheme ""ado)èbo"" (♀) or ""ao)èbo"" (♂) is described as a second-position clitic, which means it can appear in a medial position within the clause. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
