1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no indication that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 17 mentions clause-initial particles like ""tähä"" and ""tä"" used to form yes/no questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Multiple paragraphs (e.g., Paragraphs 3, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21) mention the use of clause-final particles such as ""la,"" ""bi,"" and ""mä"" to form yes/no questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

   - Paragraph 9 also supports this by stating that it is possible to add a final rising tone to a declarative sentence to turn it into a yes-no question.
   - Paragraph 11 mentions that subordinate yes-no questions can be coded just by rising intonation.
   - Paragraph 15 reiterates the use of a high tone on yes-no questions for emphasis.
   - Conclusion: **1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions.
   - Conclusion: **0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle.

Gumuz,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gumuz, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that ""Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally indicates a Yes/No question."" This suggests that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 1.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that ""The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic.""
   - Paragraph 3 provides examples where the Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ is added to the end of the clause.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 3 indicates that the Yes/No question marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ is added to the end of the clause, but it does not specify that this marker is bound to the verb only.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, code this strategy as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Koyra Chiini,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Koyra Chiini, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 5 mentions that KCh has no reliable polar interrogative morpheme and that the usual simple polar question has the form of an assertion, usually with rising terminal intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 5 mentions that some younger speakers use clause-initial ""eska"" (from French ""est-ce que"") and a morpheme ""kona"" (variants ""koni"", ""kooni"") as clause-initial polar interrogative markers. Although ""kona"" is rare, its presence indicates that clause-initial question particles are used.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 3 states that clause-final polar interrogative ""ba"" is a characteristic feature of DjCh (Djenne Chiini). Since the task is to determine features for Koyra Chiini (KCh), and no clause-final particle is mentioned for KCh, we cannot confirm this strategy for KCh.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

Sidaama,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 5 explicitly mentions that Sidaama uses intonation for questions without any suffix, as in examples (ib) and (iib). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a change in word order being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 5 mentions a question suffix -ni, but it is stated that the consultant finds this form ungrammatical and does not use it. Therefore, we code this as 0.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 5 mentions a question suffix -ni, but it is stated that the consultant finds this form ungrammatical and does not use it. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 9 discusses the use of very high pitch in interrogative sentences, which is higher than in their declarative counterparts. This indicates that tone is used to mark polar questions.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Mursi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can identify the strategies used to form polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar questions, a constituent with a raised intonation is expected to take the focus position. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 5 also supports this by stating that a polar question can be formed by raising the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at the end of a clause.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that the syntactic order of constituents in declarative sentences and polar questions are exactly the same. This implies that there is no change in word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that a polar question can be formed by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement. This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar questions involving an intransitive clause, it is on the intransitive verb that the high pitch level can be shown. This suggests that tone is used to form polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Mursi are as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0
- **Tone**: 1

### Final Output:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that polar questions in Majang can be marked by a rising sentence tone at the end of the question. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 14 further supports this by describing a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause as the only difference between questions and their affirmative counterparts.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that a change in word order alone marks polar questions in Majang. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Majang uses a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 mentions the use of a special question particle ""kíː"" in polar questions, and Paragraph 4 describes the question marker ""joː"" that appears at the end of a question. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Paragraph 5 also supports this by mentioning that the question marker ""joː"" is used particularly when the question is a complex sentence and marks the question as such near the beginning of the sentence but can appear clause-finally.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that the question marker ""joː"" can be used near the beginning of the sentence, indicating it can appear clause-medially. Since it can also appear clause-finally, we code 1 for both ""Clause-medial question particle"" and ""Clause-final question particle"".

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Majang uses interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 describe the use of a specific interrogative sentence tone for forming polar questions. This indicates that tone is used as a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions the question ""Does he smoke? aya taba?"" without any additional particles or changes in word order, suggesting that intonation might play a role. However, there is no explicit mention that intonation alone can form a polar question.
   - Conclusion: Not enough evidence to confirm this strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: No evidence to support this strategy.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: No evidence to support this strategy.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 provides the example ""Does he smoke? aya taba?"" and ""He does not smoke ayasha."" The structure suggests that ""aya"" might be a question particle, but its position is not explicitly stated as clause-final.
   - Conclusion: Not enough evidence to confirm this strategy.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions interpolated particles like ""ngi"" and ""mve"" that can appear in the middle of the clause, but it does not explicitly state their use in forming polar questions.
   - Conclusion: Not enough evidence to confirm this strategy.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: No evidence to support this strategy.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 6 discusses the importance of tone in Birri, but it does not explicitly state that tone alone can form polar questions.
   - Conclusion: Not enough evidence to confirm this strategy.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the presence of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in Birri. Therefore, all strategies are coded as 0.

   - Paragraph 23 confirms that the intonation of yes-no questions is identical to that of statements, with the exception that the sentence-final question particle can optionally have a high pitch and is often lengthened. This implies that intonation alone is not sufficient to mark a question.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 9 states that there is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the sentence constituents for neutral yes-no questions.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 9 both mention that neutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentence-final question particle to a declarative sentence.
   - **Conclusion**: 1

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of any interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0

7. **Tone**:

Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that ""the same forms that are used in making statements are also used in asking questions."" This implies that there is no distinct morphological or syntactic marker for questions, suggesting that interrogative intonation might be used to distinguish questions from statements.
   - Paragraph 2 supports this by stating that ""requests of confirmation or disconfirmation (polar yes/no questions) are expressed by the assertion of a proposition,"" which again implies that intonation could be a key factor.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any change in word order to form polar questions. The statements suggest that the same forms are used for both statements and questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions the enclitic ""-mi - -ma"" which is frequently found in requests of confirmation (i.e., 'yes' or 'no'). This suggests that a clause-final question particle might be used.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The enclitic ""-mi - -ma"" is mentioned as being added to the word on which information focus falls. This could be clause-medial depending on the position of the focused word.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from statements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the strategies for forming polar questions in Gooniyandi are as follows:

Tiwi,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tiwi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that direct questions or 'yes/no' questions are structurally similar to other types of clauses, except for an optional question clitic, -ana, on the final word, and an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the final word. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Paragraph 1 also supports this by mentioning the use of an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the final word, whether the question clitic is present or not.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that the grammatical relationship of arguments is not determined by word order in the clause in TT (Traditional Tiwi) and the order is relatively free. This suggests that interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Tiwi.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions an optional question clitic, -ana, on the final word of the clause. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

   - Paragraph 4 mentions an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the final word, which is related to intonation rather than tone. Therefore, tone as a strategy is not explicitly mentioned.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Tiwi are as follows:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 0
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 0
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 0
- **Tone**: 0

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The presence of an extra high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the final word indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
- **Interrogative word order**: The free word order in Tiwi suggests that word order is not used to form polar questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of such a particle.
- **Clause-final question particle**: The optional question clitic -ana on the final word indicates the use of a clause-final question particle.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of such a particle.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology for questions.
- **Tone**: The high pitch mentioned is related to intonation, not tone.

   - Paragraph 10 states, ""Yes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative intonation,"" providing a clear indication that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Interrogative intonation only.""

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 10 also mentions, ""There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in particular verb fronting,"" indicating that a change in word order (verb fronting) can mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Interrogative word order.""

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle specifically used for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Clause-initial question particle.""

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions, ""Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions, such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle (3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers (3.5.7.3).""
   - The particle -a is described as occupying the same position as complementizers, which can be clause-final.
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Clause-final question particle.""

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions the particle ""al"" which can appear in the middle of the clause: ""The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the interrogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a.""
   - Therefore, code 1 for ""Clause-medial question particle.""

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of interrogative verb morphology specifically used for forming polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Interrogative verb morphology.""

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to mark polar questions.
   - Therefore, code 0 for ""Tone.""

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can extract the following relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 22**: This paragraph mentions that interrogative sentences in Malayalam are formed by the addition of the interrogative suffix ""-o"" or ""-aa"". This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
   
2. **Paragraph 37**: This paragraph reiterates that a sentence is transformed into a question by the addition of an interrogative suffix.

Given this information, we can determine the strategies used in Malayalam for forming polar questions:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of this strategy in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code it as 0.
- **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code it as 0.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, we code it as 0.
- **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code it as 0.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, we code it as 0.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraphs explicitly mention the use of an interrogative suffix ""-o"" or ""-aa"" to form questions, which is bound to the verb. Therefore, we code it as 1.
- **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions. Therefore, we code it as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

     IRR=want NOW
     ‘Would (you) want to, or not?’
     ```

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 7 mentions that when ""ma="" is procliticised to the verb, it forms an interrogative.
   - Example:
     ```
     (94) brapa? tan Ian ma=brus?
     how.many instance want IRR=scrub.cloth
     ‘How many times do (I) need to scrub (it)?’

Udihe,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information about the strategies for forming polar questions in Udihe:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that yes-no questions in Udihe are not marked by any additional morphological means or changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. They are differentiated only by intonational patterns, specifically a higher and more prolonged intonational contour on the last word. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Paragraph 7 supports this by mentioning that in yes-no questions, intonation rises considerably on the last word of the sentence.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 3 clearly states that yes-no questions are not marked by changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence. This means that interrogative word order is not used to form polar questions in Udihe.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only:**
   - Paragraph 27 mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle, which indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""Tekit-úq? # Nuk’aq?"" (Has Nuk’aq arrived?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that changing word order alone can form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 18 explicitly states that a sentence-initial qaa (as *TDDXLWD-lar-tuci ma-a-ni?) is unacceptable, indicating that clause-initial question particles are not used.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 18 describe the use of the particle |qaa| as a polar question marker that is typically attached to the first word of the clause but not necessarily at the end. However, it is not explicitly stated that it can only appear clause-finally.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 18 describe the particle |qaa| as typically attached to the first word of the clause, indicating it can appear clause-medially.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology:**
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 14 mention that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb, indicating that interrogative verb morphology is not used for polar questions.

7. **Tone:**
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone (distinct from intonation) is used to mark polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Yup'ik (Norton Sound) are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Yuchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used in Yuchi for forming polar questions. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that yes/no questions can be formed with rising intonation alone, without the particle ""ye"". This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - Example: ""Maxine 'le sio'y6thl'i?"" vs. ""Maxine sio-'y6thl'i?"" (with just rising intonation).

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing word order to form polar questions. The examples and descriptions focus on particles and intonation rather than word order changes.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 mentions the particle ""ya"" used in yes/no questions, which is placed at the beginning of the sentence. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.
   - Example: ""Henry 'ya."" (It's Henry, I expect).

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and several other paragraphs (e.g., Paragraph 10) describe the particle ""le"" which can appear at the end of a complete phrase, including the verb phrase, indicating it can function as a clause-final question particle.
   - Example: ""Maxine 'le sio'y6thl'i?"" (Is that Maxine's knife?).

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 7 describe the particle ""le"" as preferring the second position in the clause, which can be after the first phrase or within the clause. This indicates it can function as a clause-medial question particle.
   - Example: ""Nek'ala le h6k'6?"" (Isn't he working?).

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology (e.g., suffixes or infixes on the verb) that marks a clause as a polar question. The focus is on particles and intonation.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone (distinct from intonation) being used to mark polar questions. The descriptions focus on intonation and particles.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, there is no explicit mention of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions.

Arikara,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Arikara:

1. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph mentions that it is a simple matter to change statements into questions that can be answered with ""yes"" or ""no"". This suggests that there is a straightforward method for forming polar questions, but it does not specify the exact strategy used.

2. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph provides specific examples of how statements are transformed into questions. It mentions that the word part ""ka"" is added to form questions. For example, ""saNIsini’"" (he is singing) becomes ""ka saNIsini’?"" (is he singing?). This indicates the use of a clause-initial question particle.

3. **Paragraph 27**: This paragraph discusses the interrogative forms of non-singular verbs and mentions that the indicative prefix is changed to an interrogative prefix ""ka"". This further supports the use of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Paragraph 38**: This paragraph reiterates that the indicative prefix is dropped and replaced with ""ka"" to form questions. This confirms the use of a clause-initial question particle.

From these paragraphs, we can conclude that Arikara uses a clause-initial question particle ""ka"" to form polar questions. There is no mention of other strategies such as interrogative intonation, word order changes, clause-final or clause-medial particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Takelma, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 14 mentions the use of a raised pitch for questions, similar to the intonation pattern in English questions like ""Did he go?"" This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of changing word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 mentions the interrogative enclitic ""di"" used in questions. However, it is not specified that this particle appears at the beginning of the clause.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 6 indicate the use of the interrogative particle ""di"" at the end of the clause, as in ""giniga’t‘tdi pi"" (Did you go somewhere?).
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 suggests that the particle ""di"" can appear after the first word of the sentence, indicating it can be clause-medial.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that the particle ""di"" is pronounced with a pitch lower than the normal level, but this does not indicate that tone alone is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Toqabaqita,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Toqabaqita, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of declarative sentences, with the only difference being in the intonation. Declarative sentences have a falling intonation, while polar interrogatives have a rising intonation towards the end.
   - Example: 
     - Declarative: ""Qe qako naqa."" (It [food] is cooked/done now.)
     - Interrogative: ""Qe qako naqa?"" (Is it cooked/done now?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Toqabaqita uses a different word order to form polar questions. The structure remains the same as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Toqabaqita uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Toqabaqita uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:

   - The provided paragraphs do not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Toqabaqita are as follows:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Aghu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Aghu, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 10 mentions that although Aghu has grammaticalized ways of marking a question, intonation is one of the ways to mark questions. However, there is no explicit confirmation that intonation alone can mark polar questions. Thus, we cannot definitively code this as 1.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about changing word order to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 13 provide examples where the question particle ""=ka"" or ""xajo"" appears at the end of the clause, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle. Thus, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 14 show that verbs can combine with the polar question particles ""=ka"" or ""a xajo"". However, these particles are not bound to the verb only; they can follow other constituents. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: 
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs about tone marking polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Makasae,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Makasae, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Makasae can be marked solely by a rising-falling intonation contour. This is evident from the example provided: ""Ei so’ot=ini uerileuk?"" which translates to ""Do you want to have (your) bottom drilled?"" The pitch contour shows a distinctive rise and fall, marking it as a question without any additional morphological markers.
   - Therefore, this strategy is present.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of changing the word order to form polar questions. The examples given maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not present.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence from the provided paragraphs that Makasae uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not present.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 10 mention the use of the clitic =ua and =uai as question markers that are cliticized to the right end of the question. Examples include: ""Ei hana’e Iliomar isi-la’a=ee ei Makalero lolo=ua?"" and ""… ei to-so’ot=uai na’an?"" which translate to ""When you were in Iliomar, did you speak Makalero?"" and ""… do you want to (do it) or not?"" respectively.
   - Therefore, this strategy is present.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not present.

Motuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Motuna, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed with the intonation of a polar question. Paragraph 4 further describes the intonation pattern for polar interrogative sentences, indicating that the final stressed mora has a rising pitch followed by a sharp falling contour. This confirms the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 2 mentions that question words are pronounced with a high pitch, but this pertains to content questions (wh-questions) rather than polar questions. Paragraph 4 describes the intonation pattern for polar questions but does not indicate that tone alone (as opposed to intonation) is used to mark polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Confirmed by Paragraphs 1 and 4, which describe the use of intonation to form polar questions.
- **Interrogative word order**: Not mentioned.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: Not mentioned.
- **Clause-final question particle**: Not mentioned.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: Not mentioned.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: Not mentioned.
- **Tone**: The high pitch on question words pertains to content questions, not polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Kwomtari,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kwomtari, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Kwomtari are formed with ""pe"" and are indistinguishable from statements like ""possibly..."". It is suggested that intonation might distinguish them from statements, but this is not confirmed. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that interrogative intonation alone is used.
   - Paragraph 2 reiterates that polar questions formed by the possibility particle ""pe"" are indistinguishable from statements and suggests that an intonation contour might distinguish them, but this is not confirmed.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any change in word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 both indicate that the particle ""pe"" follows each constituent the speaker focuses on with their question. This suggests that ""pe"" can occur in clause-medial positions.
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that ""pe"" is used in polar questions and follows each questioned constituent, reinforcing the clause-medial position.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to form polar questions.

   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that word order changes to form polar questions. Therefore, we assume this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

While question sentences, regardless of their construction, are usually accompanied by rising intonation, this intonation can also function as a question marker in itself when added to an otherwise indicative sentence, in which case the result is a polar question.""
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Example: ""wa foj?"" (How are you?) and ""wa hamam?"" (Have you eaten?)

2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Sentani.

Arapesh (Abu),"Based on the provided paragraphs, the strategies for forming polar questions in Arapesh (Abu) can be determined as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 26 mention that polar questions can be formed by changing the intonation of a statement. Specifically, an abrupt rising intonation at the end of the sentence indicates a question.

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**: Paragraph 5 mentions the use of ""_ba uwa'_"" (‘or not’) at the end of an indicative sentence to form a polar question. This particle can be contracted to ""_ba_"" and is accompanied by a sentence-final rising intonation.

3. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraph 5 provides an example where the verb morphology changes to indicate a question. The example shows a verb with the suffix ""-hi'i"" in a question form.

The other strategies are not mentioned or indicated in the provided paragraphs.

**Reasoning**:
- **Interrogative Intonation Only**: Paragraphs 5 and 26 explicitly describe the use of rising intonation to form questions.
- **Clause-final Question Particle**: Paragraph 5 describes the use of ""_ba uwa'_"" or its contracted form ""_ba_"" at the end of a sentence to form a question.
- **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraph 5 shows an example of a verb with a specific suffix used in a question.

   - Paragraph 4 also discusses the intonation contours of polar questions, indicating that intonation plays a significant role in forming these questions.
   - Paragraph 12 further supports the use of intonation by describing the frequency and amplitude contours associated with polar questions.
   - Paragraph 16 mentions that polar questions have a higher frequency range and terminate at a higher pitch than declarative sentences, reinforcing the role of intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs about changing word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of tag words like ""ai?"" or ""ai tefa?"" at the end of polar questions, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Paragraph 4 provides examples of sentences ending with ""ai?"" or ""ai tefa?"" to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 10 also includes examples of polar questions ending with ""ai?"" or ""ai tefa?"".

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-medial question particle being used to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 5 discusses the use of the speech-act value marker {-i} on the final verb in polar questions, indicating that verb morphology is used to mark polar questions.
   - Paragraph 6 further supports this by showing examples where the speech-act value marker {-i} is used to indicate polar questions.
   - Paragraph 23 also mentions the use of speech-act value markers like {-i} in forming questions.

Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Alamblak:

1. **Paragraph 5**: States that all Yes/No interrogative clauses are syntactically unmarked for the interrogative feature. This suggests that there is no specific syntactic structure (like word order change or particles) marking polar questions.
   
2. **Paragraph 6**: Mentions that yes-no questions tend to have the same intonation as non-final clause terminals, which is usually a rising intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 12**: Confirms that yes/no interrogative clauses are morpho-syntactically indistinguishable from independent declarative clauses, reinforcing the idea that there are no specific morphological or syntactic markers for polar questions.

Given this information, we can conclude the following:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: The presence of rising intonation for yes-no questions indicates that this strategy is used.
- **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
- **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific verb morphology marking polar questions.
- **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 6 provides an example with ""amo"" (who) in the preverbal focus position, but this is related to content questions. There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle for polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 20 mentions clause-final particles but does not specify their use for forming polar questions. The examples provided are related to other functions such as negation and dubitative markers.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 6 provides an example of an interrogative clause with ""amo b-ei?"" (who QSG-do), where ""b-ei"" seems to be an interrogative verb form. However, this example is related to content questions rather than polar questions. There is no explicit mention of interrogative verb morphology for polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 17 discusses the use of tone in I'saka, but it does not mention the use of tone specifically for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of any of the 7 strategies for forming polar questions in I'saka. Therefore, we code all strategies as 0.

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Urim,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Urim, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that juxtaposed, non-serialized clauses are distinguished from verb serialization constructions by intonation. This suggests that intonation plays a role in distinguishing different types of clauses, including questions. However, there is no explicit mention that intonation alone can form polar questions.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 5 states that Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language and that the position of the subject is very fixed. This suggests that word order is not used to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that the negator ""kalpis"" can be used to answer yes/no questions and at the end of the clause to strengthen the negation. However, this does not indicate the presence of a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 7 mentions the use of ""aki"" in questions to give alternatives, often occurring in the final position. This suggests that ""aki"" can function as a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

Awtuw,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 7 states that yes-no questions in Awtuw are distinguished from declarative clauses by a change in intonation contour. This indicates that intonation alone can mark a polar question.
   - Example (1) in Paragraph 7 shows that the same word order is used in both declarative and interrogative sentences, with the difference being the intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - Paragraph 7 explicitly mentions that constituents in a yes-no question have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence. This suggests that word order does not change to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in any of the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 7 mentions that the particle ""yokri"" (perhaps) frequently occurs clause-finally in yes-no questions. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - Example (7) in Paragraph 7 shows ""yokri"" in a clause-final position, marking a yes-no question.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 7 also notes that ""yokri"" can occur clause-medially, focusing the constituent it follows. This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

Mian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only:**
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that polar questions in Mian are characterized by a short intonational peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance. This suggests that intonation plays a role in marking polar questions.
   - However, the presence of the interrogative clitic =a or the word ""bleka"" 'or' is also necessary, indicating that intonation alone is not sufficient.
   - **Code: 0** (Intonation alone is not sufficient for marking polar questions).

2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be is simply replaced by =a, and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour.
   - **Code: 0** (Word order does not change to form polar questions).

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle:**
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0** (No clause-initial question particle is mentioned).

4. **Clause-final Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 mention the use of the interrogative clitic =a, which encliticizes to the immediately preceding word and forms a single prosodic word with it. This clitic appears at the end of the clause.
   - Paragraph 4 also mentions the use of ""bleka"" 'or' at the end of the sentence to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1** (Clause-final question particle is present).

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that the interrogative clitic m can appear as a free word if it occurs clause-initially, but typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the predicate.
   - This indicates that the clitic can appear in various positions within the clause.
   - **Code: 1** (Clause-medial question particle is present).

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology:**
   - Paragraph 3 describes how the interrogative clitic =a attaches to the finite verb in verbal predications.
   - **Code: 1** (Interrogative verb morphology is present).

7. **Tone:**
   - There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0** (Tone is not mentioned as a strategy for forming polar questions).

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: Paragraph 4 explicitly states that ""Interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation to my knowledge."" Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions in Chácobo are formed by changing the word order. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Chácobo uses a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Chácobo uses a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: Paragraph 4 mentions that in non-verbal predicate constructions, interrogative clauses are marked with the morpheme ""ní"" which occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject. This suggests the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 35 provide evidence that in verbal-predicate constructions, interrogativity is coded in the clause-type/rank morpheme. Examples include ""ʔiní"" for non-past, ""ʔá"" for past, and ""ní"" for remote past. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone alone marks polar questions in Chácobo. Therefore, this strategy is not mentioned.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Hup,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can identify the following strategies for forming polar questions in Hup:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause compared to declarative and other Hup clause types, with a slight fall at the end of the clause. This suggests that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Hup.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar describes that predicate-focused polar questions involve word order inversion, where the constituent order is subject-final rather than verb-final. This indicates that interrogative word order is a strategy used in Hup.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar does not mention a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar describes the use of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ on the clause-final verb to mark polar questions. This indicates that interrogative verb morphology is a strategy used in Hup.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative statements.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The description of intonation patterns in polar questions suggests that intonation alone can mark a sentence as a question.
- **Interrogative word order**: The inversion of word order in predicate-focused polar questions indicates that word order changes are used to form questions.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: The use of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ on verbs to mark questions indicates that verb morphology is a strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative word order,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

   - Example: tsu'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re ‘what are you saying?’
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - Paragraph 21 describes the use of the interrogative mood marker -re attached to verbs to form questions.
   - Example: di'lİ 'cu-re ‘who is cutting (felling the tree)?’
   - **Code**: 1

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 11 discusses the use of rising tone at the end of the utterance in interrogative sentences, which is different from intonation. This suggests that tone is used to mark polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that ""Interrogative utterances do not show a final rising in pitch, but the question word receives the highest level of pitch."" This suggests that intonation alone does not mark polar questions.
   - Conclusion: 0

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 13 states that ""interrogative words remain 'in situ' depending on the grammatical role they fulfill and are rarely moved to the front of the clause."" This implies that word order is not changed to form questions.
   - Conclusion: 0

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: 0

Ticuna,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ticuna, the strategies for forming polar questions in the language can be identified as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation being the sole marker for polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no evidence or mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The particle ""chí"" is used in polar questions, as seen in examples like ""Tåu chí nà-mêʼü̃́ ēgá chōkù-üʼ̆ ma̰gú?"" which translates to ""Wouldn’t it be good if you gave me a wife?"" This particle appears clause-medially.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar questions is illustrated in examples like ""Kűnà-mêʼü?̃́"" which translates to ""Did you like it?"" This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions.

**Reasoning**:
- The particle ""chí"" is used within the clause to mark polar questions, indicating the presence of a clause-medial question particle.
- The use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar questions indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

**Conclusion**:

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions). Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 6 (11.2.2) explicitly states that polar questions in Murui are achieved by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate. This indicates that intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   - Paragraph 5 (11.2) confirms that polar questions have a distinct intonation pattern (rising-falling B2) compared to declarative sentences.
   - Conclusion: **1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs that word order changes to form polar questions. The morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of a declarative clause.
   - Conclusion: **0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in any of the paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: **0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in any of the paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: **0**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in any of the paragraphs.
   - Conclusion: **0**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 6 (11.2.2) mentions that polar questions in Murui can optionally omit the verb inflection for the 3rd person, but this is not a distinct interrogative verb morphology marker. It is more about the optional omission of inflection rather than a dedicated interrogative morpheme.
   - Conclusion: **0**

7. **Tone**:
   - The paragraphs do not mention the use of tone to distinguish polar questions from declarative sentences. The focus is on intonation rather than tone.
   - Conclusion: **0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iquito, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 states that ""Yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito. The only difference resides in the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, with yes-no questions displaying a rising pattern."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""The following three sentences all have SVO word order, with subject pronouns preceding verbs in (245) and (246), and a subject interrogative pronoun preceding the verb in (245)."" This suggests that word order does not change for polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:

   - Paragraph 4 provides examples of sentences where the intonation pattern changes to form questions, further supporting this strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Movima. The examples and explanations focus on intonation and particles rather than word order changes.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-medial question particle to form polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses interrogative verb morphology to form polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that in a yes/no question, the antepenultimate syllable carries stress and high tone, which suggests that tone plays a role in forming polar questions in Movima.

### Conclusion:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Bora,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Bora, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in Bora:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar states that questions are spoken with the same intonation as declaratives, but there may be tone changes (Paragraph 1). This suggests that intonation alone is not sufficient to mark polar questions, as tone changes are also involved.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 3 mentions that yes/no questions are formed by starting them with a ‘yes/no’ particle, as in examples 921 and 922. This indicates the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 1 mentions that there may be tone changes in questions, which suggests that tone is used to mark polar questions.

**Reasoning**:
- The presence of a clause-initial question particle is explicitly mentioned in Paragraph 3.
- The use of tone changes in questions is mentioned in Paragraph 1.
- There is no mention of interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, or interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

Wari',"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wari', we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 32 mentions that ""Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives."" This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can mark polar questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that a change in word order alone marks polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 2 states, ""The sentence-final particle quem is frequently used in yes-no questions."" This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to mark polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:

Aymara (Central),"To determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Central Aymara, I will analyze the provided paragraphs for any relevant information about the formation of yes-no questions. 

### Reasoning:

1. **Paragraph 10:**
   - Mentions the use of the suffix ""-ti"" in interrogative sentences: ""In sentences lacking a question word, the interrogative suffix -ti is used: cuns lurasctajja? ‘Seror, what are you doing?’ tatamajj yap lurasquiti? ‘Honey (little girl), is your father working the field?’""
   - This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

2. **Paragraph 22:**
   - Contains the phrase ""Tata, may jisct'asima. Sir, I have a question for you.""
   - This does not provide direct information about polar question formation but shows the use of the suffix ""-sa"" in questions.

3. **Paragraph 23:**
   - Mentions the suffix ""-sa"" attached to interrogative phrases introduced by a question word: ""The interrogative suffix -sa is attached to the last word of a question phrase. In interrogative sentences, the utterance final position receives the stress if it is in the final position.""
   - This suggests the use of a clause-final question particle.

4. **Paragraph 24:**
   - Discusses the use of the suffix ""-ti"" for alternative forms: ""The function of the infix 'ni-' in verbs, cf. with a final vowel: e.g. luravajjunewa, etc.""
   - This reinforces the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

5. **Paragraph 25:**
   - Contains examples of questions with the suffix ""-ti"": ""Jumajjautjapjjeti? mank'atautjapquiti.""
   - This further supports the use of interrogative verb morphology.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, Central Aymara uses interrogative verb morphology and a clause-final question particle to form polar questions.

**Chosen Option:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Trumai,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 21 mentions that it is possible to express interrogation without the use of the enclitic ""a"" by changing the intonational contour of the clause. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 26 reiterates that changing the intonation can indicate that the clause is a question, although it mentions that this method has limited use due to potential ambiguity.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 21 provides examples where the enclitic ""a"" is used after the element under interrogation, which can be at the end of the clause. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The enclitic ""a"" can follow any constituent under interrogation, which can be in various positions within the clause, including the clause-final position. Therefore, it can also be considered a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of tone being used to form polar questions.

Cacua,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cacua, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that no particular intonational pattern is required to exclusively mark interrogative clauses (Paragraph 7). This suggests that intonation alone is not sufficient to form polar questions in Cacua.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar states that interrogative clauses do not differ from declarative clauses in word order (Paragraph 7). Therefore, word order is not used to form polar questions in Cacua.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit is mentioned as a marker for polar questions and can occur at the end of the clause (Paragraph 2, Paragraph 5, Paragraph 6). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can attach to various parts of speech, including pronouns, nominalized or adjectivized verbs, and NPs (Paragraph 5). This suggests that it can occur in the middle of the clause, indicating the presence of a clause-medial question particle.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =nit is not restricted to verbs and can attach to other parts of speech (Paragraph 5). Therefore, it does not qualify as interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion**:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuracare,"Based on the provided descriptive grammar excerpts, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Yuracare:

### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:

""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""

This conclusion is based on the explicit mention of intonation marking polar questions and the absence of evidence for other strategies in the provided grammar excerpts.",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Kuna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuna, the following observations can be made regarding the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions):

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1: ""In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by intonation.""
   - Paragraph 3: ""A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement.""
   - Paragraph 8: ""The teacher drills the class using Sentences 1–5 below as yes/no questions.""
   - Paragraph 20: ""The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a question or a statement and writes 'question' or 'statement' on his answer sheet.""
   - These paragraphs clearly indicate that polar questions in Kuna are marked by intonation patterns alone, without any change in word order or additional particles/morphemes.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 explicitly state that the word order in questions is the same as in statements. Therefore, interrogative word order is not used to form polar questions in Kuna.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Uru,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Uru, the following strategies for forming polar questions in Uru can be determined:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar does not explicitly mention the use of intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, code 0.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions a tendency for OSV word order in yes/no questions without the question bound topic marker -xwi, suggesting that word order can mark polar questions. Therefore, code 1.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: The grammar does not mention a clause-initial question particle. Therefore, code 0.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of the question bound topic marker -xwi, which can occur in clause-final position. Therefore, code 1.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The question bound topic marker -xwi can also occur in clause-medial position. Therefore, code 1.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The grammar does not mention any specific interrogative verb morphology. Therefore, code 0.
7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, code 0.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation alone marking polar questions.
- **Interrogative word order**: The tendency for OSV word order in yes/no questions without -xwi suggests that word order can mark polar questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle.
- **Clause-final question particle**: The question bound topic marker -xwi can occur clause-finally.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: The question bound topic marker -xwi can occur clause-medially.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology.
- **Tone**: There is no mention of tone marking polar questions.

### Conclusion:

Camsá,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Camsá, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar mentions that yes/no questions can have any order and often end with the tag ""aiñe o ndoñ"" (‘yes or no?’). This suggests that intonation alone can mark a question, especially since no other obligatory markers are mentioned for all yes/no questions.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar explicitly states that yes/no questions can have any word order, indicating that word order is not a strategy for forming polar questions.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""ka"" is mentioned in example (20d) as a clause-final particle in a yes/no question. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions.

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: The presence of the tag ""aiñe o ndoñ"" (‘yes or no?’) and the flexibility in word order suggest that intonation alone can mark a question.
- **Interrogative word order**: The explicit statement that yes/no questions can have any word order indicates that word order is not used to form polar questions.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle.
- **Clause-final question particle**: The example (20d) shows the use of ""ka"" as a clause-final particle in a yes/no question.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence or mention of a clause-medial question particle.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no evidence or mention of specific interrogative verb morphology.
- **Tone**: There is no evidence or mention of tone being used to form polar questions.

Apurinã,"**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the relevant information extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 2** (8.8.2 Interrogative Speech Acts):
   - It explicitly states that polar questions in Apurinã are marked by rising intonation.
   - Example sentences (112a-d) illustrate that the only element distinguishing interrogative clauses from their declarative counterparts is the rising intonation.

2. **Paragraph 2** (8.8.2.1 Polar (Yes/No) Questions):
   - Confirms that polar questions are marked prosodically by rising intonation.
   - Provides examples (112a-d) showing that rising intonation is the sole marker of polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 2** (8.8.2.1 Polar (Yes/No) Questions):
   - Mentions a speech variety in the Fortaleza village where the morpheme –ta is used in the verb base to mark polar questions (e.g., pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’).

From this information, we can conclude the following:

- **Interrogative Intonation Only**: The primary strategy for forming polar questions in Apurinã is through rising intonation, as explicitly stated and illustrated in the examples.
- **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: In the Fortaleza village variety, the morpheme –ta is used in the verb base to mark polar questions, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

Other strategies such as interrogative word order, clause-initial, clause-final, or clause-medial question particles, and tone are not mentioned or indicated in the provided paragraphs.

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Kadiwéu:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions difficulty in eliciting simple yes-no questions and provides examples of wh-questions. It does not provide information on how polar questions are formed.
   
2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph discusses the incorporation of the interrogative ""ame"" in locative/existential predicates for questioning complements and adjuncts. However, it does not specify if ""ame"" is used for polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides an example of a wh-question but does not mention polar questions.

4. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph mentions the incorporation of the interrogative ""ame"" in locative verbs for questioning complements but does not specify its use in polar questions.

5. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph mentions that Noble Kadiwéu is a pitch-accent language, but it does not specify if tone is used to mark polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 33**: This paragraph provides an example of a declarative sentence but does not mention polar questions.

7. **Paragraph 39**: This paragraph provides an example of a conditional sentence but does not mention polar questions.

8. **Paragraph 50**: This paragraph discusses the phonological differences between Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu but does not mention polar questions.

From the information provided, there is no explicit mention of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in Kadiwéu. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the presence of any specific strategy for forming polar questions based on the given paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only:** 
   - There is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs that polar questions in Karajá can be formed solely by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence. Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that changing the word order alone can form polar questions in Karajá. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that there are two basic interrogative morphemes in Karajá, èbo and èwE, which are used to form polar questions. However, there is no specific information indicating that these particles appear at the beginning of the clause.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 3 does not specify the position of the interrogative particles èbo and èwE within the clause. Therefore, we cannot confirm if they appear clause-finally.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle:**
   - Paragraph 2 states that the interrogative word ado)èbo (♂ ao)èbo) occurs as a second-position clitic to form polar questions. This indicates that the interrogative particle can appear in a medial position within the clause.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology:**
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs of any specific verb morphology used to form polar questions in Karajá. Thus, this strategy is not confirmed.

7. **Tone:**
   - There is no information in the provided paragraphs indicating that tone alone is used to form polar questions in Karajá. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
