   - Paragraph 2 also mentions that some younger speakers use clause-initial ""eska"" (Fr est-ce que ...?), which is widespread in Malian languages. Additionally, a morpheme ""kona"" (variants koni, kooni) is attested as an apparent clause-initial polar interrogative marker (290b), though it is rare and possibly a dialectal borrowing from Fulfulde. This suggests the presence of clause-initial question particles.

3. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 5 states that clause-final polar interrogative ""ba"" is a characteristic feature of DjCh (Djenne Chiini), which is a variety of Songhay. This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles in at least some dialects of Koyra Chiini.

4. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:

Ik,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ik, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is a detailed analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions in Ik involve an ""interrogative intonation.""
   - Paragraph 2 further specifies that polar questions end with a low boundary tone, which is a characteristic of interrogative intonation.
   - Paragraph 5 also discusses the use of a low boundary tone and a slightly higher overall pitch level for polar questions.
   - Paragraph 11 reiterates the use of a low boundary tone for yes/no questions.
   - Therefore, interrogative intonation is clearly used in Ik.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples given do not indicate a reordering of constituents to form questions.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not evidenced.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not evidenced.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 8 mentions that Heine & König posited -a as an interrogative particle, but this analysis was deemed incorrect. The suffix {-a} marks nominative case and realis modality, not an interrogative particle.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not evidenced.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - Therefore, this strategy is not evidenced.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions involve the non-final form of the final morpheme in the clause.
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 11 also discuss the use of the non-final form of the final morpheme in polar questions.
   - Therefore, interrogative verb morphology is used in Ik.

7. **Tone**: 
   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 11 mention the use of a low boundary tone for polar questions.
   - Therefore, tone is used in Ik.

### Conclusion:

Ngiti,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ngiti, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no mention of changing the word order to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: Paragraph 1 mentions the question particle ""na"" which can be found clause-initially. Therefore, we code this as 1.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: Paragraph 1 also mentions the question particle ""ti"" which generally occupies the second position in a clause but can be clause-final as well. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: Since ""ti"" can occupy the second position in a clause, it can be considered clause-medial. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: Paragraph 4 mentions that the question particle ""ti"" is often reduced to just a High tone, which attaches itself to the preceding word. This indicates the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 1.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""","clause-initial question particle, second position question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"
Sidaama,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sidaama, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions:

1. **Paragraph 2**:
   - It mentions that Sidaama uses intonation for questions without any suffix. This indicates the presence of the strategy ""Interrogative intonation only"".
   - The question suffix `-ni` is mentioned as ungrammatical according to the consultant, which rules out the use of a clause-final question particle.

2. **Paragraph 20**:
   - This paragraph provides detailed information on the intonation patterns in Sidaama. It states that non-WH-questions are usually indicated by an intonation pattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarative counterpart. This further supports the presence of ""Interrogative intonation only"".
   - It also describes the pitch patterns for interrogative sentences, confirming that intonation is a key strategy for forming polar questions.

No other paragraphs provide explicit information about the use of other strategies such as interrogative word order, clause-initial/medial/final question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mursi,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mursi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takes sentence-final position with raised intonation. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 also supports this by stating that a polar question in Mursi can be formed by raising the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at the end of a clause.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that the syntactic order of constituents in declarative sentences and polar questions are exactly the same. This implies that Mursi does not use interrogative word order to form polar questions.

3. **Clause-Initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-Final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions that a polar question can be formed by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement. This suggests the presence of clause-final particles that can indicate a question.

5. **Clause-Medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

Majang,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Majang, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 all mention the use of a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause to mark polar questions. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a primary strategy for forming polar questions in Majang.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that polar questions do not differ in their order of constituents from their affirmative counterparts. This indicates that interrogative word order is not used.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - Paragraph 8 mentions a question marker that always comes at the end of a question, preventing the use of the interrogative sentence tone. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - Paragraphs 3, 4, and 8 discuss question markers (joː and kíː) that can appear near the beginning or in the middle of the sentence. Since these markers can appear in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial, we code for clause-medial question particles.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - The sharply rising sentence tone mentioned in Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 is a tonal feature used to mark polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 1""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 1"

**Conclusion:**
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Tamashek,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tamashek, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis of each paragraph relevant to the strategies:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that yes-no interrogatives can be formed with an optional question particle or just with interrogative intonation. This indicates the presence of two strategies: ""Interrogative intonation only"" and ""Clause-initial question particle.""

2. **Paragraph 2** specifies that clause-initial particles for polar interrogatives include ""dk"" and ""q p m m,"" and for eastern dialects, ""egaen"" or ""ajasn."" This confirms the use of clause-initial question particles.

3. **Paragraph 6** mentions that the clause-final particle ""ya"" can be used in yes-no questions, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle strategy.

4. **Paragraph 7** provides an example where ""ak"" is used in a clause-initial position before a topicalized NP, followed by a WH-interrogative. This supports the use of clause-initial question particles.

5. **Paragraph 9** includes an example where ""dk"" is used as a clause-initial particle in a yes-no question, reinforcing the clause-initial question particle strategy.

6. **Paragraph 18** provides an example of a polar question using ""dk"" as a clause-initial particle, further confirming the clause-initial question particle strategy.

From these paragraphs, we can conclude the following strategies are used in Tamashek for forming polar questions:

Gorowa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gorowa, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

**Paragraph 1** is the most relevant as it directly discusses polar questions. It states that polar questions are usually marked by the particle ""xáy,"" which occurs as the first element in the phrase. This indicates the use of a clause-initial question particle.

**Paragraph 5** mentions that the topic marker is used on polar questions, but it does not provide enough information to determine its exact position or function in forming polar questions.

**Paragraph 12** provides an example of the topic and question morphology, but it does not explicitly discuss polar questions.

**Other paragraphs** do not provide relevant information about the formation of polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the strategy for forming polar questions in Gorowa is the use of a clause-initial question particle.

**Output:**
```
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0

Shatt,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following relevant information regarding the formation of polar questions in Shatt:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Mentions a ""question word"" but does not specify its use in forming polar questions.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Discusses the use of the question word ""ti"" for asking about location, but this is not directly relevant to polar questions.
3. **Paragraph 5**: Lists ""Question Words (Interrogatives)"" but does not provide specific details on polar question formation.
4. **Paragraph 6**: Provides an example of a polar question: “ꞌDogi kawung tiyati?” which translates to “Did the thing come up?” This example does not show any change in word order or use of particles, suggesting that interrogative intonation might be used.
5. **Paragraph 16**: Another example of a polar question: “Alkodos tä Kamalänani mänangang?” which translates to “The pipe for Camel is like that?” Again, no specific particles or word order changes are indicated, suggesting interrogative intonation.

From the examples provided, it appears that Shatt forms polar questions using **interrogative intonation only**. There is no evidence of other strategies such as interrogative word order, question particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone changes.

Lamé,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lamé, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The particle ""su"" is consistently mentioned as occurring at the end of polar questions. This is evident in multiple examples:
   - (1) Taú tá lúmò su
   - (2) hí wé ndày só ndày su
   - (13) á ɬe ɗérwa ye su

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: The text explicitly states that elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses. This indicates that interrogative intonation is not used as a strategy.
   - ""Elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses.""

3. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as affirmative sentences.

4. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the examples provided.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-medial question particle in the examples provided.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of any morphological changes to the verb to indicate a question.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that the interrogative particle ""su"" can have different tones (mid or low), but this is used to place emphasis rather than to form a question. Therefore, tone is not used as a primary strategy for forming polar questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Wambaya,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wambaya, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 (7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS) states: ""Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence, but are said with a rising, questioning intonation."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 1**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses a different word order for forming polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-initial question particle is used.
   - **Code: 0**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that a clause-final question particle is used.
   - **Code: 0**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions an interrogative particle ""gayi"" which appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140) and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142). This suggests that the particle can appear in a medial position.
   - **Code: 1**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Wambaya uses specific verb morphology to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that tone is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code: 0**

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Wardaman,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wardaman, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions. Here is the reasoning for each of the seven strategies:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The paragraphs do not provide explicit information about the use of interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence or absence.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided text. Thus, we cannot confirm this strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided text that suggests the use of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 10 mentions the use of ""ale"" as a tag question marker, which is usually final in relation to what is questioned. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not provide evidence for the use of clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 3 mentions the interrogative suffix ""-gan"" which can be attached to verbs and other elements, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""

This conclusion is based on the explicit mentions of the clause-final question particle ""ale"" and the interrogative verb morphology involving the suffix ""-gan"". Other strategies are either not mentioned or explicitly stated as absent.",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Gooniyandi,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Gooniyandi, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each paragraph:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of the enclitic `-mi` or `-ma` to indicate indefiniteness and information focus. It mentions that polar yes/no questions are expressed by the assertion of a proposition with the intention of eliciting agreement or disagreement from the hearer. The enclitic `-mi` or `-ma` is usually added to the word on which information focus falls. This suggests the use of a clause-medial or clause-final question particle.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph provides examples of rhetorical questions but does not provide specific information about the formation of neutral polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph discusses the use of the indefinite enclitic `-wami` or `-wamiri` for disjunction but does not provide information about polar questions.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph explicitly states that Gooniyandi does not have a distinct grammatical category for questions and that the same forms are used for making statements and asking questions. This suggests that interrogative intonation might be used.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses the use of `mangaddi` as a response to confirmation questions but does not provide information about the formation of polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph provides examples of elliptical clauses but does not provide information about polar questions.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses the use of the indefinite plus `-ngaddaya` but does not provide information about polar questions.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses the use of `yiniga` and `miga` in various contexts but does not provide information about polar questions.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph discusses the use of `-mi` or `-ma` in the word `yaningimi` for requesting information but does not provide specific information about polar questions.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses the use of `ngoonyoo` in questions but does not provide specific information about polar questions.

11. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the placement of information focus and the use of indefinite words in information requests but does not provide specific information about polar questions.

12. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph discusses the use of `mangaddi` and `marlami` in responses but does not provide information about polar questions.

13. **Paragraph 13**: This paragraph discusses the use of proposals and exclamations but does not provide information about polar questions.

14. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph discusses the use of enhancing clauses but does not provide information about polar questions.

15. **Paragraph 15**: This paragraph discusses propositional modifiers but does not provide information about polar questions.

16. **Paragraph 16**: This paragraph discusses oblique bound pronominals but does not provide information about polar questions.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses the use of `mangaddi` in correlative constructions but does not provide information about polar questions.

8. **Paragraph 8**: Discusses indicative, realis forms, and other verb forms, not polar questions.
9. **Paragraph 9**: Discusses pronouns and gender, irrelevant to polar questions.
10. **Paragraph 10**: Discusses the use of ""ngarra"" for contrast, not polar questions.
11. **Paragraph 11**: Discusses the particle ""djawa"" which signals possibility and can signal a question form, but it is not explicitly stated as a polar question marker.
12. **Paragraph 12**: Discusses transitive verbs and negative prefixes, not polar questions.
13. **Paragraph 13**: Discusses pronominal prefix structures, not polar questions.
14. **Paragraph 14**: Continues discussion on pronominal prefix structures.
15. **Paragraph 15**: Discusses possessive constructions, not polar questions.
16. **Paragraph 16**: Discusses formation of verb forms from monosyllabic roots, not polar questions.

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Wagiman,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Wagiman, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.""
   - Paragraph 12 states, ""Polar interrogation is signalled by a marked intonation pattern over the sentence as a whole.""
   - This indicates that interrogative intonation is a strategy used in Wagiman.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that ""major constituent order is unaffected"" in polar interrogative sentences.
   - This indicates that interrogative word order is not a strategy used in Wagiman.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 9 mentions the tag form ""gale"" which ""occurs commonly in final position in questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour, has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the question by the addressee.""
   - This indicates that a clause-final question particle is used in Wagiman.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that ""most lpl intransitive questions are suffixed with -qana,"" but this seems to be more about distinguishing pronominal referents rather than marking the verb as interrogative.
   - There is no clear evidence of interrogative verb morphology specifically marking polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

English,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies used in English to form polar questions. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that polar questions can have the form of a closed interrogative clause but also provides examples where declarative sentences are used as questions (e.g., ""Your aim that evening, then, was to go to the discotheque?""). This implies that intonation alone can mark a question.
   - Paragraph 3 discusses the use of intonation to distinguish between polar and alternative questions, indicating that intonation plays a role in forming questions.
   - Paragraph 14 mentions declarative questions and their use of intonation to indicate a question.

   **Conclusion**: Interrogative intonation only: 1

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 provides examples of polar questions with subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., ""Can we afford it?"").
   - Paragraph 2 explicitly states that polar questions prototypically have the form of a closed interrogative clause, which involves subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., ""Is it breathing?"").

   **Conclusion**: Interrogative word order: 1

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

   **Conclusion**: Clause-initial question particle: 0

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

   **Conclusion**: Clause-final question particle: 0

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

   **Conclusion**: Clause-medial question particle: 0

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

   **Conclusion**: Interrogative verb morphology: 0

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

   **Conclusion**: Tone: 0

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Malayalam,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Malayalam, we can extract the following information regarding the formation of polar questions:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions that a sentence is transformed into a question by the addition of an interrogative element, but it does not specify the exact nature of this element.
2. **Paragraph 2** provides more specific information, stating that sentences are transformed into questions by the addition of the interrogative suffix ""-o"". This suffix is added to the end of the sentence, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.
3. **Paragraph 3** and **Paragraph 6** mention the addition of a negative question form and verb form changes, but these do not provide new information about neutral polar questions.
4. **Paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20** do not provide additional relevant information about the strategies for forming neutral polar questions.

Given this information, we can conclude that the primary strategy for forming neutral polar questions in Malayalam is the use of a clause-final question particle.

Nganasan,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Nganasan, we can determine the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation, with a high-pitch intonation pattern. This indicates the use of interrogative intonation for forming polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 also supports this by stating that if there is no verb in the sentence, the only marker indicating the interrogative mood is intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that word order does not play a fundamental role in forming polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is not used.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 states that if an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatorily takes the interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses, indicating the use of interrogative verb morphology.
   - Paragraph 3 further details the use of interrogative markers on verbs, supporting the presence of this strategy.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no specific mention of tone as a separate strategy from intonation in the provided paragraphs.

Ingush,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Ingush, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using only intonation to form polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The text does not indicate any special word order for forming polar questions. Instead, it mentions that the verb is generally in the second position in polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided text. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The interrogative clitic =ii is attached to the verb and appears to be clause-final in examples like ""tuox=ii?"" (strike?), ""diesh=ii?"" (read?), and ""viez=ii?"" (know?). Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: The interrogative clitic =ii is attached to the verb and does not appear to be clause-medial. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The interrogative clitic =ii is attached directly to the verb, modifying its form to indicate a question. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: The text mentions that the interrogative clitic has a prominent high pitch, which suggests that tone plays a role in marking polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 1.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Lezgian,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Lezgian, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The primary strategy for forming ordinary polar questions in Lezgian is the use of the interrogative mood affix **-ni** on the finite verb of the sentence. This is explicitly mentioned in Paragraph 1, where examples (1169a-e) illustrate the use of the suffix **-ni** attached to the verb to form yes-no questions.

2. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 3 mentions that if the question expresses surprise or doubt, the interrogative affix may be omitted, and the interrogative meaning is then expressed only by the intonation (rising on the finite verb form). This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions in specific contexts.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: Paragraph 6 mentions the sentence-initial particle **bes**, which is used in questions and often conveys the speaker's expectation of a negative answer. This particle is used at the beginning of the sentence, indicating the presence of a clause-initial question particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 8 introduces the sentence-final particle **q'wan**, which is used especially when a negative answer is expected. This particle appears at the end of the sentence, indicating the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 15 mentions the particle **meger**, which can be either sentence-initial or follow the verb. This indicates that **meger** can appear in a medial position within the clause, qualifying as a clause-medial question particle.

Given these observations, we can code the strategies as follows:

- **Interrogative intonation only**: 1
- **Interrogative word order**: 0
- **Clause-initial question particle**: 1
- **Clause-final question particle**: 1
- **Clause-medial question particle**: 1
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: 1
- **Tone**: 0

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Galo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Galo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The text does not mention any reorganization of word order to form polar questions. Instead, it emphasizes that polar interrogatives are formed closely based on main declarative clause syntax.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of clause-initial question particles in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The text explicitly mentions the use of clause-final interrogative particles such as ""ree"" for forming polar questions (e.g., ""mə́ə-máa-dùu=ree"" meaning ""Don’t you like it?""). This indicates the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The text does not provide evidence for clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The text mentions preferred inflections for polar questions, such as the use of ""Experiential perfect -bée"" and ""Stative -dó(o)"" in certain aspects, which indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided text.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the strategies for forming polar questions in Galo are:

- Interrogative intonation only: 0
- Interrogative word order: 0
- Clause-initial question particle: 0
- Clause-final question particle: 1
- Clause-medial question particle: 0
- Interrogative verb morphology: 1
- Tone: 0

### Final Output:

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Yup'ik (Norton Sound),"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yup'ik (Norton Sound), here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in the language:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 12 mentions that another means of coding a polar question is final rising intonation without the particle, which may sound more blunt than using the particle |qaa|. This indicates that interrogative intonation alone can be used to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

2. **Interrogative word order**: 
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: 
   - Paragraph 7 explicitly states that a sentence-initial |qaa| is unacceptable, indicating that the particle cannot be used in the clause-initial position.
   - **Code**: 0

4. **Clause-final question particle**: 
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7 indicate that the particle |qaa| is typically attached to the sentence-initial word but not as an enclitic, forming a bound phrase. This suggests that |qaa| can appear in a clause-final position if the initial word is the last constituent of the clause.
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: 
   - Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7 also suggest that |qaa| can be attached to the sentence-initial word, which can be in various positions within the clause. This implies that |qaa| can appear in a clause-medial position.
   - **Code**: 1

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 4 states that polar questions do not occur with an interrogative-mood verb, indicating that interrogative verb morphology is not used for forming polar questions.
   - **Code**: 0

7. **Tone**: 
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

### Reasoning:
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Mentioned explicitly in Paragraph 12.
- **Interrogative word order**: No evidence or mention of word order change.
- **Clause-initial question particle**: Explicitly stated as unacceptable in Paragraph 7.
- **Clause-final question particle**: Implied by the attachment of |qaa| to the sentence-initial word, which can be clause-final.
- **Clause-medial question particle**: Implied by the attachment of |qaa| to the sentence-initial word, which can be clause-medial.
- **Interrogative verb morphology**: Explicitly stated as not used in Paragraph 4.
- **Tone**: No mention in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","interrogative intonation only, second position question particle","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yuki,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Yuki, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Yuki by examining the relevant examples and descriptions. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: The paragraphs do not provide any evidence that Yuki uses a different word order for forming polar questions. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is consistently mentioned as being attached to the end of the verb to form polar questions. This suffix functions as a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no evidence that the interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) or any other particle can appear clause-medially. Therefore, we code this as 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The interrogative suffix -ha(ˀ) is attached to the verb, indicating that interrogative verb morphology is used. Therefore, we code this as 1.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided paragraphs, the strategies for forming polar questions in Yuki are as follows:

Tepehua (Huehuetla),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Tepehua (Huehuetla), we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) as follows:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that a yes/no question in HT is always formed using rising intonation. This is further supported by examples in Paragraph 1 (e.g., ""Did Carmelo load up my sacks?"") and Paragraph 6, which mentions the common omission of the interrogative pronoun jaa in yes/no questions, leaving intonation as the primary marker.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form yes/no questions. The examples provided show that the word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the interrogative pronoun jaa that occurs in the focus position at the beginning of a clause to form yes/no questions (e.g., ""jaa juu Karmeeluu"" - ""Did Carmelo load up my sacks?"").

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form yes/no questions apart from the rising intonation, which is already covered under ""Interrogative Intonation Only"".

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Musqueam,"### Reasoning:

Alsea,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alsea, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the reasoning for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no mention of intonation patterns related to forming questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of this strategy.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The paragraphs do not provide any information about changes in word order to form questions. Thus, we cannot confirm this strategy either.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial particle used to form questions in the provided text.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-final particle used to form questions in the provided text.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial particle used to form questions in the provided text.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The paragraphs do not mention any specific verb morphology used to form questions.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form questions in the provided text.

Given the absence of explicit information about any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs, we must conclude that none of these strategies are mentioned.

Arikara,"Based on the provided paragraphs, here is the analysis of the strategies for forming polar questions in Arikara:

### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**:
   - There is no explicit mention of using interrogative intonation alone to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

2. **Interrogative word order**:
   - There is no indication that word order changes to form polar questions. The paragraphs do not provide any examples or descriptions of word order being used as a strategy.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions the use of ""ka"" as a prefix to form questions. However, it does not specify that ""ka"" must be at the clause-initial position. It is used as a prefix, which suggests it is attached to the verb rather than being a free-standing particle.

4. **Clause-final question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Zuni,"### Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the provided paragraphs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph discusses the use of the suffix ""-p"" in question words. However, it does not provide clear information about the formation of polar questions.
2. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that question words undergo movement to the front of the Zuni clause. This indicates a strategy for forming content questions but does not directly address polar questions.
3. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph confirms that question words in Zuni are marked with the suffix ""-p"". This again pertains to content questions rather than polar questions.
4. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph provides examples of question words with the suffix ""-p"" but does not discuss polar questions.
5. **Paragraph 11**: This paragraph discusses the occurrence of strong WH words in single-word questions and as predicates, which is relevant to content questions.
6. **Paragraph 12**: This paragraph mentions multiple WH movements and the order of question words, which is again related to content questions.
7. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph illustrates the use of strong pronouns as responses to questions but does not provide information on the formation of polar questions.

None of the paragraphs explicitly mention the strategies used for forming neutral polar questions in Zuni. The information provided focuses on content questions (WH-questions) and does not address the formation of yes-no questions.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of explicit information on the formation of polar questions in the provided paragraphs, we must conclude that the grammar does not mention any specific strategy for forming polar questions in Zuni. Therefore, all strategies are coded as 0.

Columbia-Wenatchi,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Columbia-Wenatchi (Nxa?amxcin):

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly mentions that yes/no questions in Nxa?amxcin are marked by ""sa?"", which is represented as a particle. However, its status remains unclear.
2. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph indicates that yes/no questions are a focus of section 7.6, but it does not provide additional information on their formation.
3. **Paragraph 14**: This paragraph reiterates that non-declarative operations, including yes/no questions, are discussed but does not provide further details.

From the information provided, we can conclude that the particle ""sa?"" is used to mark yes/no questions. Since it is referred to as a particle and not explicitly bound to the verb, we can infer that it is a clause-initial question particle. However, the exact position within the clause is not entirely clear from the given data.

Maybrat,"Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Maybrat, the strategies for forming polar questions in Maybrat can be determined as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that all types of questions, including polar questions, behave intonationally the same way as other clauses, with a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause. This suggests that interrogative intonation alone is not used to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions that no variations in word order are required for forming polar questions. Thus, this strategy is coded as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar explicitly states that polar questions are characterized by the presence of the interrogative marker ""a"" in clause-final position. Numerous examples illustrate this usage. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

7. **Tone**: The grammar does not mention the use of tone to form polar questions. Therefore, this strategy is coded as 0.

However, it does not specify that these markers are exclusively clause-final. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence as clause-final only.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 3 indicates that the question markers ""en"" and ""an"" can be linked to various parts of speech within the clause, suggesting they can appear in medial positions. Therefore, we can confirm the presence of clause-medial question particles.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraphs 2 and 7 mention an interrogative suffix ""-an"" used with verbs to form interrogative sentences. Therefore, we can confirm the presence of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we cannot confirm its presence.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kuot,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Kuot, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here are the relevant points extracted from the paragraphs:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1: ""Yes/no questions have a very distinctive sharp pitch rise on the last syllable.""
   - Paragraph 7: ""Yes/no questions are marked only by intonation; primarily a sharp rise on the last syllable.""

2. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1: ""...a final particle a which can be added when a positive answer is expected.""
   - Paragraph 7: ""If an affirmative answer is expected a tag a can be added to the end of the sentence – this then carries the high pitch.""

From these points, we can conclude that Kuot uses two strategies for forming polar questions: interrogative intonation and a clause-final question particle when a positive answer is expected.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Abun,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abun, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 3 explicitly states that the intonation pattern for interrogative sentences is the same as that for indicative sentences, and intonation is not a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no questions in Abun. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   - **Code: 0**

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form yes/no questions in the provided paragraphs. The structure of yes/no questions seems to rely on particles rather than word order.
   - **Code: 0**

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraphs 6, 9, and 18 mention the optional use of the initial question marker ""te"" for yes/no questions. This marker can appear at the beginning of the clause.
   - **Code: 1**

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraphs 6, 9, and 18 indicate that the final question marker ""e"" is obligatory in yes/no questions. Additionally, ""ne"" and ""o"" are also used as final question markers interchangeably.
   - **Code: 1**

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The particles ""te"" (initial) and ""e"" (final) are used in specific positions (initial and final, respectively). There is no evidence that these particles can appear in a medial position within the clause.
   - **Code: 0**

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of any special verb morphology used to form yes/no questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code: 0**

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 3 states that the intonation pattern for yes/no questions is the same as for indicative sentences, indicating that tone is not used to distinguish yes/no questions.

Iau,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Iau, we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: There is no explicit mention of using intonation alone to form yes-no questions in the provided paragraphs.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**: There is no indication that Iau changes the word order to form yes-no questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: There is no evidence of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: The paragraphs indicate that Iau uses the unstressed particles ""be"" or ""ba"" at the end of the clause to form yes-no questions. These particles can occur with different tones to indicate varying degrees of certainty or expectation of input from the hearer (e.g., ""ba³"" for uncertain information).

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: The paragraphs describe changes in the tone of the verb stem when forming yes-no questions. For example, a tone 9 verb changes to a tone 7 in yes-no questions.

7. **Tone**: The tone on the question marker ""be"" or ""ba"" varies to indicate different degrees of certainty or expectation of input from the hearer. This indicates that tone plays a crucial role in forming yes-no questions in Iau.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""","clause-final question particle, tone","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Karkar-Yuri,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we need to identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in Karkar-Yuri. Here is the analysis of the relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 3** mentions the use of a clitic for forming questions. It states: ""filled unit with clitic which consists of an obligatory ecf nuclear Subj, tagna and two optional and the Stative pos clause Topic The vsorat verb ta action phrase, the HP Pred tagu was, Time Appositional or siarker obligatory positional the topic eyuational optional tean and pro: aux an pronoun, ovlizatory ref stative peripheral Location pronoun Pred has noun, tior: yuuestion tag meme Popic word Complinent stative @::tC0omplisent interrogaltive topic: subj tword locative Subj: apots and athe Predicatedual focus the continuous +me present mement reference expressimuediatetime by future as that The an obligatory optional action is made is, related to both.""

   This suggests the presence of a question clitic that can be attached to various constituents within the clause. Since it can follow any constituent, it can be clause-medial or clause-final.

2. **Paragraph 4** provides an example of a question: ""Did you see the snake?"" This indicates that questions can be formed using a specific structure, but it does not specify the exact strategy used (e.g., word order, particles).

3. **Paragraph 10** mentions the use of a clitic for indicating questions: ""Verb, indicates result clita offocv¥ teq = Cairnan preceding it is closeuction is Likely actions. to finishing! to happen in the near.""

   This reinforces the idea of a question clitic being used in the language.

4. **Paragraph 12** and **Paragraph 20** do not provide explicit information about polar questions but discuss the structure and use of morphemes in the language.

From the analysis, we can conclude that Karkar-Yuri uses a question clitic that can be clause-medial or clause-final. There is no explicit mention of other strategies such as interrogative intonation, word order, clause-initial particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"

Sentani,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Sentani, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions that polar questions can be formed with prosody, specifically rising intonation, which can function as a question marker in itself when added to an otherwise indicative sentence (93a). This indicates the presence of interrogative intonation as a strategy.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples and explanations do not indicate that word order is altered to form yes-no questions.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that suggests the use of a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions the use of the emphatic particle ""jæ"" at the end of a sentence to indicate that the scope of the question is over the whole sentence (93b). This suggests the presence of a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that suggests the use of a clause-medial question particle for forming polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that the irrealis mood is used in question sentences, which is unmarked both morphologically and in suffix ordering (79a). However, this does not specifically indicate interrogative verb morphology for polar questions.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mpur,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Mpur, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: Paragraph 2 explicitly states that questions are not expressed by means of intonation alone. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs to suggest the presence of a clause-initial question particle.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 5 provide clear examples of the question marker `-e` being used as an utterance-final clitic in yes/no questions. This confirms the presence of a clause-final question particle.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs to suggest the presence of a clause-medial question particle.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: Paragraph 2 mentions that questions are marked morphologically, but it specifically refers to the clitic `-e` rather than any verb morphology. Therefore, this strategy is not confirmed.
7. **Tone**: Paragraph 2 mentions that the question-marking clitic `-e` is realized with a salient, large rising or falling pitch movement. However, this does not indicate that tone alone is used to form questions, but rather that it accompanies the clitic.

### Conclusion:

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Mehek,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions in Mehek as follows:

1. **Clause-final question particle**: The primary means of asking a polar question in Mehek is via the interrogative clitic =ka, which attaches to the final element in the clause, most often a verb. This is evident from multiple examples:
   - (225) ru kom=k rusu-ya-r=ka ""Is he staying in the village?""
   - (226) [ifi afa] waki-r-kya-f=ka ""Will the two of them tie it up badly?""
   - (227) ikinu kaku a-na=ka ""Would you not eat mami?""

2. **Clause-medial question particle**: The clitic =ka can also attach to other elements within the clause, not just the verb, indicating that it can function as a clause-medial question particle as well. For instance:
   - (233) ke-sbu=r eku-ya-s=ka ""What is she doing? Is she wasting time?""
   - (281) ke-sbu=m eku-ya-s=ka ""What is this one [she] doing?""

3. **Interrogative verb morphology**: When the subject is second person singular, there is generally no overt marking of the sentence as a question, but the form of the verb is distinct from that in a corresponding declarative sentence. This suggests the presence of interrogative verb morphology:
   - (245) kasukna-ya=ø ""Are you sleeping?""
   - (246) woro biki yoko wula=k ""Will you go to the jungle tomorrow?""

4. **Clause-final question particle (alternative)**: The clitic =ben is used to form polar questions with the meaning 'or', indicating an alternative question particle:
   - (265) suwa glengu=r ser ser ana ra=ben ""Perhaps I will take the coconut pod first?""
   - (27) ana naku ra=ben ana kaku mami ra=ben ""Shall I get sago or mami?""

5. **Interrogative intonation only**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative intonation as a strategy in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative word order**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative word order as a strategy in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**: There is no explicit mention of tone as a strategy in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",clause-final question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Abui,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Abui, we can analyze the strategies for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language.

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:

   - Example: ""Simon nala nee"" (Simon eats something) vs. ""Simon nala nee?"" (Does Simon eat something?).

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no explicit mention of a change in word order to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The examples given maintain the same word order for both declarative and interrogative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of specific verb morphology used to indicate polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to differentiate polar questions from declarative sentences in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:

Alamblak,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Alamblak, the following observations can be made regarding the strategies for forming polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Yes/No Interrogative Clauses are morpho-syntactically indistinguishable from an independent declarative clause"" and that ""Interrogative is intonationally marked."" This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Paragraph 3 also supports this by stating that yes-no questions tend to have rising intonation.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. Paragraph 8 specifically states that ""an interrogative element is not fronted in the clause, but it is ordered in the same way that the grammatical relation it is questioning would be in a declarative sentence."" This implies that word order remains the same as in declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

Mian,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - The grammar mentions that polar questions in Mian are characterized by a specific intonational pattern, involving a short peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance. This indicates that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - The grammar explicitly states that constituent order does not change in questions. This means that Mian does not use interrogative word order to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 0

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative clitic =m can appear as a free word clause-initially, indicating that it can function as a clause-initial question particle.
   - **Code**: 1

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative clitic =a encliticizes to the final constituent in the clause, and the particle bleka ‘or’ can also appear at the end of the sentence to form polar questions.
   - **Code**: 1

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - The interrogative clitic =m can encliticize to the final constituent before the verb, indicating that it can function as a clause-medial question particle.
   - **Code**: 1

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - The interrogative clitic =a attaches to the verb in verbal predicates, but it is not restricted to the verb only. Therefore, it does not qualify as interrogative verb morphology.
   - **Code**: 0

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Code**: 0

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-initial question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Chácobo,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Chácobo, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language.

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation (Paragraph 1). Therefore, this strategy is absent.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no mention of a specific word order change to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Hence, this strategy is not confirmed.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: The grammar mentions the use of morphemes such as =ʔiní, =ʔá, =ʔaí, and =ní as interrogative markers (Paragraphs 1, 2, 5). These morphemes appear at the end of clauses, indicating the presence of clause-final question particles.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative morphemes (e.g., =ʔiní, =ʔá, =ʔaí, =ní) can occur in various positions within the clause, including medial positions (Paragraphs 1, 2, 5). Therefore, this strategy is also present.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative morphemes =ʔiní, =ʔá, =ʔaí, and =ní are bound to the verb, indicating the presence of interrogative verb morphology (Paragraphs 1, 2, 5).

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""","clause-medial question particle, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Hup,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Hup, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Here is the analysis for each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 4 mentions that intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause compared to declarative clauses. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used as a strategy.
   - Paragraph 1 also notes that intonation peaks clause-initially and falls at the end of the clause in interrogatives.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 5 states that predicate-focused polar questions involve word order inversion, which is a distinctive feature of Hup polar questions. This inversion is used specifically in polar questions with pronominal subjects.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 3 mentions the use of the discourse-marker =b’ay, which follows the clause-final subject in polar questions. This marker can be considered a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no specific mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 describe the use of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ on the clause-final verb, which replaces the Declarative marker -Vêh. This suffix is a clear example of interrogative verb morphology.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 1, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative word order,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 1, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

7. **Tone**:
   - Paragraph 10 mentions that tone rises at the end of the utterance in the interrogative mood, indicating the use of tone to mark questions.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 1""","interrogative intonation only, interrogative verb morphology","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 1"
Huambisa,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huambisa, we can identify the strategies for forming polar questions as follows:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: 
   - Paragraph 17 mentions that interrogative utterances do not show a final rising in pitch, but the question word receives the highest level of pitch. This suggests that interrogative intonation is used to mark questions.
   
2. **Interrogative word order**: 
   - There is no explicit mention of a change in word order to form polar questions. The examples provided focus on content questions and do not indicate a reordering of elements to form yes-no questions.
   
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: 
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   
4. **Clause-final question particle**: 
   - Paragraphs 3, 7, and 9 mention the use of the clitic =pa as a question marker, which can occur in various positions, including clause-final. This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle.
   
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: 
   - The same clitic =pa can occur in various positions within the clause, including clause-medial, as indicated in Paragraphs 3, 7, and 9. This suggests the presence of a clause-medial question particle.
   
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: 
   - There is no explicit mention of interrogative verb morphology specific to polar questions in the provided paragraphs. The discussion of verb morphology focuses on content questions.
   
7. **Tone**: 
   - There is no mention of tone being used to distinguish polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Cocama,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Cocama, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis of each strategy:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 5 mentions that polar questions can be indicated solely by prosody, specifically with an intonation contour described as ""slowly ascendant pitch plus abrupt rising at the end."" This confirms the presence of this strategy.
   
2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 2 discusses subject-verb inversion as a strategy for forming polar questions. This involves fronting the verb without marking it with =tipa, which indicates a change in word order to signal a question. Although this strategy is noted to be less productive in texts, it is still present.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 describe the use of the clitic =tipa, which attaches to the end of the questioned element. Since the questioned element must occur in the first position in the clause, =tipa appears at the end of this element but not necessarily at the end of the clause. Therefore, this does not qualify as a clause-final question particle.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 indicate that =tipa can attach to the first element of the clause, which can be any constituent in the sentence. This qualifies as a clause-medial question particle since it can follow the first constituent, which can be in various positions within the clause.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology specific to forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used as a strategy for forming polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

Huitoto (Murui),"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Huitoto (Murui), we can determine the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 2 (11.2.2) explicitly states that polar questions in Murui are marked by a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate. This indicates that interrogative intonation is a primary strategy for forming polar questions.
   - Paragraph 10 (434) also mentions that in questions, predicative roots have a sharp rise of pitch followed by a fall.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Murui uses a different word order for forming polar questions. The morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of a declarative clause (Paragraph 2, 11.2.2).

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Murui uses a clause-initial question particle for forming polar questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Murui uses a clause-final question particle for forming polar questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Murui uses a clause-medial question particle for forming polar questions.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 2 (11.2.2) mentions that there is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the 3rd person in polar questions, but this does not constitute a distinct interrogative verb morphology. It is more of an optional feature rather than a dedicated interrogative morphological marker.

7. **Tone**:
   - The intonation pattern described involves a sharply rising pitch followed by a fall, which is a feature of intonation rather than tone. Tone typically refers to the use of pitch to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning, which is not indicated here.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Iquito,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information regarding the strategies for forming polar questions in Iquito:

   - Example from Paragraph 1: ""A yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation.""
   - Example from Paragraph 2: ""The basic stress and intonation rule for a yes/no question is the following... stress and high tone fall on the antepenultimate syllable of the entire utterance.""

2. **Interrogative Word Order:**
   - There is no mention in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a specific word order to form yes/no questions. The focus is on intonation rather than syntactic reordering.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle:**
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-initial question particle to form yes/no questions.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle:**
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-final question particle to form yes/no questions.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle:**
   - There is no evidence in the provided paragraphs that Movima uses a clause-medial question particle to form yes/no questions.

Trumai,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Trumai, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the language. Let's analyze each paragraph for relevant information:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph explicitly states that polar questions in Trumai require the use of the enclitic ""a,"" which occurs after the element under interrogation. Examples (1)-(4) illustrate this usage. Additionally, it mentions that a change in the intonational contour of the clause can also indicate a question.
   
2. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph notes that using only intonation to indicate a question is limited and can cause ambiguity. It confirms that the use of the enclitic ""a"" is preferred and frequent.

3. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph provides an example of a question using the enclitic ""-ni"" attached to a verb, indicating another form of interrogative morphology.

From these paragraphs, we can deduce the following strategies for forming polar questions in Trumai:

- **Clause-medial question particle**: The enclitic ""a"" can follow any constituent, which can be in various positions within the clause. Therefore, it can be considered a clause-medial question particle.
- **Clause-final question particle**: Since the enclitic ""a"" can also appear at the end of the clause, it functions as a clause-final question particle.
- **Interrogative intonation only**: Although less common and potentially ambiguous, changing the intonational contour of the clause can indicate a question.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-final question particle, clause-medial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Apinayé,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract the following information relevant to the formation of polar questions in Apinayé:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions a ""question clitic that introduces polarity questions in Apinajé.""
2. **Paragraph 9** provides explicit examples of polar questions:
   - Example (45.a): ""co na ka ra a-tujaro?"" glossed as ""Q. RLS 2 ASP 2-pregnant"" meaning ""Are you pregnant yet?""
   - Example (45.b): ""co kt kaj ajt a-tujaro?"" glossed as ""Q. IRLS 2.IRLS more 2-pregnant"" meaning ""Will you get pregnant again?""
   - This indicates the use of a clause-initial question particle ""co"" or ""c"" for forming polar questions.
3. **Paragraph 19** discusses the positional clitic ""na"" for realis mode and ""kt"" for irrealis mode, but does not provide additional strategies for forming polar questions.

From these paragraphs, we can conclude that Apinayé uses a clause-initial question particle to form polar questions. There is no mention of other strategies such as interrogative intonation, word order changes, clause-final or clause-medial particles, interrogative verb morphology, or tone.

### Conclusion:

""Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 1, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0""","clause-initial question particle, interrogative intonation only","interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 1, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Yagua,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract information about the strategies used for forming polar questions in Yagua.

2. **Interrogative word order**: There is no explicit mention of interrogative word order being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

4. **Clause-final question particle**: Paragraph 5 provides examples where the question particle -viy appears at the end of the clause (e.g., ""JidyeetuviyjQnaachara?"" and ""Sa-ya-viy Quiti-mi-jw?""). This indicates the presence of a clause-final question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

5. **Clause-medial question particle**: Paragraph 1 mentions that yes-no questions can be formed with a preverbal element, and Paragraph 5 shows examples where the question particle -viy appears after the subject and before the verb (e.g., ""Naanaaviyjantyuuyjiryiiva?""). This indicates the presence of a clause-medial question particle. Therefore, we code this as 1.

6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: There is no mention of interrogative verb morphology in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, we code this as 0.

Cacua,"### Reasoning:

1. **Interrogative intonation only**: The grammar explicitly states that no particular intonational pattern is required to mark interrogative clauses. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
2. **Interrogative word order**: The grammar mentions that interrogative clauses do not differ from declarative clauses in word order. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
3. **Clause-initial question particle**: There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
4. **Clause-final question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can occur at the end of the clause, as seen in examples where it attaches to the verb or other clause-final elements. Therefore, this strategy is present.
5. **Clause-medial question particle**: The interrogative clitic =nit can attach to various parts of speech within the clause, including verbs, pronouns, and nouns, which can be in medial positions. Therefore, this strategy is present.
6. **Interrogative verb morphology**: The interrogative clitic =nit is not restricted to verbs only and can attach to other parts of speech. Therefore, this strategy is absent.
7. **Tone**: There is no mention of tone being used to mark interrogative clauses in the provided paragraphs. Therefore, this strategy is absent.

Kuna,"### Reasoning

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of the Kuna language, the following observations can be made regarding the formation of neutral polar questions:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that the order of words in a yes/no question is the same as in a statement and that questions are distinguished from statements by intonation in conversation.
   - Paragraph 2 provides examples of yes/no questions where the intonation is crucial.
   - Paragraph 15 further elaborates on the intonation pattern, noting that the pitch of a question is higher than that of a statement, with the last word of a question being even higher in pitch before falling off quickly.

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 15 both indicate that the word order in yes/no questions is the same as in statements, implying that interrogative word order is not used to form polar questions in Kuna.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in any of the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in any of the provided paragraphs.

Warao,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Warao, we can identify the strategies used for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**: 
   - Paragraph 2 mentions that ""Rising intonation is associated with questioning,"" but it also states that this matter has not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, while there is an indication of rising intonation, it is not clear if it is the sole marker of polar questions.
   - **Conclusion**: 1 (since there is some evidence of its presence).

2. **Interrogative Word Order**: 
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs about changing the word order to form polar questions.
   - **Conclusion**: 0.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**: 
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 both mention the use of the sentence-final verb suffix ""-ra"" as an interrogative marker. This suffix appears at the end of the clause.
   - **Conclusion**: 1.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**: 
   - There is no evidence or mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**: 
   - Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 describe the use of the suffix ""-ra"" attached to the verb to mark interrogative sentences. This suffix is part of the verb morphology.
   - **Conclusion**: 1.

7. **Tone**: 
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.
   - **Conclusion**: 0.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 1, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""",interrogative verb morphology,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 1, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"

Apurinã,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs from the descriptive grammar of Apurinã, we can determine the strategies for forming polar questions in the language. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Interrogative Intonation Only**:
   - Paragraph 1 explicitly states that polar questions in Apurinã are marked prosodically by rising intonation. This is a clear indication that interrogative intonation is used to form polar questions.
   - Example: ""In all of these examples, the only element that distinguishes the interrogative clauses from their declarative counterpart is the rising intonation.""

2. **Interrogative Word Order**:
   - There is no mention in any of the paragraphs that Apurinã uses a different word order to form polar questions. The examples provided maintain the same word order as declarative sentences.

3. **Clause-initial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-initial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

4. **Clause-final Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-final question particle in the provided paragraphs.

5. **Clause-medial Question Particle**:
   - There is no mention of a clause-medial question particle in the provided paragraphs.

6. **Interrogative Verb Morphology**:
   - Paragraph 1 mentions a morpheme ""-ta"" used in the verb base to mark polar questions in the speech variety of the Fortaleza village. This indicates the presence of interrogative verb morphology in at least one speech variety of Apurinã.
   - Example: ""The equivalent of the sentence in (112b) in this speech community will be pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’.""

7. **Tone**:
   - There is no mention of tone being used to form polar questions in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
""Interrogative intonation only: 1, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 1, Tone: 0""

This conclusion is based on the explicit information provided in the paragraphs, which indicate the use of rising intonation and, in some speech varieties, the use of a specific morpheme ""-ta"" in the verb base to mark polar questions.",interrogative intonation only,"interrogative intonation only: 1, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 1, tone: 0"
Kadiwéu,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we need to determine the strategies for forming polar questions in Kadiwéu. Here is the analysis of each paragraph:

1. **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph mentions that simple yes-no questions were not found and attempts to elicit such questions resulted in sentences like ""When did you find clay?"" This suggests that polar questions might not be straightforwardly formed or might not use a specific strategy mentioned in the list.

2. **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph discusses the incorporation of the interrogative ""ame"" in locative/existential predicates and the movement of interrogative ""ame"" with the prefix ""ig-"". However, it does not explicitly mention polar questions.

3. **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph provides an example of an interrogative sentence using ""ame-i-jo"" but does not indicate it is a polar question. It focuses on ""who"" questions.

4. **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph mentions that complements can be questioned by incorporating the interrogative ""ame"" in a locative verb, but it does not specify polar questions.

5. **Paragraph 5**: This paragraph discusses a negative marker for imperative and conditional clauses, which is not relevant to polar questions.

6. **Paragraph 6**: This paragraph discusses transitivizing suffixes and constructions with third-person objects, which is not relevant to polar questions.

7. **Paragraph 7**: This paragraph discusses responses to questions about who said something, which is not relevant to polar questions.

8. **Paragraph 8**: This paragraph discusses differences between SVCs and biclausal structures, which is not relevant to polar questions.

9. **Paragraph 9**: This paragraph provides examples of sentences but does not mention polar questions.

10. **Paragraph 10**: This paragraph discusses differences between SVCs and biclausal structures, which is not relevant to polar questions.

17. **Paragraph 17**: This paragraph discusses categorical distinctions in linguistics, which is not relevant to polar questions.

18. **Paragraph 18**: This paragraph discusses prosody in Noble and Non-Noble Kadiwéu, which is not relevant to polar questions.

19. **Paragraph 19**: This paragraph discusses pitch-accent in Noble Kadiwéu, which is not relevant to polar questions.

20. **Paragraph 20**: This paragraph provides a glossary of terms and symbols, which is not relevant to polar questions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of any of the seven strategies for forming polar questions in Kadiwéu. Therefore, we must conclude that none of the strategies are mentioned.

**Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 0, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0**",not mentioned in the grammar,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 0, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
Karajá,"### Reasoning:

Based on the provided paragraphs, we can extract relevant information about the strategies for forming polar questions in Karajá:

1. **Paragraph 1** mentions the interrogative word ""èbo"" occurring as a second-position clitic to form polar questions. This indicates the use of a clause-medial question particle.
2. **Paragraph 2** further clarifies that ""èbo"" and ""èwE"" are interrogative morphemes used interchangeably, and they can occur as second-position clitics. This reinforces the use of a clause-medial question particle.
3. **Paragraph 8** provides an example of a polar question: ""ÎaÎErI Îa-∅-aèÎ-ErI ano)bo? ado)bo,"" where ""bo"" is used as a question marker. This example supports the use of a clause-medial question particle.

No explicit mention of the other strategies (interrogative intonation only, interrogative word order, clause-initial question particle, clause-final question particle, interrogative verb morphology, or tone) is found in the provided paragraphs.

### Conclusion:
Interrogative intonation only: 0, Interrogative word order: 0, Clause-initial question particle: 0, Clause-final question particle: 0, Clause-medial question particle: 1, Interrogative verb morphology: 0, Tone: 0",second position question particle,"interrogative intonation only: 0, interrogative word order: 0, clause-initial question particle: 0, clause-final question particle: 0, clause-medial question particle: 1, interrogative verb morphology: 0, tone: 0"
